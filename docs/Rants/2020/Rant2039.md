My mum would buy something impressive for herself and tell people her children got it.

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Of course, there are many things we buy for her, but my mother bought her home by herself many years ago.

She is her own landlord. It's her money! 

Recently, she got herself another valuable effect... but she is about to announce to the world that her kids gave her as a gift. 

I rolled my eyes and told her to own her greatness.

"We didn't buy it for you, mummy. You bought it yourself and there's nothing more amazing than that. It's all YOU. Own it."

I can't imagine giving credit to a man or kids for something I bought. Nehi!

I won't take anyone's credit. But I sure as hell won't share mine.

If I bought it, then it's mine.

I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it - Ariana Grande style.

Mum wanted it and she got it. She should bask in her awesomeness without apologies.
