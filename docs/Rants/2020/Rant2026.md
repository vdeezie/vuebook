I was trying to read an article, one time, that was attacking Lola Shoneyin, then the writer described Lola as contemptible because she is not on good terms with an individual.

This writer was denigrating Lola’s character based on the fact that she didn't have a good relationship any longer with someone she (the writer) believed was noble.

I stopped reading immediately. I hissed and left the page.

I am also not "on good terms” with this same individual the writer decided to use as a measure of good character.

So does that also make me a horrible person? Because I am not a friend to your friend?

You people write this rubbish all the time with your chest, and you think because it is written in perfect sentences it passes for objectivity.

You want to judge a woman’s character based on the people YOU think are distinguished.

So one day, you'll realise someone else you also admire finds your Distinguished character to be unremarkable, how then do you choose to twist your mouth?

You badger Lola for her biases, yet you lot show up every day with the same sentiments, but because you do it with nobodies struggling for clout, you think your prejudices are justified and hers are not.

You want to save your lousy unrewarding e-friendhsips, but Lola cannot save her book festivals.

Please gedifok!

You lot and all your opinions and judgments punctured with prejudices are duly noted.
