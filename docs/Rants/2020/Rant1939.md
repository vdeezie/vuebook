My greatest problem now is how to manage my time living in Accra and working on movie sets in Lagos?

Do I get an apartment in Lagos?

Do I stay in hotels?

How do I manage my resources, yet live in a sane country (Ghana), and work in a chaotic city (Lagos)?

The scriptwriting part can be done anywhere in the world... 

But to have the holistic experience as a filmmaker, I have to be on Nollywood sets.
.

I feel like 2020 is the year I'm going to sacrifice alot of personal comfort to meet my ambition.

Movie sets are gangsta, and producers keep telling me I may not fancy it.

Scriptwriting is bougie. Every other process in filmmaking is not.

Nollywood set is the ghetto, as I hear.

But I am ready. Been ready.

I have managed to free myself from nine-to-five for this Nollywood ambition...

Now, how do I work around living and working in two different countries?
