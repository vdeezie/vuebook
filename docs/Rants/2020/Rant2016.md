People who spend half their lives as self-proclaimed victims, find it very hard to take responsibility when it is time to do so.

You see them trying to swirl back to victim mode.

"But what did I do? What did I really do wrong?" They torment themselves over and over.
.

You don't know what you did?

You gave the barest minimum in situations that required more from you.

You continually came to the table with nothing, yet expected to be fed and recognised. 

You gave very little in relationships that demanded you show up fully human.
.

But someone who loves being a victim will go back to their mattress at home and try to emotionally remove themselves from responsibility. 

It's what they do.

It's who they are.

Ignore them.

Their narcissism is top notch. And if you look closely, it is that coy narcissistic approach to life that keeps them from becoming.
