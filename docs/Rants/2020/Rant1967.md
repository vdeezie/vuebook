See ehn, let me advice you small in 2020...

You're going to have to decide whether you want to be Smart or you want to be Woke.

They both have their rewards.

Smart - you are going to work with the existing system in your industry and try to create good work with the platforms you are giving, upgrade stuff with a sense of humility, make money, and live a life that feels like a vacation everyday.

OR...

You are going to be Woke, full of empty talk, yapping shit about the system, act like you are better than the system (this one always makes me laugh), front like you are too big to work with the system... and remain BROKE.
.

You. Are. Broke.

You don't have money to fix even a door knob.

You. Are. Nothing.

If you are too big for the structures that exist in your industry, create your own or shut up!

And yes...

Have you fvcking eating today?

Do you have rent money?

If you have stomach pain from the bile in your system, for instance, do you have money for a bed space in ordinary General Hospital?

These are the issues, niccurs. 

These are the issues.

The Smart outlives the Woke.

Cockroaches and butterflies.
