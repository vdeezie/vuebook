1. You paid for Ads on my Facebook page.

2. I post Ads.

3. One company called and asked for 25 pieces of your product.

You could have declined if you did not have the capacity to deliver.

As a matter of fact, you shouldn't pay to advertise on my wall if you do not have the capacity to deliver.

I know what I am saying. We used to sell out Nzuri even before the next batch would get to us.

I'll say that again: people would pay for Nzuri body wash and scrub in advance - before the next batch. It was crazy. 

5. I am sure you got many other companies and individuals making requests from the Ads I posted. You could have declined.

6. You were paid 65% upfront from this company.

7. But when you delivered the product, it looked nothing like what they ordered. NOTHING. 

8. They rejected the products because they look nothing like what they asked for. You told them to state what they don't like about the products so you could fix it. HOW do you fix a product already delivered? How? They wanted it for an occasion. A Valentine occasion to send to all their clients. You messed that up! You fvcking messed that up! You should not have taking the order!

8. They told you to wait for management to approve the products. You say you have other deliveries to make. 

9. You leave. They keep calling you to come back and take your products. You say they are threatening you... "Because of what? Because of ordinary so-and-so money?!"

Wow! Wow!! Wow!!!

All of a sudden the money you make from your business is "ordinary so-and-so". Wow!

10. The company had no choice, they had to reach out to me because they would NEVER have heard about you or patronise you if it weren't for the paid Ads of your business on my wall.

11. They send pictures of what they ordered and the 25 boxes of what you delivered...

Even I was ashamed.

I apologised profusely, even when I have no bone in this business. 

12. I call you on all platforms. I send messages. Your customers were also sending messages. You ignore us.

13. Then I do a post to remove myself from this ghetto behaviour you are displaying...

All of a sudden you come out from the dark, AND YOU RESPOND TO MY POST.

You ignore all our calls and messages, but you dare respond to my post. And you dare try to sub me!

YOU ARE MAD!!!

That kind of familiarity is why I NEVER agree to Ads on my page for a very long time.

You don't come to my wall to defend your mediocrity. You must be outta your fvcking mind!

What do you take me for?!!

You think I would stand with you because you paid for Ads?!!!

I saw the pictures! The customers sent me pictures!

This company would have opened a hundred doors for you!

What the fvck is wrong with you simpletons? What???
.

How do you think I make money as a writer?

I write one brilliant script. I write it with blood and sweat and crazy imagination...

And more scripts follow!

That's how business works.

You satisfy one customer, they introduce you to others.

I have written for all your WCW! All of them!

Because I wrote one good script a long time ago for Emem Isong.

After that, the blessings never stopped.

But you simpletons treat yourself, your business and your clients like shit!

And now you want to throw me into the mix and you think I'd let you off so easily.

You are defending the shit you did. 

Imagine that!

The only thing you should do is APOLOGISE to your customers and REFUND their money...

Or whatever compromise you both can come to.

Because what they ordered and what you delivered are worlds apart!

Don't be silly! And don't try to play this card like an average Nigerian!

You will not brag your way out of this.

I won't let you do that!

I don't need this shit!

BE PROFESSIONAL!

I am on the customer's side! They sent me evidence.

Don't annoy me any further else I'll post those pictures.
.

This is why I never take Ads on my wall!

This is beneath everything I stand for!

Do the right thing! Pay for your own fuck up!

Or go back and learn the new tricks of your trade to meet up with certain aesthetics.

I am preserving a bit of your dignity by NOT tagging you to this.

Only a few can connect the dots.

Take it gracefully, and repair the damages you caused.
