One Nigerian says... 

"SARS slapped me at Ojota."

Another Nigerian responds...

"You need to move to the Island. SARS do not slap on the Island, they only kick you. And if they kick you, you kick back. Kick is better than slap."
.
.

This is why I have no time or respect for the Nigerian engagement. 

It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle than to find sensible conversation about life amongst Nigerians.
.

Try it wherever you are. Start a conversation on just about anything and see how bread will turn to crumbs.

We are doomed.

Because real change begins with smarter conversations.

But how do you engage people who think a slap from SARS can be negotiated by moving to the Island?

How do you respect people who think the answer to being robbed with a gun in Badagry is moving to Ajah where they rob with sticks.

How do you people engage with one another on this level?

Complaint: "I spent two hours in traffic today."

The Nigerian answer: "Why don't you move to Ikoyi? At least you can buy salad in a three-hour Ikoyi traffic."

We are just a bunch of jokers.
