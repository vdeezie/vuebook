# Rant1995


February 20, 200

Today, I finished a feature film script in 4 days.

You know how I did it?

I didn't enter the kitchen to do any elaborate cooking.

That gave me more hours to get my primary assignment in this life (scriptwriting) done faster than usual.
.

You know how much I made in 4 days?

I'm not telling. You'll pass out.
.

Did I eat good food during those 4 days?

Yes, of course! I always eat good food.
.

What did I do today for getting shit done so effortlessly?

Took a ride to town and went shopping.
.

Who is a happy woman?

Me! I am a happy woman.
.

Will food ever be a problem for moi?

Never.
.

Will cooking ever stand between me and the hours I need to work, write, fart, fuck, live or Netflix?

Never!
.

Moving on to the next project like the genius that I am.

Saving up hours. Accomplishing more...

Making more money so I never have to make cooking a priority in my life.

Moral of this rant...

Don't be a penny-wise-pound-foolish loser.

Peace âœŒ
