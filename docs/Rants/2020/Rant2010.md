I remember the catarrh and cough I had when I was heading back to Lagos from London in 2018.

Chai! It was so bad, my nose was bruised from all the sneezing. 
.

I was sitting next to this dude on the plane who didn't make a fuss about it. Once in a while, he'd say, "Sorry" or "Bless you."

Imagine having that kind of cough now.

Jeez!!!

When I was travelling back to Accra from Lagos last week, I called my Accra driver to pick me up from the airport, as usual.

He hesitated and said, "There is corona in Nigeria".

I said, "Ehen! So you will not pick me?"

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
.

When I landed, he was there, waiting to take my bags.

Bless him! ðŸ˜‚
.

While he was driving me home, I desperately wanted to cough. It was just a simple cough to clear my throat o!

But I wouldn't dare! I couldn't!

If I did, that man would have jumped out of his car and left me there!

I was sure of it.

Of course, he was scared. Why wouldn't he be? ðŸ˜‚

So I twisted my neck until the cough didn't need expression any longer ðŸ¤£

PS: I hope the world heals, abeg! This virus needs to go!
.

PSS: People are excited about cheaper travel fares...

And I'm here thinking...

Shouldn't you be isolating yourself from crowds and gatherings?

How can you even think of a vacation to certain places at this dire time?
