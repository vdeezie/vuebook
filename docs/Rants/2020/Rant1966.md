So, last weekend when Prisca stayed over at the hotel...

This madam was receiving "agony aunt" calls all night!

Da fuq! I couldn't believe it.

Prisca was on the phone till 1am in the morning. Slept for barely four hours, woke up again to another "dear Jolomi" call, and started advising these callers in the wee hours of the day!

Whew!

She got so busy with this ministry and had to enter the toilet to receive the rest of her calls after she sensed my legendary irritation.

Even when she was in the toilet, her compassion for these women pealed through the doors and into my sanity and my deliberate tranquility.

I threw my duvet over my head, yet I could still hear Prisca's words of advice...

"Don't worry! I say no worry! Jus' born the pikin. That man go hear am for this life if e nor show, you hear? God nor dey sleep."

... something like that.

Hian!

I threw an extra pillow over my head.
.
.

I kid you not, bestie sat on the toilet seat for hours attending to the needs of these Nigerian women.

And when she crawled back into the room to try to get a minute sleep...

Her phone rang again ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
.
.

This is the simple conclusion of our individual status...

This is why I am a baby girl, and my bestie is mother of all nations.

ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Dear Prisca, may God show you love and favour and compassion as you show to your other friends - the ones on the other side of life, the ones I will never know.

You are worthy of 2020 blessings o! Walahi!

Because as you see me so...

I cannot can.#Rant1966
