Many Nigerians set up companies just so they are ready for that grand moment...

That moment on Facebook or Twitter...

That moment when they would get into yet another useless e-argument with e-people...

And one of their detractors would scoff...

"All you do is talk! Try and run a kiosk before you criticise so-and-so."
.

Now, it is time to shine.

The moment has come to finally blurt out..

"I. Run. Three. Businesses. As. An. Entrepreneur. And. I. Have. Twelve. Employees. On. My. Payroll. So. Shut. The. Fuck. Up."

That's it.

That's the vision and mission statement of their company.

The sun can set now.

They can return to depression.
