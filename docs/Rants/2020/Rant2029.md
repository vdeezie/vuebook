Book smart for girls is not enough.

Teach your daughters how to be street smart.

They must understand the lingo and tactics of narcissists and fuckboys.

They must learn how to navigate office politics, bad relationships, entitled men, angry men, pick-mes, bad policies, feminism lite... 

They must grasp the ways and patterns of Patriarchy. Their peace and confidence rest on their understanding of this system - because this is the system that governs society.

They must learn power, and how it can be used to build or destroy.

They must own their sexual, social and emotional agency.

Teach them not to hold on to fear and not to cower.

Because in the big bad world, a good degree will get you a job and a nice car and a crib...

But it will not save you from betrayal, heartbreak, emotional scammers, bullies, online trolls et al.

An academic degree will not help you through an abusive relationship; it will not help you make better life choices.

Take them to the best schools you can afford...

But teach them about life.
.

Because, by jove, it is not right for a woman with a PhD to suffer depression and shame because of a broke fuckboy!

That is not how life should happen.

At all!

Book smart is so limiting. Learn about LIFE.

Thanks.
