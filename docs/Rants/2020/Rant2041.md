One incident that always makes me laugh.

I got into Lagos from Accra.

The Boyfriend booked me into a hotel.

At the reception, deluxe room was going for N59,999 per night.

A promo fee for the weekend.

He told them I'd be staying longer. They said they will retain the fee as courtesy for our patronage.

He said he'd rather book online.

He made payment online.

Online rates didn't adhere to the promo rates at the reception, yet this man paid and wasn't aware, at the time, that he just paid N77,000 per night!!!

It was the third night... it hit me like a dream. I woke up suddenly, grabbed my phone and did the calculation.

Ah! I slapped his arm.

"Dude, you paid more than the rates for this room online."

"How?"

"The reception said N60k per night, you paid N77k online!"

He squinted out of sleep.

"Shit!"

"What is wrong with you?! Three days later and it didn't occur to you that you paid more?!" I screamed.

"Go to bed, babe," he said.

He wasn't interested in the conversation at all and it only made me angrier 😂

"This is crazy! How can you pay more and not be aware that you are paying more?!!"

"I see you and I get too excited! OK? That's it! That's the problem. Go to bed!"

Hian!

So I said calmly, "Next time you get too excited, just send me all the money in your account and I shall spend it wisely."

We laughed and made love 😊❤

PS: If you travel often, you will most likely be a card-carrying member of some hotel franchise. There's an amount you'd spend on hotel living that will entitle you to a free night or two anywhere in the world, as long as that particular hotel is there.

This is for those who may wonder how we were able to have sex after "wasting money". 

Frequent travellers simply pay forward.

I'm guessing this is what would eventually happen in this case, but I never asked... so I don't get mad all over again 😂

PSS: My favourite pastime is staring at beautiful hotel rooms online. I was doing just that this morning when I remembered this story and smiled 😊

I love hotel-living. On my bucket list: I plan to stay in all the 5-star (or 4-star) hotels in, at least, 25 countries.
