Nigerian married women (and pick-mes) spend their entire time shaming other types of women and badgering other occupants of the earth to... "get married and submit to man and monogamy."

But the minute they step out of line - the same line they pretentiously believe every woman should tread...

These e-feminists start to defend them.

Talkmbout, "why do we care what they do?"

Y'all must be drunk!

Why won't we care what married women who spend half their time shaming other types of women... why won't we care what they do?

These women fell for a Venice trip that suggests they abandon their husbands and fly into the sun with another man...

These Nigerian married women who chew other types of women and their lifestyle for breakfast...

Yet you want us to look the other way when they choose to be hoes.

Again, y'all must be drunkards!

These Nigerian women are currently paying random men for sex to payback cheating husbands.

I mean... what kind of trash behaviour is that?

How low can dirt go? How low?

Yet second chapter of e-feminists are trying to guilt trip the rest of us for having opinions on the choices married women make.

You people are mad!

You think being a Nigerian married woman excludes you from insort?

You think you are above insort because you are the beast of burden.

A hateful, jealous, bitter beast of burden?

You don't want us to criticise your poor choices the way you do other women?

LMAO!

Again and again, you are drunk!
