Random things I miss:

1. Strutting in Kotoka airport with my wheeled travel bag, acting all bougie, having jollof rice at the chic restaurant for 65 ghc 🍽
.

2. Staying in Oriental hotel, loving the view of the ocean and the lights from Lekki bridge, ear phones on listening to music 🎇
.

3. Fine dining. When I relish an expensive meal. When it hits you and makes you appreciate the art of food as a career someone else should have. Priceless! 😁
.

4. Movenpick hotel (Accra): I look forward to the morning jog in the expansive outdoor 😊
.

5. I miss planning with The Boyfriend. 
For the hundredth time, he couldn't meet the plane schedule to Cape Verde (there are specific days to fly from Lagos to the destination), I was livid and then he proposed that we go to Ivory Coast the next day, so we don't waste a perfect season we could spend together. He sent me pictures of some luxury hotel/resort we could run away to.

I remember screaming, "What the fuck is Ivory Coast?!!!" 😂😂😂

Apparently, it would be a more expensive trip than Cape Verde, which annoyed me even further 🤣🤣

I said, no! Thinking it would work to my benefit since he would feel guilty and make up for it in a big way...

Then covik came to town not long after! Now I can't go anywhere. Smart, Joy. Very smart! 😭😭
.

6. Shopping, especially dresses and bras. I love the smell and feel of new things.
.

7. Cunnilingus. I am blessed to have a man who loves to eat pussy. So blessed. Phew! 😇
.

8. Evening drives on the Island on Sundays with ambient music, a warm weather, and the smell of The Boyfriend's cologne. Sigh ❤
.

9. The voices of my daughters. Their laughter. Their gossip and conversation through the walls. By jove, I love 🥰
.

10. The freedom I enjoy - to do whatever I want, and go wherever I want 😥
.

It is well.
