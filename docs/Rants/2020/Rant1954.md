Listen, when you find a misogynist who writes well, spewing shit about any trending matter...

Do NOT share his post in a bid to bash him. 

Do NOT give him audience. 

Do NOT invite others to taste his bitterness.

Do NOT try to educate him by screen grabbing his post.

Do NOT do anything.

Leave him with his 25 likes per post and 180 followers.

Do NOT give that animal room to wag his tail.

Do NOT sponsor misogyny by trying to shame misogyny.

If you want to talk about the same trending issue, talk about it without drawing angst from the rap of a "clever" chauvinist.

Just leave him. Let him remain small and unknown.

You people will not hear!

Every single time you take the words of a deliberate fool and spread it to thousands of people who ordinarily would not have heard of him or his opinions... you are destroying the ecosystem.

Yes.

Let these people remain inside a hole.

Whew!

Read. See the number of likes - 25.

OK. Bless God. Then move on.

Leave him to his antics right there inside a bottle.

Stop making these people famous.
