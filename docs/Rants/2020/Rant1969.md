I had a boyfriend once who would always turn, when he got to his car, to wave one last time before driving off after a weekend together.

He would wink or wave, but whatever he chose to do, he always tried to catch a glimpse of me one last time, on the balcony, before driving off.

That was his shtick.

One day, I stood on the balcony and he didn't turn around when he got to his car.

That moment, I knew it was over. So I stopped investing emotionally in the relationship.

He thought it wasn't over. But I knew it was.

It was only a matter of time before his consciousness would catch up. 
It was only a matter of time before he admitted to himself - that small performance of goodbye was an important part of our affection. 

His action wasn't deliberate, of course. He stopped it unconsciously because affection was waning.

That moment, standing on the balcony, without a wave... I watched the car disappear and sighed.

I went into my apartment and mourned the loss before it was lost.

Moral of the story: You gotta be proactive about a break up.

Bwahahahahahahahaha! ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
