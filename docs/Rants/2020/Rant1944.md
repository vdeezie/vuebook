There's no serious employer who is ever going to employ you because...

"I need the job to feed my family."

Or...

"I need the job to survive."

It's not about you. 

It's about the company and what value you bring.
.
.

For really smart employers, it's not even about them or how they feel about you.

They don't have to like you. They only have to agree with your energy. 

They have to stan your grit and smarts to deliver.
.
.

I don't know when Nigerians will understand this.

Always tell people what you can offer them, not what you can get from them.

Your culture of "unmerited favour" have you out here acting like a dolt.

This is a really simple method - think of what you can give. It is in your giving that you can receive.

It is in your giving that you can even ask for more.

But first you must give - of your time, your resources, your intellect, your experience, your knowledge, your skill and talent, everything!

But like "am" and "I am", you are still struggling with something so easy to understand.
