Today was crazy.

I was trying to move from Opebi to Ikeja GRA where I can book into Radisson hotel OR Providence by Mantis...

I ordered my Uber. I saw the the surge in price - twice the normal price.

Of course, traffic...

But nothing - absolutely nothing - prepared me for the traffic I witnessed on Sheraton link road.

By jove! I spent almost two hours from Opebi to Sheraton link road. A distance that should normally take 10 minutes.

The Uber a/c was humming irritatingly in my ear and puffing hot air!

The uber driver and I agreed it would take us three hours to get to GRA from Sheraton link bridge with the way traffic was building.

He asked if I wanted to go back to the hotel he picked me...

I said NO! I want a five star hotel! I sulked!

I worked hard all weekend and I deserve 5-star treatment.

I really felt like crying.

But the traffic was only getting worse.

So I called the hotel along the link road that I normally ignore.
.

When I got to the reception... I met the brightest smile waiting for me from one of the receptionists. 

A small lady with the sweetest smile.

And I felt so relieved.

I can't explain it.

That smile from a random receptionist at a hotel made me believe everything would be OK.

They offered me a complimentary glass of juice with ice.

I sipped, and it healed me of all my weariness.
.

So I decided to tell her what her smile did to me.

"I walked in here and you smiled, and I felt at home."

They all "awwed".

Her name is Grace. 
.

I mean... this isn't the hotel I wanted so badly to stay in today, but life happened and I am here.

It is a 3-star hotel. Not bad at all, but I wanted more. I deserve more.

But her smile was the extra star that made me feel luxurious.

Her smile and her professional kindness made up for the ambience I desperately want from those extra star hotels.

I know she was just doing her job... but that IS the point -

If you do your job well, you do not have to do anything else!

Just do your job.

Grace didn't have to be extra, all she had to do was her job - smile warmly at the customer and be kind and professional.

That's it.

Smile if you are the first contact to any business.

And not the kind of smile that suggests you want a tip.

NO, please! Get lost!
.
.

So here's a smile from me to you - a gift I got from Grace.

I'm tired AF, but I hope this makes you smile too.
.
.

Wait! When you show off your dentition, it's a smile, right?
