One of the skills I desperately want to learn is...

Travelling alone and enjoying it.
.

For someone who loves living alone, it's so strange that I find travelling alone so hard to do and uncool.

I have no idea how to enjoy a vacation alone out of my comfort zone. And this has slowed down all of my travel desires.

I think I know what the problem is...

I really hate to engage, and travelling requires alot of extrovert energy and vibe that I don't have.

So if I travel with someone, it allows me pass that responsibility on to that person.

Still, I don't just want to travel with just anyone.

You are going to be sharing a bit of personal space so it has to be with someone you even LIKE.

Phew.

I sincerely do not wish to be in Lagos or Accra right now.

I want to be lost somewhere.

I want to be lost!

Do you understand?

And I have to do this before school closes this term when I need to be close to Lagos for the sake of my kids.

Sigh.

I've been consuming articles on "how to travel alone and loving it".

Not one of the articles has inspired me.

It's all so stressful 💆‍♀️💆‍♀️
