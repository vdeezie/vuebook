The first time I picked a bible to read, I was ten.

It was my mother's bible. 

I tried to read a chapter from the old testament. 

I couldn't relate to all the threats, so I dropped it and went for a novel.

The second time I attempted to read a bible, without the interference of church or CRK in school, was a few years later. I think I was 14.

This was the first verse I believe I read...

"In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"' - Isaiah 4:1

I was like... "Wow! This is crazy!"

I tried to imagine how this could ever be necessary. I couldn't.

Then I laughed and said to myself, "This is definitely for the masses."

I scoffed and added,  "This will never be me."
