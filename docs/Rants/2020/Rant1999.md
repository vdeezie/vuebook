Women are ALWAYS trying to convince men they are not with them for the money or material things...

Even when the money he has, in his entire life, can only buy Sprite and meatpie... and lubricant. 

And his worldly possession is a mattress... and a stove.

Yes, she wants your mONeY, all right. The money you are not making.

Dumbdididumb.

These niggaaz are carefully, they hAvE tO bE sUrE iT Iz lOvE.

- Because they can manipulate love.

They can twist and stretch and poke and squeeze and turn love into any form of perversion that tickles them.

You can exploit love.

But you can't manipulate a woman who knows exactly what she wants.

She wants money.

You mad broke?

Get out of her way!

Simple.
