Don't be a statistic.
.

They'll dedicate one day to you and your plight...

Talk a load of intelligent and unintelligent stuff about your gender...

Brands will pander to your situation, write witty or shitty content and Ads, patronising and commercializing your reality...

The entire world will get up, only for one day - may be a few more days - to applaud and announce your strength or weakness or whatever.

Then they return to their lives, their businesses and truths.

They return to their truths where you don't stand a chance, where you don't matter, and your reality only valuable for the optics.

Don't be a statistic.

Own your life.

Rewrite your narrative.

Step out of the numbers. Step away from the general notion or misfortune society expects of your position, your gender.

WIN.

Do what you know better than anyone else.

Win, damn it!

And fvck all these silly stereotypes and one-day celebrations that have no real ambition to change you.

It is not the job of the world to change you. The world can only empathise or sympathise. 

Nobody can make you great. No matter how many days are dedicated to you. No matter the number of great quotes you share.

Greatness is a lonely grind. Not a clique.

The gender that owns most of the world's success knows this.

Win. Period.
