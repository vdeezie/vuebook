Opera News is trending. 
.

Opera News called everybody to the yard.

They signed every single writer they could find, willing to be signed.

And that was what made it very unattractive - to me.

And the money wasn't bougie. And that's wrong - for me ðŸ’…

And I was bored with all the pictures of sign-ups everywhere. 

I cringed actually.

I wonder the kind of business model that would require employing everyone to write for you - and I mean everyone!

Phew.
.

You know how oblivious you are to the many white Toyota Highlander in town, until you buy one... then you see it everywhere. 

I didn't concern myself with Opera News until they reached out.

Then I realised we were all about to drive white SUVs.

Haba. No nah.

Black never looked so desirable.

Metaphorically speaking, of course.

There are no car deals involved in these negotiations.
.

Also, I have a phobia for working for Lebanese, Indians, Chinese (et al) in my country.

A country with no active labour laws.

I can only imagine how they take advantage of the system.
.

I have an aversion for a lot of things - The Nigerian Police, politicians, pastors, abusive stepmothers, stingy employers, broke patriarchs, and pick-mes...

Hiring writers like a pack of chips is also on that list.
.

PS: I am yet to read one Opera article. I'm sure they are amazing.

For all true writers, may you find your power.
