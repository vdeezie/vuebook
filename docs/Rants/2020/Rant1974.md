Wait for it...

I decided to become an actress.

😂😂😂

I know. I know.

I started thinking about it last year,  November.

I allowed the thought torture me for a while...

This year,  I told one of my filmmaker mentors.

She didn't laugh, which immediately skyrocketed my confidence.

These things matter. 

She was kind. She was very kind. She held my hand and said, "It is OK for you to want to be anything."

Then  she said, "You are beautiful, Joy. And your age needs more representation in Nollywood screen, so yes I will support this. You will hear from me soon."

She will never understand what she did to me at that moment. She changed my thoughts and anxiety to a plan.

She added, "Tell other filmmakers too. You never know."

"Ah! I don't know about that o! I am shy," I hesitated.

She chuckled, "YOU, shy?"

😁😁😁

She insisted I tell others.

So with renewed confidence, I told another filmmaker on WhatsApp. 

All the while I was cringing. Lol!

She replied with a simple, "Lol! Really?"

Three days later, she sent me a script for a movie.

And it is not a waka pass role.

I am going to be playing boss lady, with fine-fine wigs and smashing clothes with the required oomph my character is expected to bring!

I screamed o! I screamed all around my room! Jumped on my bed and danced, then I kissed my screen.

Actually, she gave me two roles to choose from. I chose to be boss lady.

So I'm gonna go shopping as a back-up plan.

Shoot starts this new week 💃💃💃

I haven't told The Boyfriend yet. I will tell him today.

I know it's midlife crisis...

But, at least, I am not using all our money to buy sports cars 😂😂😂

This midlife crisis is only making me more ambitious - to try new things.

Something must "kill" a woman nah! 💅💅💅
.

Wish me luck on my first movie role.

I am ready for everything - flaws included.

It will only get better.

Pray for me, dearies.

Hopefully turning 43 this year doesn't freak me out and I relocate to Cape Verde for a year 🤣🤣🤣

PS: Screenwriting is still the ish. Don't even get it twisted. More money and power from behind the screen.

Just thought I should emphasise that.

I love my life 😊❤
