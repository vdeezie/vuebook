Please allow people to be unforgiving towards their Nigerian parents if they want to be.

Stop projecting your (faux) family happiness on others.

You don't know their story.

You did not grow up in their home.

And most importantly, you do not know what their triggers are. 

You do not get to treat their mental health flippantly based on your own idea of what family represents. 
.

Your mother is amazing after inserting pepper into your vagina for chatting with a boy, yes?

Good for you!

Allow others to despise their parents for lesser abuse.

It is not a competition.

Allow others to express pain however they want.

Stop policing people's hurt.

For many Nigerians, "family" is a painful memory.

Stop badgering them to forgive.

Fvck off with your forgiveness.
.

If someone says... "My mother/father hurt me and I will never forgive her/him"...

Sigh and tell them you are sorry for whatever experience that got them to feel this way.

Then buy them a drink, or something.

That's it.

Making a big deal out of their decision is vile.

Just stop and geddifok!
