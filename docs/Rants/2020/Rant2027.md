Whitewashing is an insult to anyone with any form of integrity and intelligence. 

Do not let anyone tell you to pack your bags and follow them to Nirvana.

You are not ready for Nirvana. You've got a few more stops to make in Dystopia. 

Do not be distracted by their silly ass inspirational posts. They are vile. They are beasts. 

They are supporters of badly behaved men and women.

I have ended friendships with everyone that smells of bleach from constant whitewashing. They are disgraceful.

It they wear the robe of a nun right now, they will still be disgraceful. As they are 

They insult you with the subtle and/or desperate need to exonerate the reprobates in their care.

If they try to judge you based on your need to give expression to your experience, tell them to go to the mountains and sing hakuna-matata with Simba.

It remains none of your business.

Let them direct that energy to their friends who continuously disrespect other people - misogynists and pigs, scammers and criminals.

You are doing just fine. You don't need their love or approval.

They ain't shit. 

You know your way to paradise when it is time.

You chose to be in hell for the moment.

Because fire is a beautiful sight to watch.

You're all right.
