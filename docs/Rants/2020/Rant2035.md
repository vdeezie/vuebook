Society does not want women to be happy.

I mean... really happy.

Society does not want women to be abused either.

Society wants women to be OK.

Just OK.

A satisfactory job here. An average love life there. A decent lifestyle there.

Society still wants you to feel a little insecure sometimes. Deal with a bit of wickedness here, and a bit of pain there.

You know... carry your burden naturally like a tortoise carries its shell.

Society does not want a man flogging you with a belt o! But it sure as hell does not want you having access to unlimited happiness either.

Women's happiness should be in small doses.

If you are truly fulfilled as a woman, society will call you a liar.

😂😂😂

They are projecting. Let them.

You are the one living your life. You are living your truth. Enjoy it without any apologies.

Do not be ashamed of the smart choices you have made.

I celebrate every woman living a fine life, one she deliberately designed for herself.

I celebrate women who are ruthlessly determined.

I celebrate the Camila Vargas of the world.

I celebrate the real slay queens living the luxury life without so much as breaking a sweat.

Do not feel guilty, women are out here selling their souls to wicked men.

You are doing just fine out there, you devious queens.

Your machiavellian manoeuvres in life are necessary in a society governed by Patriarchy. 

Be wise as serpents.

You are the ones who will succeed.

The world is not ready for your badassery.

Go and get the world you want. 

Do not ever repent.

You are queens!

"Well-behaved" women seldom make history. They are boring too.

All the best, queens 👑👑👑

I salute you and all your unconventional ways.

❤❤❤
