I used to have small dreams...

Later I had big dreams...

I was exhausted and had dreams I could accomplish...

Then it got bigger...

Then smaller...

Big dreams...

Small dreams...
.
.

Now I have NO dreams.

And it is the best times of my life.
.

I have NO dreams, folks!

I will easily build a tent anywhere I am needed. 

I ain't planning shit.

That's it.

No dreams.

I want to check something.

Let's see how this phase goes.
