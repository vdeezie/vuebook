I sincerely don't know why I'm still in Lagos.

Actually I do.

There's always money to be made somewhere in this city.

If you check the crevices of your field, there's always a stray one million naira or even five hundred thousand naira somewhere that you can own if you speak a good game and execute properly.

But you see Accra...

When you enter your house, that is it o!

Your income doesn't increase, it only depreciates ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

No random call from an elite entrepreneur who needs creative work and tells his PA to "call the lady on Facebook who writes like magic".

Nothing like that in Accra.

But in Lagos? If you want it, and you work towards it, you most likely will get it.

That kind of hope is refreshing.

Someone will definitely call. They always do.

I even got a call from a Nigerian company last year operating in Accra...

When I did the cedis to naira exchange, monthly salary was N350k for a fulltime job.

I couldn't take it.

However I wanted to call Roberta to come over to Accra and take the job. She would stay with me and go to work every day.

But she already started working at a new company as a Content Manager in Lagos and in charge of everything. The money isn't as good as the offer I had, but positioning far better.

So I didn't even tell her... lest she chooses money over experience ðŸ˜‚

I only told her yesterday and she wanted to cry. She won't understand. 

Anyhoo...

I don't know jare! This January is one kain. I've been floating around and largely dissatisfied.

Things are moving really slow.

I know what I want... I just don't know how long it will take because I am impatient.

But as always... when they start to happen, I won't be able to catch up.

I need that adrenaline rush.

I'm losing my mind moving around like a pseudo-rich housewife.#Rant1956
