Monogamy is always throwing tantrums...

Always disturbing our peace with information we neither asked for nor care about.

Always in our faces. Always misrepresenting itself...

Always fighting temptation.

Always repeating the same mistakes.

I mean... Monogamy has been disappointing itself for  centuries.

Imagine fighting the same sin for 2,000 years!

"Do nOt sLeEp wITh aNOther pelZin."

Simple instruction, yet Monogamy will fvck it up!

Aren't you people tired?! 

Hian!
