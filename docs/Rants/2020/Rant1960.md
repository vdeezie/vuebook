I can never forget how some Nigerians complained about a movie (I wrote) having the nerve to make them laugh and cry at the same time.

Azzin... they were complaining for feeling different emotions watching the movie.

I cannot can with these people of this great nation.

You are uncomfortable that a movie made you laugh in some scenes and sad in other scenes.

Whew.

Make it make sense.

If you do not like the production, say you do not like the production.

If you don't like the cast, say you don't like the cast.

But try - I beg you - try to have a conversation with yourself that makes sense.

Try.

Is it that you want to laugh all through OR you want to cry all through?

Why are you afraid to feel different complex or not-so-complex emotions watching one movie?

Did you not feel different emotions in one day? Did you laugh all day? Did you cry all day?

Reason am nah! Nigerians, reason!

I am on the verge of throwing every single one of you off this green earth...

So I can reside here alone.

I cannot can beyond how far I have can with Nigerians.

You are a peculiar people, oloun!

I am really sorry for anyone who takes Nigerians seriously.

Whew!
.

Anyway... we move!
