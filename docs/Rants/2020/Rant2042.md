People have asked me, "What's the difference between a Feminist and a Rebellious Woman."

Henceforth, I'll drop clues as answers.

Here are a few:

1. A feminist goes to church and listens to a pastor, who is most certainly a misogynist, and she sieves the message - takes the part that suits the feminist agenda and throws the rest in a bin.

A rebellious woman doesn't go to church.
.

2. A feminist reads the bible and is ready to defend parts of it that are kind to her gender, but continues bashing Paul for his misogyny - which happens to be half of the new testament ðŸ˜‚
.

Religion, for women, is like walking through a minefield. The unseen hazards make you believe you are safe... but it takes one second for an explosion to happen and tear your personhood into shards of indignity.

Rebellious women do not rely on these religious books to speak to their personhood.
.

3. A feminist will hold a conversation with a sexist neighbour and try to change his mind...

Sometimes they speak for so long, they create a bond and, well, become chummy whilst he continues thinking about giving up parts of his patriarchal privileges or nah.

A rebellious woman will not talk to a misogynist neighbour at all.
.

4. A feminist still has pick-mes and co in her comment section, talmbout "I want to give the whole world an opportunity to express themselves so I can correct them."

A rebellious woman will not condone any confident or struggling pick-me voice in her space. She will block yo ass.
.

5. A feminist is an advocate, a believer. She may believe a grown-ass misogynist may change and is willing to give him the benefit of doubt by, well, building affection with him, dating him and believing in him.

A rebellious woman will not touch that niggaa with a ten-foot pole. Get lost, abeg!
.

Know the difference, plis.

Thanks.
