I don't defend Jesus. 

I don't defend Oprah.

I don't defend Mary Njoku.

I don't defend Chimamanda Adichie.
.

I don't defend greatness.

Greatness defends itself.
.
.

I mean, look at your shoes.

You, with a mocking opinion, look. at. your. shoes.

Bend your head and look at 'em shoes.

Let's start from there.

Your shoes, I am very certain, are shit.

I won't go farther than the shoes you have on to determine if I'll exchange e-words with you.

God forbid.

Let's stick with shoes...

Because if I look at the work you do - the shitty production you make, yet you have the effrontery to criticise someone who will buy your entire generation and have enough change to buy your generation all over again...

I might actually spit on you.

Joker.
.
.

Look at the work of your critics before you listen to what they have to say about anything they have to say about you or the people you admire.

Look at the mess they produce.

Joker raised to the power of ode.
.
.

Shake your head. Walk away. And continue aligning yourself with greatness.
.

I will never defend greatness.

Great people will be fine.

Defending greatness weakens its vibranium.
.

You yab Chimamanda, she receives another honorary doctorate.

You talk shit about the Njokus, Mary goes on to launch ROK 1, 2 and 3, and goes on SKY!

YOU, have you eaten?

*mscheeeeew!
.

Greatness is its own alibi.

Great people will be fine.

But YOU... look at your damn shoes!

Toh!
