UNPOPULAR OPINION
.
.

"My own time will come..."

Is usually born out of insecurity and bitterness.

Because it usually comes after you witness the progress of someone else.
.

Your time may not come.

People live and die and may never see this "time" they talk about.
.

And what really is "your time"?

When you buy a Benz? When you build a house? When you marry Prince Harry? When you travel to Spain?

What is "my time will come"?

What does it mean in the Nigerian pepperdem context?
.

One time, I was buying my full range of Clarins and the lady who escorted me to the beauty store just blurted after I had paid...

"Ah! I must make am for this life. My time will come."

I don't understand shit like that. It smacks of inferiority complex.

Are you saying your time will come when you can finally moisturise your skin? I don't get! 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
.

Sometimes this time that will come is a performance they believe will make the next person afraid or cautious.

More like... "treat me well o! Buy for me now o! Because my time will come."

You know, the silly Nigerian threats.

People should treat you well even if your time will not come. 

But YOU, how do you treat people you perceive their time has come? Are you not walking around like a bag of poor self esteem, polluting the place with your lack that you wear like a privilege and expect everyone to twist themselves for your benefit... because your time has not come?

Your time has probably come a hundred times but you are not discerning. So shush with your mild threats. Don't annoy me!
.

"My time will come and I will SHOW you! Finally, I will have something in my life and you will see! You will see how I will be great nyen nyen nyen." 

That is the connotation and undertone of this nonsense.

Be great already! We are tired of waiting.

Be great so you can shut up and stop jumping around posts talmbout how all of you will be great together to pepper the rest of the world.

They talk as if the person who is already "great" will be stagnant while they the "un-great" ones are processing their greatness.

It is daft. I am tried of being around people like that.

It is jealousy. Jealousy shrouded in anger for self. 

And it is dangerous.
.
.

What is this so-called "greatness" sef that you aspire to that is making you deluded?

This greatness that is about to happen to you that you think will stop oxygen in other people's lives... What is it?

You will finally earn thrice your salary, abi? Or something like that.

Ask yourself what the person, whose life is making you lose your composure, is currently worth.

My point is: your greatness, when it finally comes, may still look like mediocre achievement to those who are familiar with success.

And because it is all to pepper others, it will still not meet the expectations of greatness.

You're sad. But please, don't be this sad.

Greatness starts by working on the flaws that are obvious, not the delusional ideas you have in your head.

Those ideas may never happen.

Then what will you do? Make more excuses?

Pff.
.
.

Do you know what greatness looks to me?

Greatness is Itodo Samuel Anthony.

That is greatness to me.

His life. His commitment to teaching. What he does for the students in the school he teaches. The places his profession has taken him to - from villages to first world cities.

That is greatness.

Period

But some of you are here thinking you can pepper us when you finally earn N350k and be able to afford a Sonata.

Please let us hear word and stop threatening us with "greatness" we have already surmounted.
