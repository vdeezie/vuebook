I remember when I had to move out of my apartment in Festac.

I was already staying in Lekki, but my rent in Festac hadn't expired, so I had a three-bedroom with no one living there for eight months.

When it was time to move my stuff out, I made sure not to be anywhere near the location. I hate packing 😂

I'm talking sofas, electronics, beds, gas cooker, fridge, air conditioners, microwave, internet modem, washing machine -  the whole shebang.

Thankfully I sold everything online, right here on Facebook before D-day.

Roberta was there to transact the business with my buyers. Monies were paid, appliances and furniture were moved out.

Then she had to pack all my other personal effects to a warehouse we paid for at Yaba.

I told her to take anything she wanted, then move the rest to the warehouse.

My mum heard I was giving all my stuff to Roberta, so she drove to my apartment to see what she could get - plates, pans, pots, shoes, jewellery, perfumes, bedsheets, mattresses, clothes, bags - everything!

I didn't even want to think about it. They can have it all.

Roberta went with a friend. Pack till you drop! 😂

I was spending that weekend in a hotel alone. The Boyfriend was somewhere in Europe for a conference meeting.

I told Roberta to call only when she was done packing.

By evening, she was done. Then I went to bed.

The next time I'd see her, I kept saying...

"That's my shoe! That's my bag! That's my bracelet! That's my wig!"

😂😂😂

Oh! I gave her all my premium wigs too. Made from expensive AF hair. I had way too many wigs. It was insane.

Well, as long as it was Roberta, she could have my ATM card too!

Oh! That's true! She did have my ATM card. Roberta was the one who withdrew my money when I needed it. She knew my passwords to every single account.

I trust her and love her like a sister.

I'm glad she never made me question my decision.

One day, The Boyfriend and I visited her new place of work. When she was walking towards us, he chuckled and said.

"Here comes Joy's creation in the flesh."

We laughed 😂

I'm so proud of her.
.

I hope y'all still buy Nzuri? You made me alot of money with Nzuri. Biko, do it for my girl too. 

Product still the same quality. She's also coming out with new products.

It's all hers now.

Patronise her the way you patronised me.

.

When she decided to own Nzuri, I told her she can make use of my warehouse for her business.

Crazy thing is, I haven't been to the warehouse I paid for. And another rent is due 😂

It's all good. As long as it's Roberta, I'm cool. She is my sister now 🥰

PS: This was us on our way to Accra last year.

From employee to business partner to friend to sister.

This is to sisterhood that continues to prove its worth.

Bless ❤
