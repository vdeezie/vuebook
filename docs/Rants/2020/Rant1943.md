I have a beauty night routine.

It's always amusing when I'm actively dating and the man thinks I'm doing my beauty routine for his benefit.

I can confidently say that in the last five years, there's nothing I do for the benefit of a man.

Nothing.

I am arrogant enough to believe that I am the prize. Even on the days I show up with a belly full of amala and a waist as wide as that bowl Iya Risika uses to fry akara.

I am still the prize when you yank off my wig and find scattered hair.

I am the prize when I take off my make up.

Still the prize when I lie flat on the bed and open leg and let you do all the work.

Prize on good days and on lazy days.

Prize.

OK. So where was I?

Yes! Beauty routine.

Ehen! So I have a beauty routine after I shower at night...

For my face, I cleanse with Clarins alcohol-free lotion with iris. Followed by Clarins double serum - hydric and lipidic system. Then Clarins night cream.

For the rest of the body, I use Clarins extra-firming lotion. And sometimes Nivea Q10 firming lotion.

It's a ritual. And I enjoy it more when I am alone.

I also use body spray at night after shower.

But when you are with a man... niggaa starts to think you are doing it for him.

And that's why niggaaz say stuff like...

"Oh! You are pretty the way you are, come to bed."

Or

"Are we going out? You are really going to bed looking picture perfect?"

🙄🙄🙄

Skincare routine works better at night. Duh!

When you apply your beauty products during the day, you also apply makeup, and then you have to head out into the sun. Daytime hustle interferes with the results you need to see.

At night, your skin responds better to the routine because nothing interferes with the process - no sun, no makeup.

The skin absorbs the beauty treatment, and you see the results.

However, the problem in Nigeria is electricity.

There's no light to provide the comfort you need for this level of necessary vanity. When you apply cream or pamper your skin in the heat, you'll want to tear your skin out afterwards. 

However, I've not had to worry about that for a few years now, as I have been guaranteed at least 22-hour electricity since then - from living in a hotel, to living in those pretentious Lekki apartment buildings that provide all-night electricity, to moving to Accra where the light never goes out.

So when I do my night routine. I do it for me.

I even try to tone down when I'm with a man, because niggaaz don't get it.

The Boyfriend gets it though.

The one that is sweeting him now is this my low-cut.

His hand is always on my head - a part of my body he was forbidden to touch when I wore wigs or had curls.

And he has been proposing sex in the shower because now we can both get wet from head to toe 😂😂

I miss him. I haven't seen him this year.

I haven't had sex this year.

I'm not trying monogamy, I'm just not interested in anyone right now except him.

And I think it will remain this way for a long time.

Hian! How did I manage to talk about three different themes in one rant! 😂😁🥰#Rant1943
