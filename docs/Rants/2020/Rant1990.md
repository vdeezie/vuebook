This is why I hate small money.

I HATE small money.

The stress small money gives is never worth it.

Never!
.

I write scripts and nobody stresses me.

They fly me around for script conferences.

No stress.

They pay well.

And pay on time.

And give me more script/creative jobs that pay well.
.
.

But then you decide to open your page for Ads after years of resisting.

Chicken fvcking money.

Yet you will spend the entire day mediating between business owner and client...

And people having the effrontery to act proud after bad service.
.

I am so done with small money.

So done.
.
.

My scriptwriting retreat is N50k per person.

In just a week, after a post, 10 people paid.

That's my target.

Ten participants.

Easy.
.
.

But you see all this N5k, N10k, N20k business transactions....

The shit that comes with it...

The entitlement....

The "is it not my money" garbage that follows it...

I hate it.

I never want to be part of small money conversations.

Please go away.
.

If you do small money business...

Do NOT talk to me, buzz me, or call my name.

Ever again!
