Not to alarm anyone, but in all of the coronaviru.s situation...

There's still cancer, diabetes, hypertension, lupus, leukaemia, heart disease, liver diseases, kidney disease, HIV, pneumonia, tuberculosis, Typhoid, stroke et al.

How are these people/patients coping at a time like this?
.

If someone is rolling on the floor at home, right this minute, seeking medical attention and diagnosis to know what the problem is...

It wouldn't be priority, yet some situations require only a minute response, else the person dies.

Glaucoma patients, for instance, need their eyedrops, else they go blind. But most optometrist centres are closed. How are these patients coping?

Doctor's appointment for diseases that are monitored closely... the world cannot afford to give those patients any attention right now.

Patients booked for surgery - you know, things like that.

This virus that threatens to consume the world has humbled every other disease even more deadly.

How is this not the end of the world, pray tell?
