Some kids will remember their mothers cooking in the kitchen and howling at anyone close by to "bring that Maggi inside fridge!"

Others will remember their mothers slaying in iro and buba, attending wedding parties.

My daughters, however, will remember their mother chilling on the couch, laptop on my lap, Amarula in my glass, writing or mimicking different character voices as I read out the scripts I write.

All of these types of mothers are valid, by the way. 
.

However, today I decided to make stew and rice from scratch. 

My girls have been walking in and out of the kitchen, taking a cup of yoghurt, an apple, or coconut chips. Invading my culinary moment.

"Are you bored?" They asked.

"No. Why do you ask?"

"You've been in the kitchen longer than usual."

If I'm not curled on the couch, writing or reading out dialogues I create... then something must be wrong.
