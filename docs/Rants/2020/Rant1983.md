Today, I met the kindest Uber driver.

I was at Ikota Villa and couldn't provide any landmark for him to locate me. 

The map was leading him to the wrong road. We kept at it for over 15 minutes, yet this man did not lose his patience, he did not get irritated, he did not snap at me.

He was kind, he was patient... and I was clueless on how best to help myself locate myself. LOL! There were no clear landmarks.

At some point, he said he may need to cancel the request. That was after 15 minutes of trying. But he asked one more time...

"Are you sure there's no landmark anywhere? Even a tree?"

😂😂😂

At that moment I found a tree - just kidding... Lol!!!

I found a nursery school... and he tracked me to that point.

I apologised profusely, he smiled "It is not your fault. There were no clues available."
.

I told him I needed to get food at Mega Chicken... and I asked if he wanted something.

I was going to buy him the entire restaurant! Walahi! 😂😂😂

Kindness is a beautiful thing.

Gratitude is good.

Reciprocation (of kindness) is gold.
.

I experience kindness on a daily for it to be a coincidence.

I think the universe is trying to teach me something.

I think the universe is trying to teach me Kindness.

I understand gratitude and I am the queen of kind reciprocation

I NEVER let a kind gesture go unrewarded. Never.

But kindness is a virtue I am yet to fully embrace.

Because people are mad.

So there!

But for always showing me only the kind side of every situation and letting my path lead to kind people... I believe God wants me to act more on kindness.
