I hated family members giving me any kind of advice when I was younger.

It always came across as if I should be grateful I wasn't the girl selling agoin beans by the corner of the street.

They gave advice to ensure I was humbled. 

And I hated it.

At no time did I take their advice.

Why should I ever be grateful I am not the girl selling agoin beans, for gods sake?

My father is rich. My mother is very comfortable. I had a good foundation in education. I have my own strong will.

So why would anyone think trying to keep me in fear or instil a sense of subservience in me was the right approach to talking to me?

I hated it!

And it was always with such great pleasure that I flouted their orders.

They were always complaining. Always. 

You would think I was a problem child.

Ah! Na wa!

And I was a good girl o!

I did not smoke, I did not drink, I did not fornicate, I did not keep friends or go to parties. 

I was always alone, talking to myself.

I washed clothes, ironed clothes (as best as I could), I washed car, I fetched water from the well, I cooked.

Good kid!

What the fuck else did they want from a teenager?

Nonsense!
.

Y'all have no idea how glorious it is to be a fully fledged rebel now.

Sometimes, I smile to myself...

The irony of it all.

The kind of woman they feared I could be, was exactly what I became...

A woman seen. A woman heard.

I love to see it.
