You can title this: Aunty Joy will not let young people enjoy their lives.

*
We know what happens when a woman and a man are locked in a house for 90 days. There'll be sex, lies, sucking and licking; moaning and laughing.

We know people will get horny if all they have to do is wake up and stare into the faces of other humans without any purpose beyond scheming to win some money.

We know there'll be backbiting, betrayal, compromise, sacrifice.

There'll be drunken behaviour and self- righteous fibs.

We know all the shit that is possible when adults have no ambition for 90 days.

We know!

And this is what makes Big Brother Africa/Nigeria unnecessary.

What we don't know is what talents Nigerians can explore in other situations beyond entertainment. 

Can Cocoice produce salt to compete with the monopoly if introduced to the business of manufacturing? 
Can Tboss become a tech guru and set up another Andela that supports an industry of the future? 
Can Gifty become a modern agriculturist inspiring subsistence farming and promoting an industry largely ignored?

Who else?

Can Tiny Tall Tony manufacture ankara locally?

Can they vie for money to give into an industry that can save millions of Nigerians and promote nascent and/or ignored aspects of our development?

Things like that. Real issues. Important third world solutions. 

This defence of #BBNaija as an entertainment show where poor Africans enjoy fornication... where one of them comes out richer... and his richness profits only his/her wardrobe and family "sufferation" and personal bubble is what first world countries can waste time doing. Not Nigeria.

Do you know what $100,000 can do for a fledgling industry in technology, agriculture, local production in this deadbeat country?

We don't have well-sponsored reality shows on these subjects. It's as if we conspire with South Africa and the rest of the world to keep us poor.

#BBNaija gives ONE individual the opportunity to buy nicer clothes, buy a bungalow on the mainland, a nice car for your mum, hold cool parties at Quilox, date a prettier chick/dude, fly business class to New York... and money to start your pet project in music and acting. O tan.

It's just a game, you say. I don hear.

A show anticipating debauchery every milli-second is not the game we should be playing when our universities don't have water, toilets or decent classrooms.

In Ikorodu, little children receive education sitting on the floor in 2017!
LUTH maternity wards have no pram or mosquito nets. 

We need to think of Nigeria's woes holistically.

A child doesn't deserve video games when he fails his exams.

Nigeria doesn't require reality shows when we cannot cure malaria from within our structures. 

Look around your country; start from where you are- your local government, public hospitals, public schools. Think about our ambition to produce pencils in 2018. Turn to the base of your toothpick and wail over the fact that something so basic is produced in Germany and imported to 180million clueless people occupying a dark hot space.

Our future is unprepared.

Think about Nigeria holistically.
