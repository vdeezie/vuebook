You know, we all can come up with cool stories that we can attribute to participating in a challenge or paying tithes. And that's OK. I think human beings are entitled to creating their idyll imagination. 

But I got tired of that. Because something deeper than money happened to me:

I stopped being Afraid.

I stopped being afraid of all the tragic things and prophecies the pastor whose church I attended as a spiritual neophyte crept into my spirit. 

I stopped being afraid that I would fall sick, I would die suddenly, I will be poorly paid at work etc. 

I was so tired of fear that I didn't care anymore.

I stopped being afraid of death. Because even Christians who tithe die miserably or suddenly in plane crashes and on the roads and on sick beds, yet their tithe didn't come to their rescue.

Why?

Because tithing is not what gives you abundance. And the consequences of not tithing does not end your life.

You must understand this. Maybe not, I don't care.

There's no safe proof to living on this earth. 

My biggest victory is losing my fear, especially of Death and Poverty. That was when I began to prosper.

Many atheists prosper. Prosperity follows principles and laws that anybody can apply. If you are dumb and you tithe, you are still going to be poor.

It is KNOWLEDGE that sets you free. But Nigerians are not big on that. They want to be spoonfed. And the tragedy of being spoonfed is that you don't get to choose what you eat. You are not in control of the decisions you make. They tell you that you have a right not to tithe, but there's always that clause that feeds your fear... that clause that says: if you like don't tithe, we are not forcing you but when disaster comes, don't come to us and weep. Know that your zero tithing caused it.

That clause is made to keep you afraid. And God hates fear. Because fear stands as a wall between you and Him. So the only God you have when you live constantly in fear is your Pastor. 

The Nigeria church is buttered with fear and unnecessary angst. 

Why?

Because Daddyfreeze.

Lol!

I mean, think about it: all the "rich" pastors and their sheep are coming at ONE man because HE QUESTIONS YOUR PRINCIPLES FROM THE BIBLE. 

He has been called a Godhater, churchhater, pastorhater. Why?

Because he questions tithing. Not the love of God. Not the qualities of the holy spirit. Not the principles of Jesus Christ...

The only thing he invests his time questioning is tithing. This directly impacts livelihoods- expensive livelihoods. So the beneficiaries of tithing are angry that ONE man is trying to drag the chicken from their mouths.

Can you not see how pathetic this is? How incredible idiotic?

Question: Does the Nigerian church think they are above scrutiny and judgment from people? How is it that all these pastors are jumping out of their SUVs and privates jets to silence ONE man?

Answer: Fear. 

Fear pretentiously presented as holy anger. 

I cannot respect any pastor that takes his time to accuse Freeze of being anti-God. I can't.

This is not what God sent you.

I strongly believe that even if Jesus was here, He wouldn't support you too.

By the way,  I think the entire, err, "Leader of the free world" title is quite narcissistic and I want nothing with it. But like I said at some point, Freeze isn't perfect. But for questioning tithe and constantly showing how it doesn't tie to your success or happiness, he has done a good thing in a country full of very daft people.

I stopped paying tithe long time ago. I stopped being afraid. And I dared God:

I love you God. And if you want to tell me that the only way I can truly be considered your child is by paying tithe to a church, then do whatever you want to do.

Everyday I wake up and I tell God: Today I am ready to meet you.

I am always ready.

So He decided to bless me instead.

Nothing beats 2017. Nothing.

And 2018 is even going to be greater.

Signed,
Non-tithing Christian.
