Someone will just decide to call you a pawn or any inferior character on a chessboard. And you, with your brain intact, would give that vile creature a chance in hell for a response.

I can’t understand it. These people are trolls. It’s the internet. It’s delusional. Can’t you see?

They need your name in their mouths to be able to survive the misery they call life. Hating you is the only good thing that has happened to them. They need to constantly write long-ass shit about you to feel any real sense of value. They need to tag you to a pile of mess, hoping by dragging you in, you can turn that mess to diamonds. They need you for air. For tips. For kicks.They can't win any other way.

And you pay attention to these losers. How?

Our sense of discernment is so poor. PEOPLE ARE TRANSPARENT.

If you don’t know how to read people, go and learn! It’s disgraceful the number of times you fall into silly situations with people parading lightweight brains.

If you read half the mess they post you can tell if they have a job, if they live in a house or squatting with a guardian, if they have N15k left in an account. You can tell what they think about women, men, children. Heck, you can tell if a man is beating the shit out of their senses or if they are emotionally abused by their constant exoneration of men. We are not exactly cream material for intelligence. The average Nigerian is thanking God for the car he bought with the money he stole. Nigerians call on God when they have anal sex with a married man, and they troll the wife with “my God will fight for me.”

We are sick people. When you understand that, everything else is easy to deal with from this side of the earth.

The items required to be active on social media are: 
A phone. 
Data (as cheap as N1k)
And a lot of time on your hands.
That’s all.

99% of the trolls do not have the tinniest clue how to use social media to their benefit. Yet, they describe you as a pawn, and you let it get to you?

The best lives many people are living is the life with the most mundane pursuits. On the internet they become authorities on how people should live, who should be great, who shouldn’t be. Who should be crowned social media queens and kings. And people drop comments because they are lice, at best.

Every single time someone will rise from the dead and ask the most idiotic question made from troll ville: “Who inspire you the most on Facebbook.” There you will find people fighting over who should be mentioned and who shouldn’t be.

“Put A. Comot B. C nor be am. I nor like D. Ah! E na correct. F is the greatest of them all. I so much like X.”

And then the “thank you for calling my name” replies. “Thank you for tagging me as the greatest on Facebook”. “I am privileged” yada yugu.

Kill me now.

You people are not well.

This shit doesn’t mean anything! Whether they are on your side or not… this shit is empty paper. 

We are back to high school. We are saving the glorious positions of life for our “friends”, the ones we yap with on social media. But you see, life doesn’t work that way. Your “friends” don’t get to be great just because you like them.

Greatness doesn’t discriminate. Thank God for that. It will happen to the most unlikely persons, because there are principles to these things, and your "awesome friends" are clueless nitwits. Sorry.

You don’t get to be a pawn just because someone with a bad job and bad dreams who don’t like you say so.

You don’t fail because you are not chummy. You fail because you don’t keep to the principles to success.

These trolls are average as fuck. Can’t you see?

They can’t foot any bill beyond a three square meal. That in itself isn’t a problem. Be average without the burden of hallucination.

The first rule to social media is to learn how to use deliberate negative triggers to your benefit. If you don’t know how, you are wasting your life. And you shouldn’t be here.
