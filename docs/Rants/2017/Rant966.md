An acquaintance was accused of sleeping with a married man, but she didn’t, I was certain of that, because I casually followed through with that story from the beginning. But I am not one to think highly of Nigerian marriages, so it was water off my back as a “witness” to the situation. I was bored, and I wanted to tell all the adults involved in this mess to fuck off. Which I did, actually, in the acquaintance's sitting room, where the married woman of the married man was trying to drill a hole of guilt into the woman being accused. I’d had enough after 30 minutes, so I told her to fuck off, to the astonishment of the “mourning wife”, who wanted so desperately to be a victim, to wear that cloak– that cloak that suggests that another woman had hurt her well-laid foundation called Marriage.

Yawn.

Let me tell the story:

The acquaintance (Let’s call her Bird) had a nice boutique in town. I like clothes, so I was always around the store buying stuff. Her house is the next building, so after becoming her most cherished customer, she would invite me for cakes and drinks after a purchase. I’ll shrug and accept the offer. She isn’t really my type for friendship, but she was a good woman - kind, straight with business and all. Sometimes she’d leave a gift in the store because she knew I’d pop in. We were, in some ways, indebted to each other.

One day, trying to fit into a pair of jeans I wanted to buy at her store, she told me a friend’s husband has been trying to be with her.

As a matter of fact, the man is also her friend. She is friends with both husband and wife; which in my experience is such a fucked-up thing. 

The man has been trying in every means to sleep with her. He sends her WhatsApp messages (every sexual crime is committed on WhatsApp, by the way); he also sent a dick pix.

The only question I asked was: have you told the wife?

She said “No”.

“Tell the wife,” I said.

I don’t like secrets. When it comes to Nigerian couples, secrets will come back and jab you in the ass. I don’t have time to be protecting a partner warming up to cheat. Not like I really give a damn if half of a Nigerian Siamese cheats, I just don’t care really. As marriage dey do una, e nor do me like dat.

She left her mouth open and said, “Are you serious? Why should I tell the wife? I don’t want trouble.”

I laughed, “Oh, but trouble will come whether you tell or not.”

It’s a Nigerian marriage thing. It’s us against the world – even if your spouse is a lousy ass.

“I don’t want to break up a home,” she cried.

She was clearly getting on my nerves. “Break up a home, how? Who told you the wife will leave because he wants to fuck you?”

She decided not to take my advice. She kept quiet and convinced herself that the man would eventually get tired and stop. Crazy thing is, the couple comes to her home frequently. The wife is always bored, so she visits every other day, and the husband picks her up from Bird’s house after work. So sometimes, Bird invites him in for cakes and drinks.

I’ve met them a few times.

One year later, the man, frustrated and angry at Bird for constantly turning him down, LIES to his wife that Bird has been trying to sleep with him. Di man wear di shirt inside out, as dem go talk for pidgin.

He even produces messages… but I know that kind for message – it is the message women send when they are trying to buzz you off without being rude. 

There are conversations where he’d type:
“Hey baby.”
And Bird would respond with: “LOL!”

You know that kind of mess? Yes. He had a pile of evidence for his wife. He had become a very bitter man, and he wanted to end the friendship, so Bird had to look bad for him to ever get his wife to close that friendship. And that’s what he did.

Trust Naija wife, she was LIVID!!!

She spat and screamed, and made a scene at Bird's shop.

Bird called me to defend her. I came for the entertainment… and some cake.

So Bird was crying, trying to tell her friend that it isn’t true… she made the blunder of saying the husband was the one who, in the last one year, has been trying to sleep with her. 

Bad move, Bird. Not at this hour. Too late. I told you to tell this wife a year ago. The friendship would have ended then, but at least nobody will be up in your face accusing you of shit!

At this point, the couple had the upper-hand. They won this debate. So Bird is officially known as “husband snatcher”.

Why?

Because Birdie will not spill the shittiness of a Nigerian marriage.
Married couples are the absolute worst! It’s your word against a husband or wife, and you will never win. Never! Extricate yourself from their mess, let them carry their friendship and go!

Personally, I feel uncomfortable being friends with a husband and his wife. I pick one person in the charade, and keep a distance from the other.

It's commonsense. They protect what is theirs, YOU protect yourself.

I only just remembered this because another acquaintance is asking for advice for something similar.

And I have told her in plain English: TELL THE OTHER SPOUSE!

Then throw a party for losing their friendship. They ain’t all that.
