Today, I told my daughters about the three year old boy accused of being a witch and left to die in this country, rescued by a Danish woman, Anja Ringgren Loven.

I told them about police complacency and lack of everything, including common sense and basic empathy, to protect the citizens. 

I shared the story of Nigerian schools with no toilets, no learning facilities, hostels like rat hole, lecturers demanding money and sex with no consequences... from Great OAU to pedestrian LASPOTECH, same story.

I talked about politicians and how they have raped and ravaged the country. I told them of millions of dollars stashed in abandoned Ikoyi homes. 

I talked about pastors, fraudsters and dishonesty in the name of a god they neither know, care about nor truly worship.  

I told them about rape, the role of society and how victims are shamed. And the poor, nonchalant system that makes it tough for victims to get justice.

I talked about poverty in Nigeria and how The Poor have no hope. 

I shared the story of Zamfara shame: of meningitis vaccines missing/stolen in a state where hundred of deaths have been recorded. 

I talked and talked and cried (especially after sharing Hope's story, the little boy accused of witchcraft, and how he was left to ROAM THE STREETS NAKED)

What kind of society is this???

Sigh. 

So I said to my daughters: 

"I will get you out of this country when it's time for tertiary education. I will try my best. You deserve so much more. Nigeria can't give you a quarter of the decency you are entitled to as a human being... But if I fail, get ready. You must fight every nonsense society tells you, and you must rise above 'em all."

It's going to be OK.
