You see, this Jolade who is shining anyhow academically wasn't exactly the brightest kid in school years ago.

It got bad that, in primary one, I was advised she should go for a Nursery 3 class. 

I don't know if there's anything I despise academically as much as I despise "Nursery 3". I can't stand to hear anyone even mention it. So I said no and they informed me that she wasn't so smart for Primary One yet.

That didn't bother me at all. As a matter of fact, there was never a time I told her what they said.

That was the last year Jolade ever had a problem with her academics. She's been an A student in the last 6 years. Not just any random A student, but the brightest of the bunch. Top 3 sensation.

What did I do?

Nothing. As in, absolutely none of the things parents would normally do. I didn't enrol her in any private/home lesson to, err, catch up. I didn't scold her. I didn't panic.
I didn't go through her books. Actually, I've never done that. It's crazy, isn't it? I don't look through their notebooks because I get agitated when I see a lot of cancelling and I don't like being agitated if I can help it. 99% of the time I resist agitation, except bad weather. I don't even monitor their home work. 

What I did was introduce novels into her life. That's what I monitor. I bought packs and packs of fiction and introduced her to an exciting new world of many possibilities where children fly, literally; where everything is achievable through good literature.

Then I tell her everyday how incredibly smart and beautiful she is. Not in a patronizing way. I make her understand she can make smart decisions all on her own without me getting in her way and if she needs advice I'll always be here. 

And I let her breathe. I let her be. I let her be a child who is getting a hang on this academic thing, albeit slowly. 

Not at anytime during that entire phase of her life, getting to be confident academically, did I as much as mention that she was lagging behind in class.

For me it wasn't even an issue. At all. Because I decided that organised education will NEVER determine my children's future.

Of course, it feels good to have them spoil me with first and second position every term. It justifies money spent and great for all our egos.

Only recently did we chat about her struggles in Primary One. And we laughed. Even she can't remember ever being "dull". 

Now she's reading Anne Frank 'The Diary of a Young Girl'. Probably the 202nd book/novel she's read since she was 5. A gift from my precious friend, Teetee.

In my home, I don't sweat the small stuff. 

For instance, Ife can't find one of her school shirts. This chick just came second in her class in a new school. Surely I am not going to ruin her Christmas because of a shirt she misplaced (even though uinforms are quite expensive. Sigh). It's awfully careless to misplace your new school shirt, but hey, she did good in other ways.

Let her be.

As far as I was concerned, trying to demote my Jolade to a Nursery 3 so she can "catch up" was the small stuff. I didn't sweat it. I found another world, much better than her reality; I introduced it to her, and I allowed her grow wings to fly.

We laugh about it now. And everytime she gets to look in my eyes, she says, "Thank you, mummy."

❤❤❤

PS: I always read the posts dedicated to them. I like to see them blush. Lol!
