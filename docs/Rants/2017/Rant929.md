# Rant929



August 7, 2017

Nigerians will add you to a WhatsApp Group titled, "High Energy Astrophysics" yet the only thing they'd share on a regular basis would be clickbaits about "9 Ways to keep your man", "What Jesus said to Moses on his way to a roof", and some of the most idiotic memes that call into question the thing in their skull; could it be a brain or mashed potatoes?

It is why I ignore all invitation to WhatsApp groups. It's too silly to even imagine. They wake you up with "Good morning. God bless your day" with many ridiculous memes illustrating what they already wrote.

We don't have a "great day" because a group of people on the internet wish us so. We have a great day by creating it. Everything in life is deliberate. 

With the amount of "love" some of you nurture online, walking on eggshells just so you are cyber-favoured by a group of other users of the same technology, one would think you can trade that shit for a Linda Ikeji Banana Island kind of mansion. But you are still (below) average. Because people's wishes for you mean very little. 

How hard can this be to understand? 

A few days back, the chairman of my close added me to the WhatsApp group created for all tenants to discuss "important issues". Of course I knew "important issues" would be the last thing they ever get to discuss, so I gave a fake number the first month I came. Four months later, they are at my gate demanding my WhatsApp number. Grudgingly I give it out, now I get tons of messages to remind us to "have a good day", "don't eat wheat", "boil your eggs until the yoke sings", "the only way to praise Jehova", "story of the beggar and the rich man and why riches is not everything"... plus political jokes and celebrity shit. 

These are MEN with children and wives. Family men! Yet conversation rotates around hearsay.

If I go there now and drop one small Rant, they'll start to tear their beards out like some of you on Facebook. 

I am tempted to make their lives miserable. I shall drop one Rant, and watch their poor self esteem crawl out of their skin like worms from a dog's anus. 

Yet we wonder why we have zero capacity to engage or develop in this dark and primitive country.

Shior!
