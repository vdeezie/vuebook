Ife says: Mummy, have you noticed that almost all Nigerian songs are talking about a woman...

Me: And how they want to sleep with her.

Ife: Exactly.

Me: You know what they mean when they sing about Cassava, right?

Ife: Yes.

Me: They are referring to the penis. 

Ife: And they talk about Tomato.

Me: That's a term for vagina, I think.

Ife: They are dull.

Me: They call it entertainment. It's just tiring.

Ife: It's as if all they want to do is fall in love.

Me: It's not love. It's sex and lust.

Jolly: What's lust?

Me: That's when you want to be with someone strictly for physical pleasure; just for his/her body.

Ife: Hmm. Na wa.

Jolly shaking her head by the corner, feeling just as tired of the 21st century commercial lyrics.
