There is nothing quite as heartbreaking as being with a man who mocks your dreams, finds joy in your humiliation, and tells you in clear terms, "You ain't shit. Don't try to act like you are special. Why do you think it has to be you to do great things"...

And all other forms of abasement. 

I will never forgive a man who belittles even my craziest ambitions. 

If I say I want to hold the largest forum in the whole of Africa, for instance...

If you laugh and scorn, just know it's over. We will never recover from that. 

Nothing is as final as that moment when you belittle my dreams. 

Give me good reasons why it may not succeed, from a point of concern and love... but if you mock my ambitions, it's over.

Leave me to fail. Let me fail. It is my right to succeed and/or fail. Don't take that right away from me. Don't teach me how to be average and normal. Don't make me a woman who lives with care and zero risks.

I don't want to be that woman.

Let me fail. Then hug me and allow me cry on your chest.

Unless my failure will cost you money... hopefully it wouldn't. Then it will remain my business, and your place is to respect my business.

But to stop me from doing that which I want to by mocking me in advance... is the most idiotic act of an insecure partner.

Tell me "Babe, you are adding weight oh." And I can get back on the thread mill. 

But when you say, "Hahaha! Look at you! What do you think you are? You are going to lose"... at something you have never done yourself...

I don't waste time on shit. It's goodbye, Sugar.

Buchi's time was different, but I sincerely don't know how modern (wo)men live with constant verbal/emotional abuse. 

So after s/he tells you (that) you ain't shit... you still get to fuck? What's sex really about? Is it not an appreciation of every cell and goal, thought, ambition, qualities and flaws of an individual?

You are hanging around and/or sleeping with someone who doesn't even believe you are exceptional.

Ask yourself, "what's the point?"
