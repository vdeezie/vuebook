We are defined, in some ways, by tribe. Tribe is a sensitive subject. When we throw in common practices and traditions of a people in our judgments, there’s room for the 10% - 30% to roar in disagreement. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that the (in)formal rules of behavior and cultural mores by members of a particular tribe define who they are, what they admit to be conventional, and the lifestyle that appeals to them.

In all my years, I have never heard of a Yoruba man who had to “train” or “groom” a 15 year old girl in school for the sake of marriage.

I do not believe Yoruba people promote a tradition that make brides out of teenage girls OR products for marriage. 

I am sure there are stories like that in the nooks and crannies of a tribe exploding in the millions scattered all over Nigeria and across Africa and overseas, but I am yet to find that Yoruba mechanic sponsoring a minor in school just for the purpose of marriage.

No. The mechanic marries the bread seller and life carries on.

However, as young as 13, I have heard many stories of the two other major tribes sprucing up girls, some as young as 16, to become wives.

In the North, there’s the pretty 14 year old Hauwa who didn’t show up for SS1 because her family married her off to a 57 year old man. 

In the East, there are many stories of men – from spare part dealers to educated men abroad who take on the role as breadwinners for a family just so they can nurture one of their (young) daughters for marriage.

In a poor society like ours, this is encouraged. We do not frown at the idea of men buying love from impressionable girls and their poor families. It is a trade – his money for her affection, and her family's respect. 

If we are addressing adults in this context, then it’s fine. One adult can decide to buy the attention and affection of another adult. There are women “borrowing” cyber boyfriends money for, err, career advancement. And there are brothers wow-ing the women of their affection with things real money can buy.

By all means, carry on. This is your legit stories.
But these stories are unlike the chronicles of the tribes that see no problem in preparing young girls for marriage.

It is the same yarn spun from how-my-mother-married-at-16-in-1946 to how-I-need-to-get-an-innocent-wife-from-secondary-school-in-2017… how does that your mother’s dream fit into modern realities? With all the development of our world, why would anyone drag a tired unproductive tradition from the backwaters of stagnation to the ever evolving present?

Will the world collapse if we review these cultural, albeit informal, laws?

How does a 27 year old man cite his mother’s grooming that happened before River Niger bridge was conceived as the inspiration to carry on the tradition of carefully observing teenage girls for signs of naivety and hunger as bait for love and marriage?

These are things I am yet to find in “Yorubaland”, to be honest.

And that is why I drag the issue of culture into this matter. Just as we ask for laws to be amended in modern Nigerian societies by the people who represent us, we also need to call on these tribes to amend their customs and practices.

I am not Yoruba. The only affiliation I have to the tribe is with the men I have loved and love. 

My point is: we need to attack these old and worn cultural mores and tradition that is inherited ever so casually by young men from certain ethnic groups. Culture is a powerful tool, no matter where these men go – take them to Harvard and back; expose them to first world technology and advancement… a growing number of them still come back to this slum thinking of searching for girls under bamboo homes that they need to marry; not out of love, but out of the need to uphold tradition, and out of the desire to control these women. 

It is the strangest of things I have seen, that education hardly refines men of a certain tribe. 

But take an average Yoruba man to first-world realties, everything about him changes, his mind grows, he discards questionable traditions and problematic norms. He truly evolves.

Not so for the others. Not so.

I don't know anything about minorities. I am sticking to the three major ethnic groups as they taught us in school *kikikikiki!

I am aware there's an evolving class of men from these tribes- North and East, who have embraced modern principles and do not agree with the majority of their culture-clutching peeps who think impressionable teenage girls are the ideal target for matrimony. 

Dear North/East brothers of advanced thinking *coughs*… You are the gem in the mud. Culture has nothing on you, and that brilliant mind of yours makes us proud.

Epp us talk to your people.

Dalu. Na gode.

Oooosheeeey! *wink*
