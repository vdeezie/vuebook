I stopped using uber a year ago, after the first inappropriate driver-customer incident hit the internet. I read it, smirked, and went straight for the app on my phone. Delete!

I stopped seeing movies at Silverbird Cinema in Festac the minute I realised the mainland picture/audio quality was so bad it could pass for a N150 pirated cd in traffic. Then there was this exceptionally rude fool who was some kind of Island nigga brought to that branch to teach us civilisation. One day, he literally went hall to hall scolding adults not to click their phones in in the most disrespectful manner. Forget there were just 5 people in the hall I was in. He was an annoying trash. I left the hall, went looking for him afterwards, and we exchanged words - with him sounding like a deported identity from the streets of Brooklyn, after hustling 10 years, selling weed. 
It was the last time I ever went there. Close to a year now.

I don't drive through Orile at night. The last time I did, over two years ago, there was traffic and news reached us that robbers were coming our way. The helplessness of it was so frightening, it rid me of my basic human need - to feel safe and in control.

I once went to a Christ Embassy church where the pastor said members should pay tithe from their children's school fees (bwahahahahahhaha! Barawo banza). I never went back there again. Tueh. 

If you take my power to choose or limit my options to only what is available, I feel a part of the rewards of being alive is missing. I want to always be aware of my choices. I hate to feel stuck - like there's nowhere to go. Only animals in a cage should feel that way.

It is why I have never paid for any DSTV bouquet except premium, even though I watch only Crime and Investigation. I always want to be certain (that) all my options are laid out in front of me. Every single one of them.

So when I wake up every morning, I tell myself: I don't have to do this if it doesn't fulfil or align with my creative energy... I don't have to do that if it doesn't leave me happy.

-Because peace and joy and happiness and enthusiasm and contentment and awe are free. 

And I'm here for all of it. 

Good morning.
