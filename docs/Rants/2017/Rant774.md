In civilised countries...

If you lose a child, there's a group of 15 you can be part of where you can share your fears and pain, weekly. A group to help restore hope, to gather strength, to engage, to share your bereavement, your stagnation or moving-forward. 

If you are an alcoholic, there's a group of 33 you can join to help you through your love and hate of alcohol addiction. 

If you are a drug addict, same thing. 

If you are a new entrepreneur in a field, there's  a group of 50 to network, engage, discuss, dissect, plan.

If you are a woman of certain interests, there's a group of 20 with other women of similar interests waiting for you to join them.

If you are a man exploring new challenges, there's a group of 12 and all the amazing ideas that can come out of a weekly/monthly meeting.

But in uncivilised jungles like Nigeria...

There's only one place we go to address our bereavement, financial plans, travel ideas, alcoholism, drug addiction, new business plans...

That place is called the Office of a Pastor.

For some reason, ONE man has all the answers to all your problems from marital to financial to sexual to mental to ambitions.

And he is not God.

ONE man without a real job.

ONE man.

ONE.

And the chicanery of dining with the holy ghost.

Lol!

Abeg, let me go and drink Baileys.
