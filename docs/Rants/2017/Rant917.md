Inbox message this early morning: 

Hello Ms. Joy. There is this woman that married the love of her life. They have five children. After second pregnancy, the wicked man started to maltreat her. He will not contribute to the welfare of the family. But she continued to persevere and out of love and humility she born many more children and worked hard to meet their needs. But this wicked man continued to maltreat her until family and church members started begging him and praying for him, yet no change. Still wicked. All she wanted was to ensure her family stay together but the wickedness of the husband was too much, but she endured. After much wahala of many years, and cheating on her and making her life miserable, he finally carried her children away from her and took them to Alimosho local government to stay with his mother and another woman that he plans to marry. When the woman tried to get her children back, he gave her one hard blow and she fell to her death. 

Please how can we get justice for her?
