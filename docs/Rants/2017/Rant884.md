Shebi I started a revolution not too long ago. Then I had an encounter with the Nigerian Police. A simple case of fraud that I thought they would handle within a few weeks, since I had all the information to make their job easy. They failed woefully and shamelessly. I realised that the real frauds are probably in uniform. They hurt me emotionally. The Nigerian Police hurt me, and they tried to play smart with me.

I had to go back to my corner of the world to ask myself, “Do I REALLY want to have constant association with the Nigerian Police?”

Hell NO!

Then I also realized I had no effing desire to die for Nigeria, literally and figuratively.

My ambition is to get enough money and get my kids out of Nigeria. I want them to observe Nigeria like Kanu observes "Biafra" from a distance, like Sahara Reporters observe Naija politicians from a distance, like diasporans complain about Naija injustices from a distance.

I do not wish to be a messiah. Definitely not to Nigerians. 

So why did I think of starting a revolution just to gather 400 people and then go back home to eat ice cream?

I don’t know. But I know one thing: the system will not protect us. And Nigerians will fold their eba, dip it in oha soup and ask in mocking tones, “who send am? Shebi she wan show say she be badass.”

Tu fia! I am not #badass. I think there is woman on Facebook who likes that term. Not me. I am lots of things – icecream and jollof rice and Samsung phone and Clarins and dimples. Not badass. Thank you very much.

I don’t like this country. I don’t like what we do with politics, religion, health or education.

I don’t like that a police officer will tell a mother to forgive the rapist who defiled her child. I don’t like that pastors buy homes and SUVs with tithe and are above financial accountability. I despise our politicians. I cannot stomach the fact that maggi cube thieves are burned in open markets, and women are groped in Yaba just for daring to go shopping.

I don’t like Nigeria. And I cannot change Nigeria.

The only thing that will change Nigeria is the activism that focuses on re-branding the police. Save your Dulux paint and crisp uniforms, that’s not the branding I am talking about. These folks have to unlearn the shit in their brains. A total mental revolution. That’s what we need.

To have so much authority and be so stark ignorant is the biggest crime and injustice we face as a people. One of our major problems is the police.

I told y’all of the 13 year old girl who took her friend to the police so they can get justice. Her father was sleeping with her. And what did the police do? They told the child, “Get out of here!”

Then the good cops. What happened to the surviving policeman at a recent gun attack? His family is in Vanguard newspaper begging for help.

You can’t fight for anything if you have to deal with the police eventually. And activism commands  justice. How will you ever get justice in a country with a police like ours?

it is a cycle. Bad leadership - corrupt politicians - poor police system.

I am not going to stand on the street and get a stray bullet in my chest just so I can prove a point. You will die like a chicken and the state will not remember to buy your children pure water. 

If they lock you up. Nigerians will tweet your cause for a few days. Then everyone will return to their fight to win poverty OR the fight to sustain a lifestyle that is almost always about to slip from their grip.

The job of staying middle-class is a full time job.I am fully employed under its payroll. Sorry.

So once every 5 years or so we congratulate a lawyer for sending a rapist to jail. Just one successful case. Hundreds of rapist still roam the street. Abroad, they catch these losers everyday and keep them locked behind bars.

So my advice is: Don’t stand on the streets. Our problem is bigger than a march. People die in prison every day. Files get lost and nobody remembers. 

Save yourself for a better death experience - Somewhere on the beach sipping on the best exotic drink… then a slight, non-frightening heart attack.

Die luxuriously.
