# Rant946


August 26, 2017

I stumbled on the rant of a 22 year old girl who, apparently, has helped the entire world; and, according to her, not too many people show gratitude and/or reciprocate her good deeds. 

Her kind achievements include, but are not limited to: helping friends many times with money, campaigning for friends who needed financial assistance, paying school fees for friends, turning down sexual/marriage proposal of the ex of a friend, starting a girl empowerment organisation, surviving poison, survive nude threats, smiling when judged and cursed, loving women regardless. 

OK. 

If you do not have a healthy net worth, business spreading across, at least, three countries; a well-defined and achievable purpose... if you are not yet fully emotional and financially successful, you shouldn't spread yourself too thin. Not at 22. 

I know Nigerians like to think of wealth in terms of helping people even when you have nothing to give. And if the help you render is not reciprocated, the wealthier you are. Our judgment/logic is skewed.

It's a warped sense of importance that allow us stick to situations that hurt and/or demean us... then wait for the opportunity to use those hurtful moments to boost our moral quotient.

A 22 year old girl should be selfish. Thinking about your future. Making deliberate friendship with people who can play pivotal role in the structuring of your future.

A 22 year old shouldn't spread herself so thin, giving what she does not have. The journey is far. You are still re-discovering self. 

A 22 year old shouldn't be in a relationship for the sole purpose of marriage. Date to learn, to love, to grow. Date for curiosity. Dont make permanent decisions at 22. Don't be a housewife too soon (with/without a ring), washing toilets and kitchen tiles, just to prove something to someone just as average as you.

I think 22 year olds should give very little of themselves in terms of emotional charity and people-pleasing mechanics. Especially if you are a woman, mainly because it is the default attribute of the average 22 year old in a religious/patriarchal third world country where the only recreation is to try and prove that you are a "good and godly girl", and your main purpose is to dream and/or pray to marry early and take on the character of all the self-sacrficing roles available to simple women who live for family and pots of delicious soups. Unless you are a chef, that would be failing at 22. 

At 22, what you should focus on is giving real value and earning more value for self growth.

Be selfish at 22. Look out for yourself without hurting anyone. What that means is, you are not available for any drama or any activity that stretches you out of form.

Invest your time in developmental skills.

Times are changing. There's no future for a young person who spends all her time waiting to be accepted or loved.

Don't seek out good wishes, it's exhausting. That's what you do at 60.  

PS: When I address younger women on my posts, I am documenting my wishes and expectations of my daughters, not necessarily for any girl here. I sincerely don't care how any 22 year old on social media lives her life.
