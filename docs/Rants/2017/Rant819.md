My relationship is not #goals. Please I don't want that burden.

I talk about everything- my kids, my mum, my career, my accomplishments.. even my weaknesses come through on this wall.

I am not afraid of anything or anyone. I am not afraid of being judged. I am free. I am whole. Your judgment is your burden. You are trammelled by your dense imagination.

Facebook is the free platform that allows me confront my own demons. I am having daily conversations with myself on this platform, else I'd go mad. Nigeria will drive me insane. 

I have talked about everything, even when my daughter started experiencing her menstrual cycle. I am convinced that I would have taking a long walk into the horizon (similar to a story I wrote for Brittle paper) if I didn't have Facebook.

I have also shared heartbreak and humiliations. 

So in my true nature, I am presently documenting some of the great experiences I am having with someone. Because I am an adult and I want to! 

We didn't promise ourselves forever, and that is perfectly OK. As long as we treat each other right for as long as it lasts.

So please stop with the inbox messages. Chill with the unsolicited prayers. Don't tailor your relationship goals based on my present joy. It wouldn't be any less amazing if it ends today. Then what will you do... find someone else to mimic? No nah.

Don't even pray for it to last. That's nonsense. I want it to be beautiful while it lasts, whether for a day or two. That's all. We owe ourselves love and respect when we are together, and kindness when we are not.

A millenial sent a message. She said I inspired her to start using Clarins. 

I asked how much she earns.

She is presently an intern at a media company. 

And I made it clear I do not want to inspire that kind of decision!

You are making less than N60k a month and you are using Clarins. For what? What a way to set your priorities!

As if that isn't enough tragedy, I have those who share relationship pointers inbox:

Your man respects you because you are a strong woman.
Answer: Wrong. F9. A man respects a woman because he respects himself.

Your man loves your strength, he will stay with you.
Answer: Wrong. F9. A (wo)man loves you because he wants to. It is a decision.

It is because you are true to yourself that is why you have found true love.
Answer: Yawn. F9. People who are "untrue" to themselves find love everyday.

I am very sure if I get married tomorrow, it'd be: "Who said strong feminists cannot find love!"

Y'all need to calm your tits. 

A relationship is about ONE man who likes ONE woman. It is not a revolution and definitely not meant to change society.

It's just two people.

And would I be less fabulous if I am single? No!

For all I have done as a woman, I do not need a man's love to validate my happiness. Happiness will come with or without a man. Now it is with one. Can I write my stories on love as I have written everything else down to my alopecia?

I want to document my happiness without motivating anyone.

Can I just write my experiences in peace?

Thanks.
