There's a narrative for rape victims in Nigeria that I find disturbing, irritating. 

The narrative that suggests the main punishment for a rapist is to watch his victim grow through the years to become relatively successful and famous.

After raping her from when she was a child, the true victory for the victim is to become successful... and one day, the rapist will be in a crowd when she (victim) receives an award or gets a rousing applause for a job.

And for the fact that the rapist could be uncomfortable to see his victim become "something" in life should be enough penalty for his crime. Let's not forget the ultimate method of forgiveness. When he walks quietly to the high-table where she is seated above him, still enjoying her moment... and he asks for forgiveness.

Shoot me!

In another narrative, the fact that a victim eventually finds a man to marry regardless of her "past", and she's able to have children... then one day bumps into the rapist at a mall and watch his mouth drop, is just the right justice for his crime.

Victims share these testimonies, like victory anthems. And I hold no grudge with that BUT these narratives of victims becoming successful should not be the only retribution of a crime. 

Victims should not be burdened with the idea of "shaming" their "enemies" by "making it in life".

If a victim turns out a drug addict for the rest of her life, the rapist should still feel shame and still face judgment.

We always make life too easy for predators.

If the only penalty for raping a child is to look out for her success story down the line, then it is a convenient crime.

It shouldn't matter what becomes of a rape victim, the rapist should face legal punishment. Stop telling victims to "become something in future" as the best revenge for the pain she suffered.

And for victims who manage to "find husbands" and success after rape,  try not to sell this ruse as the justice rapists deserve. 

There was this sticker that was quite popular when I was a child...

"Let my enemies live long and see what I will be in future."

Even as a child, I thought it to be a stupid quote. We don't do things for our "enemies". If your enemy was a rapist who stole your childhood, his penalty should not be about your final success. Should your failure then justify what he did?

If a rape victim eventually turns out a wreck in life, should it ever justify the actions of a rapist? 

We make this thing too easy for bad people!

Be happy you succeeded, whatever that means... but recognise that you didn't have to be  raped to succeed.

A rapist should be in jail. That entire crap about "his conscience disturbing him through the years", is just what it is - Crap!
