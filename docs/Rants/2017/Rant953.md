I was trying to explain Hurricane Irma to my kids. 

It's like explaining racism to a child who sees only black people all her life. When your teacher is black, your neighbour is black, the police is black, the cashier at the mall is black. You may never fully understand Racism unless you experience it.  

Hurricane isn't something you want to experience firsthand, such tragedy should only be demonstrated in other ways. Watching CNN still seems like a movie of sort for their young minds. 

Hmm. What to do?

So I see two ants taking a leisue walk in my sink... I call the kids.

"Now watch..." I said

I blow air from my mouth, so hard it knocks one ant out. It slams its head on the other end of the sink. And dies.

The other ant survived the puff of air.

Then I fill a cup with water and pour the water with exaggerated force into the sink; splashing everywhere.

"Ahn. Ahn. It's too much force nah," they cried. 

"Exactly."

The ant, of course, died.

They both witnessed Hurricane Irma.

No joking matter, but kids have to know these things beyond Wikipedia explanation.
