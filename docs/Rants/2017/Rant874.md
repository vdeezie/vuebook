Sorry oh!

I don't want to be a kill joy, but I remember that Uber love story and I have som'tin to say:

So, when the lady got into the Uber cab, conversation revealed the driver spent sometime abroad. Yes?

Then her next question was: "why are you driving an Uber then?" 

My answer would be, "why not?"

Graduates should take up any job that gives satisfaction. 

Graduates should be drivers, mechanics, hairdressers, painters, electricians. Graduates should sell tomatoes in the open market. Graduates should do anything they want to do without the need to defend their profession.

Education should expand your opportunities, not shrink them.

I think we need more graduates involved in the informal market. 

What we should be questioning is Dignity in labour. Not necessarily what people choose to do. 

Graduates ride Uber abroad. They clean streets. They are fully part of the informal business sector. Nobody bats an eye. Why?

DIGNITY.

In Nigeria, you can't even walk down the streets without someone thinking you are unfortunate for not driving a car. That's why all our waists are expanding. After one big fat meal, you enter a big fat car, get to your destination and sit in a big fat chair. And we think this is life? Rubbish!

In Manhattan, professional executives drive bicycles to the office. Try that in Nigeria, and watch your enemies rejoice. "His end has come!" They would celebrate. Whereas they all drive cars but can barely meet up with debts.

We have typecast jobs for graduates and non-graduates. That prejudice is what makes us scorn certain jobs.

Every graduate in Naija is pictured in a suit or a thriving medium scale business. It is one reason we are under-developed.

If we continue to shame people for the legit jobs they do, and demand that they defend their choices, then uhuru is very far away.

What we do is get into people's lives and change their jobs. Why? What if he likes fixing tyres and want to be a vulcanizer? Why should that job be for a never-do-well?

If everyone sits behind a desk, whose going to fix our leaking pipes and fix our cars?

We should be pushing for dignity for all legit jobs.

The man in an SUV screaming, "do you know who I am?!" to the security guard is not something that happens in first world countries. Because both the SUV man and the security guard are equal.

Period.
