As we read "Bedtime Stories for Rebel Girls" this evening...

The girls wanted to know what INTEGRITY really is. Since I say it all the time, the definition just isn't enough. 

"Tell us an instance of true Integrity," they said.

So I popped my collar and told them the story of their mother. Lol!

Years ago, when I had barely N15,000 in my account, and someone mistakenly transfered one million naira to me... 

For someone who had nothing, that money looked like it could buy me the world. 

I didn't wait a second, I called her immediately and told her that she sent money to my account that obviously was meant for someone else - someone who had worked for it.

This woman argued with me. Said she didn't make any transfer to my account. We argued for 15 minutes. I told her to check her transactions. 

30 minutes later, I was the one still calling her. Telling her to send her bank details so I can fix the error.

It took her one hour to confirm what I had been saying. She was starting a bakery and thought she made a transfer to one of her workers to buy certain equipment, but she mistakenly made it to me.

She was a former client I had worked with for brand publicity. 

She became restless and wouldn't stop sending messages to get me to send back the money. But only an hour ago, she didn't accept the error. It was 5pm, I don't do online banking, so I told her it'd be done the next morning. 

But trust Nigerians, she kept sending religious quotes, probably as means to ward off the devil, just in case I changed my mind.

I was offended, of course. Na me call you, tell you say you transfer one million to my akant. Rest! I'll do it in the morning.

The next morning, by 6am, she buzzed again. Ugh! I switched off my phone. 

By 8.30am, I was at the bank, did the transaction, switched on my phone and called her.

"I hate that you would think you need to bother me consistently for an error I brought to your attention. Your religious quotes are silly and your calls are annoying. I have made the transfer, not because of anything you did... but because THE MONEY ISN'T MINE."

She apologised and thanked me.

When I told my mum, she said, "Na wa! So she no even drop anything for you?"

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

My account shrunk back to its former size of N15,000.

And I was happy.

My girls looked at me in awe, "Wow! One million naira. Mummy! That's wonderful."

"That's integrity," I said.

*wink*

PS: Can I add that I have never, after that experience, had my account shrink to a size so small? Ever!

The Universe knows something.
