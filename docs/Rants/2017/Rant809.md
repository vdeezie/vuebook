Let me understand this...

It is OK to talk about writing a new book, getting a promotion, winning a competition, getting a new career/business gig, building your own house, buying a new car...

It's acceptable to talk about your trip to Seychelles; share pictures of your newborn; perfectly cool to talk about a bad day, a good day, the day you got yourself an expensive camisole...

It is fine to post pictures of you in a bathrobe in a hotel room (turn to the corner so we see through the window that you are somewhere in Paris or Jo'burg)... 

It is OK to grab selfies with friends and celebrities. OK to share types of diet to save your weight, exercise routines. Great idea to share your butt dimple peeping through that cheap lycra dress; not a crime to share the new collection you got from a store.

BUT it is not OK to talk about the person you are in love with?

We can talk about our parents, our kids, our lovely colleagues, our great bosses, our best friends...

But we can't talk about a romantic partner. The man or woman you are with.

That's show-off.

And oh! It makes others uncomfortable. Others who have something to hide and/or others without a love story. 

We can talk about everything, except love.

-Because talking about it kills it. Apparently it is the ONLY thing in our lives that can topple over when it is treated like everything else in our lives.

Oh! And what if it ends? What if you part ways? Ah! The pain, the heart breaking into tiny pieces of hurt. What if...er...it..it...it... 

It shows our deep hypocrisy, dark mistrust and constant chewing of panadol for other people's headache.

We are constantly telling people what to do. What to say. 

Whoever told you a relationship is stronger when it is "private" is probably struggling through debt or dating two (wo)men. Or held down by something (culture, religion, that thing around your neck).

Yup.

Being "private" about a relationship isn't synonymous to being mature. 

You wish!

Months ago I was caught between two good men, trying to make a choice. And I realised how difficult it was to talk about the very impressive things one of them was doing... because I didn't want the other to see. 

And I realised how convenient it was to act all "private" when indeed I could be dating two men (which I didn't. I finally made my choice).

And what is private anyway? Maybe there's nothing to say just yet; wait till he gets you a two-week ticket to an Island, lodging in a hotel on water.

Are you saying you won't say a word if you find a shiny black beast of a landcruiser in your frontyard one morning, ribboned and delivered with your initials on it.

Tah! Get away, you!

I am just a tad bit bored with this private vs public relationship debate.  

Why don't you just live your own life?

Some people do shout-outs and hashtags for their lovers on Instagram, then come on Facebook to knock on doors, warning others to tune off/down the volume of their love posts.

By all means love as you wish.

I have friends here who constantly share selfies with the men in their lives, and that's fine. (PS: I sincerely enjoy seeing Debbie Edwards' posts with her man).

And I know men who keep their relationships private, yet are open to romantic relationships with other women. 

Women who claim to be private just because they are yet to find something to talk about.

By now, you should know we make decisions based on our needs or lack. There's no template on how to live as an adult. There are no models to copy. We draw our patterns on how we want to love.

First charter a yacht and sail across Greece... then come back here with your mute button. Don't you dare share a word of that adventure. 

Private, my cute ass. 

Stop judging people's right to express happiness based on your KFC lunch breaks, abeg.

Warning: Sharing names, private location and personal details can be dangerous. But feel free to share nice gifts and loving messages.

Happy Valentine's Day in advance. I'm totally looking forward to mine.
