No "Happy Mother's Day" here.

Everyday my mother takes care of my children just so I can do great things. Focus on work. Focus on my ambitions. Make some money. Create some happiness.

There's nothing I would have been able to conquer or achieve if my mother wasn't in the picture. 

She makes my single-motherhood look like piece of cake. 

It is to her credit that I am happy, younger, more beautiful. 

My mother is a verb. A force. A constant action word.

This is why I never celebrate Mother's Day.

Where do I begin?

I can't pack all her awesomeness into 24 hours. And I don't think I want to celebrate her when everybody else is doing just that.

Because without this woman, I am nothing.

It is as simple as that.

I don't like to think about it too much because it makes me feel inadequate. I don't think I'll be able to ever live up to the sacrifices she makes.

That puts her in the realm of a god.

And sometimes gods should be left to do their good works. It is in that knowing that they live their best form.

She's no mere mortal.
