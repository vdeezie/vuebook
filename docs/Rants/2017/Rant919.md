Hello ma.

Hello.

How was your night, ma?

(Silence)... Good.

OK. How's work?

Get to your point.

Ma?

You called for a reason. Get to it. 

OK. You see, I have always liked Shonda Rhimes. I know you like her too. And Mo Abudu is my absolute hero.

To the point, please.

Yes. I was saying that Mo Abudu is someone I want to be like. 

I don't have her number to give you.

No. No. I'm not asking for her number.

Then get to your point.

OK. I have always dreamed of becoming a media success -

To the point, please! I have a meeting to prepare for!

OK. I... ah! Maybe I should call later when you have time.

I don't ever have time. Say your point. Start with your name.

OK,  my name is Onions. I am from Onitsha.

What do you want, Onions?

I tried to reach you last month but it was like you were busy, so I dropped an email...

You need to go straight to the reason you called.

OK. Sorry, I'm not very good at this.

Good at what exactly? 

Good generally.  

Miss, What. Do. You. Want?

Ok. I will like to intern at your company.

This conversation happened. It happened with a voice that sounded tired and bored. 

I realise many people think this approach is endearing. It is not. If you were anywhere near me, I'd slam your head on my desk. You can't talk like this to a stranger whom you seek career opportunities. I am not your lover.

If you want to work with someone, this is how your first call should go:

Hello (chirpy and alive, please! No drooling mess)

Hello.

My name is Onions.

OK. 

I just concluded NYSC. I have a degree in Mass communication from UNN. I would really like an opportunity to work with you.

Period!

Any questions or comments after that should come from the recipient whom you wish to work with.

These things are important. Stop drooling on the phone; don't sound tired or sick or slow all in a bid to get empathy. Stop it.

This conversation happens too many times for it to be ignored.

Be professional. Nothing else should be acceptable.
