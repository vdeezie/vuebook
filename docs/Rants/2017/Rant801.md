What's the most dramatic ish you've done in a relationship? 

Hehehe. I remember this one:

I used to do a lot of fringes because I had to cover half of my forehead. Someone used to make me feel insecure about it... but when I grew more confident about my body and my beauty, I decided to kick all that self-conscious bullcrap to the curb. 

I don't even go to the office with make up these days. I have done a 360 degree self-awareness body-loving twirl. 

My self confidence took one big leap one day and... bam! 

This was probably where it all started...

Some years back, I had a dinner date. It was supposed to be his special day, he was receiving an award. 

He sent me an invitation card with flowers and a note:

"My special day. Come celebrate with me, darling Joy."

As a Yoruba guy, you can't be so sure if you are the only one receiving that special flower and "darling" prefixing your name.

Nonetheless, I called to thank him for the flowers, and asked what the dress code was. Dinner would imply an evening dress, but I wanted conversation for a few minutes before it was time for the event.

I love conversation, so I called just to chat him up before he gets too busy with preparation and wouldn't be able to pick a call...

Right in the middle of lighthearted conversation, he said: "Fringe. Wear a fringe on your hair. You have a wide forehead."

The words hit me like a hurricane. My spirit left my body, hit the wall and died. I gathered my remains and patched it up as best as I could. 

OK. 

Fuming, I went to the salon.

"Push every fucking hair to the back. I want my large forehead on display."

"Ah. Aunty Joy, you have nice face nah, anything go fit you." My hairdresser smiled. 

When it was time, I drove to the venue.

I had my full glorious forehead in all its arrogance, waiting to see the look on his face.

It came right on time.

"Wow. You look nice. You know you always look nice. I see you played the rebel. Typical," he forced a smile, all the while wishing he could strangle me, I'm sure.

"Yes. I decided a fringe would look better on your penis. So I came to tell you just that."

"Haba Joy. I didn't mean it that way. You are pretty."

"You think I need your endorsement, that is why you manipulate compliments as it suits you every single time. Whoever told you I need to hear a word from you about how I should feel about myself?"

"Just sit; the event is about to start. We will talk about this later. Did you like the flowers?"

"I don't have a vase. And I can't sit. I am dressed for another occasion."

So I took my forehead and my gorgeous dress and went to the cinema to catch a movie.

Oh don't feel sorry for him, I'm sure he went home with one of the other "flower girls" present. 

He apologised later, but I knew I was always going to feel forehead-insecure around him, so I moved on.

-And I never did a fringe again. 

Ever again.
