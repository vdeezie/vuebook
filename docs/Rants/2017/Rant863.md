Unlike many, I am not a believer of humanity.

The motive for selflessness is usually egocentric and narcissistic. 

When we claim to care more for others than we do for ourselves, that in itself is a performance. And performances are made for opportunities and for self gratification. 

And there is nothing wrong with that, as far as I am concerned.

What I cannot stand is a claim to noble standards than is really the case. 

Our hypocritical religions have refused to accept that humans, from the time of Cain and Abel, were designed to worship self, put self first and promote self above all else. Altruism is meant to reward the greed in humans. Our flair for showmanship can be traced to our daily habits - what we cook, how we design our homes, what our cars look like, the appearance of our children, our skills in bed,, our hunger for promotion. Even our desire to change the world has some elements of self-absorption.

If it didn't, then there'd be a problem. You are human. It is in your nature to be self-seeking. 

When an average couple that can barely afford a vacation gives birth to, say, 8 daughters and one little son... it is not for a selfless cause to save the male gender from extinction. It is so that they too can brag about whatever and be accepted into whatever and be part of whatever gossip without feeling left out of something they believe weighs just as important as Macron becoming president.

Banky W, of the amazing head, didn't marry a random breadseller. He married selfishly - a beautiful actress. Our nobility, sacrifices and magnanimity doesn't seem to extend to personal choices. 

This also applies to the spare part dealer training Ngozika in school so he can wed her. It is a selfish little act encouraged by society.

Did you hear what the Emir said to a woman whose 6 months old child was raped?

"Accept it as her destiny." Something like that- of such shocking callousness. 

I do not believe in humanity. 

I believe in justice. Period.

You cannot love me more than you love yourself. You cannot attend to the needs of my child with as much enthusiasm as I would. 

The aim of society shouldn't be to "moralise" humans. Nigeria is one of the most religious slums in the world. As I write this, there's a church across my street and the pastor is speaking in loud tongues. On Sundays it is a carnival of tongues... YET we are vile people always quick to "forgive". 

Our forgiveness is lazy, just so we do not get to think. God forbid that we apply reason to any situation. 

The problem with Nigeria is not that there are bad people. The problem is there is no consequence for bad people.

If girls are raped by boys after exams, boys should be charged to court and sent to jail. Period. 

Dragging morals and religion into it is a waste of time. When boy comes out of jail after 14 years and desires to be part of civilised society, he can be grafted in. If he commits another crime, off to jail again. His wasted life will inspire many more.

Your religion plays no role in social reformation. 

I am staring at the brand new Teebillz, under tutelage of a life coach, and I laugh. He is broke, wasted and worth very little without Tiwa. Of course he will "repent"! Who is going to pay for his exaggerated lifestyle. Which other musician is going to split his/her stage fee in half to feed his Lekki lifestyle and still get to have sex with him and tolerate his cheating, catering to his edibles *cough*. Anybody? 

You call that repentance?

Think.

Take this nun, for instance, pimping deaf children to priests (read story: http://happenings.com.ng/nun-arranged-deaf-children-sexually-abused-priests-nabbed/)

If she was a Nigerian, we will surrender her to one god and quickly "forgive" her. She will claim the devil is to blame; Nigerians will forget all about her, after calling for her head on social media... The Police will be quick to respond with a daft statement:

"It is not actually rape. The priests were placing communion in their private parts instead of on  their tongues. Innocent mistake. But we will look into the matter and make necessary arrests."

In a real society, she faces jail time. Period.

Don't pray for good. Pray for justice. You cannot achieve good trusting in humanity. You achieve good when The Police and the judiciary are competent and functional.

What we need is a Police force with integrity, not necessarily "good" people.
