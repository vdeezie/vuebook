Random videos online displaying random acts of kindness probably orchestrated for that purpose do not, in my view, promote the goodness of humanity.

These videos tell us how awful we are as humans.

That we need videos to tell us how a beggar was invited into a 5-star restaurant to feast with a billionaire and his family is what upcoming youtube reality shows are made of.

These acts of kindness on tape show how much of kindness we have lost.

We are celebrating the shreds of our humanity, so we record whatever is left for when we would have to tell a generation yet unborn, "this is what we used to be." More like your father telling you he always came first in class. Where's the proof?

Our wretched kindness is stored by online actors on you tube to remind us what kindness should be and how marvelous we are and how we shouldn't yet give up on humanity. 

But you and I know that there's no millionaire having lunch at Radisson with the beggar sitting at Mile 12. Unless it is for the purpose of TV or to complete the last pages of his autobiography. 

Humans are not "kind" people. Kindness is a side effect of our daily living and hustle. Something that requires you to take into consideration your inconvenience and, sometimes, risk that may be tragic.

We are not kind people. And this is not for those who should give kindness...

I am speaking of those who receive kindness. They are not kind people these receivers of kindness. 

You let a relative in to your home. You have shown kindness. His job is to give back kindness by respecting the body and dignity of your daughters or maids.

He doesn't. He is unkind.

You employ people out of faith and friendship. They show their unkindness through mediocre performance.

You borrow money. The borrower becomes your nightmare, taunting you, refusing to pay back. S/he is unkind.

The kind act, in these cases, would be NOT to give. Not to open your doors. Not to employ. 

These kinds acts will save you seasons of conflict and acrimony. 

For these reasons, kindness should be re-branded to meet the realities of humans. A little polish to its mumu-ism. Buff the naivete out of it. 

Kindness should be your action, your reward to an unkind person. 

It could come as a police report. A sack letter. Your doors locked and sealed from relatives coming in. An extra padlock to your account. A long stare back at the man asking for yet another "fix".

Kindness should start from the one we have come to acknowledge as the receiver. 

What this means is: If you want a meal, ask to do something for the man who can pay for your meal. Reverse compassion. Trust me, he needs help too.

If you want school fees, ask to work for the person who you wish can sponsor your education. Be kind to his hustle. 

If you want a place to stay. Build a record of kindness towards children and the vulnerable.

This is the only way the world can truly change. We are rushing head first into depths of depravity.

Switch the roles. 

Show some kindness. Use your full month's salary and pay for a return ticket to New York for your boss' next work leave. The boss who has paid you every dime for the work you have done all these years.

YOU, take up all his/her responsibility for that period. Know what it feels like to be "burdened" with leadership.

I plan to do that soon.

Don't ask for a raise. Ask him/her if the company is making enough money to continue with, say, it's expansion.

Not everytime be at the receiving end of kindness. 

It is why the world needs to celebrate snippets of edited random kindness. 

Because kindness is sincerely unfair to those we assume don't need it.
