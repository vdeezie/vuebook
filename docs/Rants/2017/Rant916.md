Heading to work this morning. Three area boys were pushing their way through traffic, to make way for a white Range Rover. 

They stood right in front of my car. 

One of them tried intimidation. He made those annoying agbero movements to suggest he will smash my window if I didn't let "Oga white jeep enter".

I shook my head. Eez like this one thinks I just landed from Manhattan after 10 posh years having civil conversations. Mscheeeeew!

The second one tried pleading in a way that was both entitled and beggarly.  I ignored him completely. 

It was bumper-to-bumper gridlock, yet they wanted so desperately for "Oga white jeep to jus' push his head inside".

I was already thinking of the dark airless cell they will sleep this night. Just because.

Then the third area boy came to my window. Of course, I didn't wind down. 

He said: "Aunty journaleez ("Journalist". I have a Press tag on my car)...abeg help me allow am pass. I fit get small money from the Oga if him enter your front wey I go take chop this moreen. Abeg".

Sigh.

Now that killed every braggadoccio in my spine.
