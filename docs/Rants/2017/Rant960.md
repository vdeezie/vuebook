I don't think it's in my place to "check up" on people when they leave social media for a while.

- Because social media isn't exactly reality. Someone's "disappearance" doesn't make them ill, broken, busy or dead.

I feel it is intrusive...almost like begging you to come back and be mediocre. 

"Hello I haven't seen you online for a week, are you OK?"

Sounds like: "Are you off to go get a life? Is that fair? Didn't we all agree to just be average?"

Lol!

It's like alcohol buddies checking up on you when you fail to show up at the bar for two weeks.

You're not dead. You're not sick. You're probably working towards a healthier life. And quitting alcohol is a good thing.

Quitting social media too is commendable. Unless you have found a way to make good money on this platform, and it drives your brand and career... you should take long breaks without social media folks chasing after you,  right into your life as it exists as opposed to the notional idea of you as they see on Facebook.

For instance, the reality of my day is: I missed my flight to a summit that was fully paid because ONE stamp was missing on my non-visa invitation. A forgivable and understandable slip from the Marrakesh team because they had over 250 guests to fly in from France, New York, Venezuela. I'm sure other small and not-so-small slips will surface for a few other guests also. And it is fine. But it made my morning very shitty, as I felt a strong desire to RECLAIM MY TIME. 

I don't worry when money is lost (thankfully, I didn't buy the ticket), but I am always sore when I waste TIME. Time is the only currency I recognise. When I spend an hour with an unproductive and uninspiring person, I literally go home and weep. I'd rather give that person money, not my time.  

Ultimately, I'd rather not give any.

But I deviate. I was talking about social media and why it is OK to take long breaks.

If Facebook is not linked to your financial statements, then your timeline is not an office, and you don't have to check in everyday.

So on this note, after observing her e-absence for over 7 months and one mail sent without response...

Can someone, please, assure me that Nneoma Albert-Benson is OK?
