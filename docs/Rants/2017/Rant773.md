A friend loaned me a sizeable amount of money for a personal project last year.

We agreed on a payment plan: N100,000 every month until I pay up by the end of the year.

Every month, when he received the alert, he would send a "thank you, I'm grateful" message.

For months, I didn't understand it.

I should be the one grateful and sending thank you notes when I pay.

I made the last payment today, and again he sends his gratitude and thanks, buttered with "God bless you, Joy."

I only just understood his constant appreciation: Nigerians do not pay up their loans and debts.

Though he is not in Nigeria, he is impressed that I made payments as agreed. But this is his money, and in normal societies where people still have shame and honour, he shouldn't hold his breath and be profusely thankful for RECEIVING HIS OWN MONEY.

It's really sad that we carry this reputation around. 

You'd wonder why he gave the loan in the first place if the worry of the "Nigerian deceit" may mar his chances of getting back his money?

He wanted to trust. He wanted to trust. He wanted to trust.

To have faith.

We are daily ruining the opportunity of trust and faith in the next human being because Nigerians have no shame.

They live in debt. Brag about owing. Display wealth when they haven't yet sorted their debts. And ultimately use religion to attack their creditors.

It is a religious sham: when they see pastors who do not actually have day jobs or a business make so much money.

Have you been to a typical Nigerian church? When they gather your offerings and tithes, they bless the baskets with these words...

"May you reap where you did not sow; may you inherit the land of the unbeliever; may you find UNMERITED favour."

One of such methods to enjoying "unmerited fucking favour" is collecting a loan and praying that the creditor forgets to ask for his money. 

It's crazy, but this is the life of the average Nigerian.

When a creditor continues to thank you for paying the money that rightly belongs to him... Know that it is a reaction to the badly raised and entitled people living a life so "godly" yet insolvent and putrid. 

This year, try to be better.

There's no god bigger than your conscience.
