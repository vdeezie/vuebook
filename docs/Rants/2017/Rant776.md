Dear Millenial writers,

Let me tell you a few things that can help your money-making career-building prospects this year...

Always write an introductory letter when responding to a vacancy ad via email. Don't just dump your CV like a rock-bottom casket for your potential employer to open.

*
Do not start the introductory letter with "Hello Dear". It's outrageously silly. 

It's either "Dear Ma" or "Dear Sir". Or stick with "Good Afternoon". Be as impersonal as possible.

*
Do not share your personal challenges, share your strengths. 

Eg: "I don't really know this job but I am willing to learn." 

Why then are you sending a mail if you don't know??? Unless you are coming in as an intern without pay, do not look for a job with that Nigerian tragedy that we mistake for humility.

*
Never end a letter with: "God bless you."
It is manipulative. It is unprofessional. It is off-putting. 

*
Do not send the manuscript of your unpublished book, all 45,000 words of fiction, when you are told to send a sample of your work. Unless you are summoned by the amazing Azafi of Parresia, the rest of us need quick, short, crisp, witty, straight to the matter lifestyle articles that'll make our readers laugh, cry or get mad.

I like "get mad" better. For laugh or cry, people forget easily. But when you get them mad, especially Nigerians, it stays for a while and you get to reap all the fruits that can help your career.

***
When you finally get a phone interview, do not drool like someone out of sex. Be alert. Use the smartest tone of your voice. Speak out. Let your words be confident.

Do not lie about any information. It'll come back to haunt you.

Do not tell your interviewer to check out your Facebook posts when s/he requests for links or samples of your work.

Do not name drop. If you have to, drop two names and that should be it. Do not make your phone interview a drop fest of popular names that mean nothing to your interviewer. You are the star of your interview, leave celebrities or your "famous aunty" out of it please.

"I can write everything" is not a career goal. That's what children say. An adult looking to build a profession must specialise in an area(s), an expert in a particular skill.

Never ask for what you will earn in the first stage of communication with an interviewer. You should first love the prospect of a new job, a new dream, a new life, a new challenge.

Do not flash the interviewer. Call. Ugh!

Another thing: Do not relocate because of a promise of a job that you are yet to get a confirmation for. Do not get to Oshodi bus garage and start making frantic calls to an interviewer that you are now in Lagos and ready for a job. Come to a new city because you want to be in a new city and be closer to the opportunities the new city offers. When you finally settle into the city and sorted your accommodation, then you can apply for jobs as a resident of the new city. 

Don't beg for the job. Be qualified for it. Unless you want to be the one buying the rest of the crew amala for lunch.

And if you get the job, come with your own laptop. Be at the office 15 minutes before official hour of resumption, say 7:45am. 

Be badass at your job. Write like you are fighting with a sword: 

How, you say?

Take in your surrounding. Calculate your strategy. Keep your balance. Engage with care. Have a strong defense. Make the first strike count. Maintain a distance between you and the subject that allows for unprejudiced reporting or review. Drop the dramatics and go for the kill.

Writing should not be as deadpan and lazy as a bullet to the head. 

That's all for now.

That's another N5 investment into your 2017.

Don't mention. Just go and be great, abeg. 

Go!
