I accepted a new intern yesterday only because she is magic, her skill that is. Oh! She can write.

When I was searching for campus reporters, I got one hundred lousy submissions; glowing in the mud was this gem. I read her, and I smiled.

I called her immediately, and when I heard her tiny voice, I just cried mehn!

A student in UNN. She had to write for me.

So she wrote three pieces about hostel living, and captured every detail with the precision of a fine artist. I haven’t been so happy to pay a writer like I did when I paid her for her work.

Then she went quiet. She crossed my mind one evening and I tried to reach her. She promised she’d write something soon enough. The articles stopped coming after the third one. She didn’t keep to her promise. So I had just three articles to remind me of her.

Then on Monday I get a call. It was her!

She’s in Lagos for a three-month internship, and would like to work for Happenings.

Of course! I didn’t think twice. We aren’t even taking interns at the moment, but fuck it! I’ll pay her from my pocket if I have to.

Her father called Tuesday morning to ensure it wasn’t a fluke. He introduced himself as the Chairman of one Association which, well, made me fart. He called to interview me kwa. So I had to remind him I run an office not a school. And I do not take calls from husbands, boyfriends and parents.

He understood immediately. And the call ended. LOL!

Not even the father could dull my mood. I started Tuesday on a happy note. I totally have faith in his daughter, which is something I feel only when the moon turns blue and floats in the sky like a balloon.

So she came around. Oh dear! Such a little geek. Your first impression of her is nothing. You may ignore her presence only because there are no striking features. Ah! But her mind…her mind! Whew! 

Then I asked her about the long silence…

“Whatever happened to you? I didn’t hear from you for so long.” I gave her a big hug.

“Ah well…” she started into a story that left my mouth hanging.

She was committed to a psychiatric hospital.

Why?

She jumped off a storey building, because she felt like jumping.

Huh?

“I wanted to jump. And I did. I can’t understand why that is such a terrible thing to do.”

Okaaaay. My brow hanging in the air. 

“Are you suicidal?” I asked.

“Absolutely not! I only wanted to jump. And I did. I just had to know,” she said.

LOL! Don’t even try to understand, y'all. Don’t hurt yourself😂😂 

She is priceless. Whether she jumps off tall buildings or not, she is a good writer, and that’s all that matters to me.

“Welcome home,” I smiled.

The most beautiful part of this story is… Someday, we will be blessed with a brilliant work that will demonstrate the alluring darkness, fascinating demons and extraordinary eeriness of her character

…If Nigeria doesn’t win in the battle of destroying her beautiful mind, that is.
