So... I am heading to work this morning. It's raining. A woman hits me from behind.

It's a bad one. Half the bumper is crushed. Thankfully there's no damage to the light. 

Small matter. The only problem is the rain, as it amplifies the situation. Everyone is wet. I'm more distraught that my weave is damp.

We alight. The woman asks, "what are we going to do now?"

Typical stupid question. I ignore her. Thankfully this happens at a junction near a mechanic shop. I call the mechanic. 

Before a mechanic arrives, a lazy man who witnessed the incident is already fondling with my bumper, repeating in Igbo to the satisfaction of the woman: "it is a mistake. Na mistake."

I ignore him the first time. Second time. Third time.

Fourth time? I tell him to shut up and get lost. He is shocked. "So because I want to help that is why you are -"

"Dude, get lost. You are annoying me."

He leaves. Mechanic arrives. He looks at the damage. The rain isn't letting up. He moves from one vehicle to the other, passing instructions between the woman and I.

He charges N6,000 for the damage. I tell him to tell her to pay the money. She hit me for godsake! I stopped for a car infront to move. It wasn't sudden. Her vision may have been blurred due to the rain, and that is fine, but I wasn't in the wrong.

The woman says she wants us to talk about it. Talk about what? I wonder. Pay the money and go.

When we finally find shelter from the rain, this woman legit blamed me for the accident. 

"Why did you stop abruptly? You should not have stopped. Why didn't you wave or something."

Now the mechanic is amused. He obviously has seen this too many times.

I am furious. "Oh! I stopped abruptly?"

"Yes you did!"

"Madam, you are not well," I tell her.

I leave her under the shelter, back into my car. I refuse to have an argument under the rain because of N6k!

She comes to my window. 

"Madam, instead of you to say that we should negotiate..." she says.

"After accusing me of being wrong?" I am fuming. "Madam go! I place a curse on you this day."

Loooool! 

Her countenance changes. She starts to beg.

Lol! Nigerians are such disgrace. There's no shame, no decency to any approach unless we evoke a curse or doom from the spirit world.

"I have N1k here. Can you collect it?" She begs profusely. 

I feel insulted. I tell her to go away.

She continues begging. Not because she wants to do the right thing, she just doesnt want a curse on her. 

"I've called my husband," she announces.

"Because of N6k? Madam please go away."

"Please can you remove the curse?" She begs. 

Sigh. This is hilarious. Now I have some kind of spiritual authority over her. She wants "forgiveness" and the curse removed. I am amused.

She finally leaves. Mechanic and I talk about dubious people. He gives me an umbrella and fixes my car.

The woman returns with half the sum. I collect it. She asks for the curse to be removed. 

I ask, "what curse?"

The only reason she came back was for a "curse" to be removed. 

Do you still wonder why there are many spiritual charlatans thriving in Nigeria?
