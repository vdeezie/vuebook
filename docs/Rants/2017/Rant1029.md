Pandas, quite frankly, are brighter than people who send this trash. 

And pandas are really stupid animals... I mean, reeeeeally fucked up stupid. They can't tell when they are pregnant. They don't recognise their own offspring. They can't tell the food made for their own body so they survive on low  nutriton which affects brain power. Pandas are meant to be carnivores, I think. But they are busy eating bamboo and live below the nutrient requirement their body needs.

So if you ever worry that humans may be this stupid, your worries are legit because they are humans just as stupid as pandas - sending broadcast messages and asking that the message be sent back to them to show that they are special or loved.

These people are serial killers, I tell you. You can't be a normal person when you ask for someone to send back what you gave them. 

I am so proud that I do not have one person on my friend list who'd send me something so frightfully daft.

These ones crawl out from followers list. *cringe
