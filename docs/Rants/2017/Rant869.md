I don't understand movies or articles or whatever that tell us to choose between Family and Work.

Why do we have to choose?

Family is important. Work is important.

There's a thin line between the Work you do and the love you receive from Family. 

Have you ever been the broke one in a family? The one always seeking help and favours? You'd realise the importance of Work.

Family is a group of people who (should) work! Your get-togethers are enriched by your work experiences.

Your older sister wants to meet up with you to see how you are doing. "How you are doing" is mainly about Work.

"How's your finances? Did you get the promotion? Will you be travelling for the conference?" That's valid conversations amongst family members. Work brings Family together. 

And love is sustained when everyone in the family makes their own money. Not so that you can brag about it, no! But so you can earn some respect, and make your family proud of you. 

I will not choose a family get-together over a deadline at work or work crisis. If I lose the job, family cannot replace work.

It is work that pays your bills. As an adult, you cannot put that responsibility on family. Family shouldn't be the ones paying your children's fees or your rent. So tell me again the lesser value of work compared to family.

In many situations, there's no family without work.

Single parents lose their children because they have no money. Your love and wishes will not feed a child. It is work that clothes family in dignity.

It is quite lazy to refer to someone who chooses Work over playtime with family as a workaholic. You don't know the bills staring at him/her that require urgency and more hours of work. You don't know.

Choose work. Choose family too. 

I have no qualms telling my kids I will be working all week(end). No qualms and no guilt whatsoever. If I don't work, they don't eat. If I don't work, they don't go to good schools. If I don't work, they don't get to live this baby-girl life they have.

The term Workaholic is used mostly to make you feel guilty about your love for work. Is there anything like "Familyaholic"? People who just sit around the comfort of family without making any effort to build a personal life.

If I have to be at work on a weekend, I can never feel guilty.

And if I need some time to replenish after a season of work, I will not feel guilty. My me-time is just as important as my work.

Family will always be important. And when we say (that) Family is priority, what we means is: doing all we can to make family happy and comfortable. 

How do you make family comfortable? By working. Period.

There are exceptions, of course - chronic workaholics who do not monitor the phases and changes of family. That's an obsession to work. You should never be too busy to ask your child, "how are you doing?" Create easy communication with your loved ones.

Work gets no love because we all want to go on vacation forever with family. But who gets to pay the bills family accumulates? Duh!

So get on with your work. Earn your own self-worth. 

See you later... after work.
