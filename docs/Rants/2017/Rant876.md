That evening. A few years back. We were at the Galleria to celebrate something-I-cant-even-remember. We saw a movie. Then drinks. Then we took a walk hand-in-hand to my car.

The routine was to kiss for a few minutes in my car before heading to his. Always parked at the other end of the building for lack of space. 

It was barely 9pm. I was parked in a small dark corner along the road.

As we were busy sharing a good night kiss, three area boys appeared - one by my door, two by the passenger door.

Thankfully the doors were locked. 

The agbero by my side tried the door again, very frustrated, he hit the window and said, "Na God save you!"

Boyfriend was scared shitless. I was mad at their audacity. It just seemed so wrong. People were still walking in and out of The Galleria. The night was still young. Why should it ever be OK to be harassed when there's still so much life around that hour?

They walked away casually. Feeling like the baddest guys in town.

"Shit! That was close," Boyfriend was visibly shaken.

I just couldn't see why this should be OK. I mean, I am in my car kissing my boyfriend. Why should some smelly dirty bastards try to hurt us or steal from us?

So I pressed on my accelerator and I sped towards them. I wanted to knock one of them down.... watch the tyres roll over his body.

"No. No. No. No." Boyfriend screamed. "Joy. Shit. No!"

They heard the screeching sound and jumped out of my way. I actually saw one of them fly into the gutter dividing the lanes. 

"Fuck. Fuck." Boyfriend was sweating. "What was that about? You almost killed someone!"

"Imagine if the doors weren't locked," I said. "I didn't almost kill someone. I almost killed a wild beast. Big difference."

He wouldn't stop telling the tale to anyone who cared to listen.

Today in broad daylight. 5pm. Go slow. One retard bangs on my car window with all his cowardly might...

"Give us money."

I didn't even flinch. I legit didn't consider him bigger than a fly. I didn't as much as turn my head to acknowledge his presence. 

He was terribly ashamed of the zero effect his presence made. He slunk back into the crevice of cowardice.

This is my city, for pete sake! I refuse to be intimidated (in broad daylight especially) by hoodlums. And I cannot pretend to be afraid to satisfy the ego of any hooligan.

Toh.
