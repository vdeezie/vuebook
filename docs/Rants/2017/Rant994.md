I don’t know any Nigerian family that would deliberately sponsor rebellion.

But friends do. And not just any friend; friends who align with the ideals that drive you.

Family would want you to work out a bad marriage. We’ve seen it so many times. Her head is split in two, for instance, caused by a blow to the head and crushing of the skull on a wall by a lover. She’s bleeding and dying slowly, yet family will find a way to “settle the matter”. Because many families think first of Shame before Dignity. And most times, Dignity doesn’t even exist in their vocabulary. There’s Pride, but zero Dignity.

Pride is when the family is offended that an in-law didn’t ask to serve chicken drumsticks in mama’s already meat-filled plate of food when she visited.

Dignity, however, is ensuring family members' protect the basic rights of one another, and these rights are not denied or disrespected. Dignity strives to protect self-respect. Nigerian families think they know what self-respect is all about, but they don’t.

Families cover up paedophilia – they need to protect the “pride” of the family so “outsiders” do not mock them; they care nothing for the Dignity of a child molested in the family. Families cover up everything, or find an easier way out of tough issues – like settling some of the most tragic and devastating situations over kolanuts and Schnapps. At the end of the day, there’s laughter.

But a friend who connects with you on a deeper level of respect and instinct would most likely find more dignified ways of handling your issues.

I already know what family would say on almost everything. I mean, these are people I grew up with and spent the better part of my life listening to. I can hear the voice of my mother or my brother when I do something. 

But I am always curious and interested in what Seun, my friend, thinks.

Seun, for me, is the epitome of good friendship and I seek her advice on every major decision I have to make. And every time I call her to share a matter and she happens to align with my thoughts, I feel an overwhelming peace that is so hard to describe. I have given her some form of power to validate certain things I do. That power is mine to give, and I chose her.

She got back from the UK recently and went straight to my children’s school to give my kids gifts she bought for them, after calling me first, of course.

But I deviate, I was talking about experiencing peace. No disrespect to Clarins, I know it does a good job on my skin (hehehe); but my real beauty comes from my deliberate attempt to control my inner tranquility and most importantly, calculated effort to surround myself with people who GET me.

Seun gets me.

Tonight I called her again because I needed to make another major decision.

And all I can say is, I experienced peace yet again.

Thank you, friend.
