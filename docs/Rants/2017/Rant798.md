We were at The Police station earlier today to make a complaint, my lawyer and I.

There was another case at the station that caught my attention. I couldn't get the details, but all I gathered were angry words...

Standing window. Two hundred and seventy thaaaasand naira. Olori buruku. Ole. Window net. Useless man. Pay my money. 

It was hilarious. The woman was a class act. She was cautioned many times to keep the volume down. The Police officers in charge of the case were weary.

The female cop yawned after one full hour of chaos between the aggrieved woman and the artisan...

"This is a very simple matter. Why una bring am come police station for godsake." She was indeed weary, I would have gladly paid for a cold bottle of Coca-cola and her lunch.

The Police serves as consellors, pastors, accountants, judges, parents, siblings to ordinary Nigerians. 

They listen to every story with a straightface.

When we headed back to Evans' car, his tyres had been deflated. 

Why?

The new oga of the station says all cars parked near the wall should be deflated.

"It's a new order," one policeman said.

"But I parked here two days ago."

"De law, it's a new order."

End of story. 

We got a vulcaniser. 

One policeman said vulcaniser wasn't allowed into the premises. Then he said we had to pay before we drive off... for parking at a spot that demanded the deflation of the tyres.

Hian! 

I was scratching my head. 

He laughed and smiled. He was joking. But the sun was too hot, and neither Evans nor I was in the mood for humour.

I got impatient and went looking for a cab. 

Senior secondary school students walked by, and I heard...

"Are you wenting home?"

Wenting. 

Senior Secondary School. 

She had eye shades on. Low cut. After school lipstick on. Hips. Cheap perfume. 

I could tell she was sexually active, and having a lot of it. Too much sex.

I wanted to grab her and shake her until I could hear the sound of her brain hitting the sides of her head, like a stone in an empty Milo tin.

Evans was still upset that police, after seeing his bold "NBA" sticker on his car, would deflate his tyres.

Only a disgruntled police oga owed by the government would give that wicked instruction. 

Sigh.

In all my police cases, one thing is sure... Justice is for those who can afford it.

Justice is expensive.

And that is why the have-nots will forever be silenced. Because there's no justice for the poor.
