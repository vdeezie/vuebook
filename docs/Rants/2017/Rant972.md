The regular routine of a parent is to wake up by 5am to prepare the children for school. It’s still dark, you need a torch or you get to pull a generator. Breakfast is set before 6.10am if they are going to make the bus, then lunch is prepared separately and a bottle of juice or water.

In the blink of an eye, it’s 3 pm and school is over. There’s homework and all the annoying academic errands teachers expect you to carry out if at all your child will pass. 

“They said we should make Mandela from clay,” your child cries. 

This goes one for more than 10 years. Your direct supervision and heroic attention to detail. 

He has a running nose, a headache and he’s vomiting. You take him to the hospital, wait in line, see a doctor, and then you go home to follow through with the exact instructions of the medication.He may or may not improve. If not, you are back to the clinic - back and forth until he finally takes the all-important drip doctors love to give.

You make Mandela with clay. Cut Hillary out of a magazine and paste on a cardboard. Use the spikes of a bike to poke eyes into Trump, as instructed.

A week later he has pneumonia. I’m always stunned how many times children have pneumonia in tropical Nigeria. Then a cough that just wouldn’t let up. You realize, at say 34, you have no life of your own. 

The younger child sleeps for only a few hours at night. If you had the option of slicing off your left breast just for a few more hours of sleep, you would; a baby’s insomnia is nerve-racking and bloody annoying, there’s nothing cute about it. Not until he is a little older does it end, by then you are an owl – emotionally and physically.

And that’s just ONE child with a YOUNGER mother.

Enter an older woman with TWINS.

Life expectancy in Nigeria is 54. The average period a person may expect to live. In Britain, it’s 78 years. So it really irks me when we bring British/American standards to evaluate or buttress a Nigerian situation/discussion.

This is not an attempt to ridicule or dismiss people’s “blessings”, as we like to call it in Nigeria; it is an attempt to hold conversation which, unfortunately, is not a strong point for Nigerians. Everything is shrouded in “God’s blessings” and “Pepperdem”.

The typical older Nigerian from 55 to 75, do not have life insurance. The country is still burdened with poverty born out of half-baked education, buttered with religion. God is our life insurance policy. It can be assumed that there is no insurance that may see little children to a retired 57 year old woman through school. For some younger Nigerian mothers, we are daily on the grind to provide. Nigeria does not give the kind of luxury for scholarships. Children sponsored by Nigerian government have their placards on Linda Ikeji’s blog begging for Nigerians to “help them pay for tuition” as state government has neglected them in a foreign land after, say, two years. So the reality is you will have to dip your hand into your account to fund your child’s education from scratch. No handouts for you. And that account has to be nourished weekly or monthly to meet up with basic needs. There are no public schools in Nigeria. You do not have too much of a choice when it comes to doling out cash for basic education. How does a 57 year old woman with an even older husband do that?

If we say she will get help from relatives, do we suggest these relatives, who are obviously younger, do not have young families of their own? And do we now suggest nannies and maids, the same “evil” we have spent all our social media lives hauling over the coals are now sufficiently welcomed into the home? Do we bring them back strictly for the peculiar needs of a 57 year old woman?

The average Nigerian under-saves. They give more money to their pastors than they give to themselves. You will have to save 20% (or more) of your monthly income for decades to be able to maintain a lifestyle when you have retired. And that’s only if you earn an impressive sum. Third world is not just a tag Nigeria wears, a major determinant of third world living is not being able to maintain a lifestyle if you take your hands off the plough. We work right into our graves, and we are still always a few steps away from being broke. Only a small percent is exempted from this hand-to-mouth policy. Abroad, there are structures that allow you to dream taller. Nobody expects you to get a house or car with the full amount paid. It’s unreasonable! Society can only sustain a middle-class lifestyle when things are purchased on credit, with the price stretched into your future, else you will never be able to buy your dream house. That doesn’t happen in Nigeria. When it does, it is abused. In 2008 I started paying N45,000 monthly for a Honda City, after a year it doubled, after two years it became N110,000 monthly. I flung the car on their heads.

Are you waiting for government to bring milk to your door? Ten generations will pass and that will never happen for you here.

How about social security benefits? Do they exist for the poor Nigerian? Do not be tempted to tell me about an uncle who did it in Lekki. Pockets of civilization in the face of widespread neglect is not civilization.

There’s also the cost of caring for an aging body. Declining health for older people. Many of our parents are focused on dealing with osteoporosis, diabetes, respiratory disease, arthritis, heart disease, alzheimer’s disease, and the risk of falling from a stairs, in their sleep, wherever.

We do not get pregnant with the hope that someone else in the family or someone who can be paid should take care of our children. Why then do we have to have kids if we need “external help”?

When we cite examples of our mothers caring for our children as a valid reason for them to go ahead and have kids at old age, we forget that baby-sitting is so different from being the primary custodian of a child.

As far as they are a Nigerian couple, it wouldn’t be that they were busy building careers and didn’t have the time to get pregnant and have kids. No. They would have spent the last 25 years of a 27 year old marriage trying to get pregnant, not because it is necessary but because we expect that to be their major concern. This script has to be reenacted.

Now they have twins. Every reasonable society should be able to talk about it – how does society support children born by sexagenarians? Don't sweep things with your religious broom and expect it to go away. In a normal society, with the bolts screwed on right, nobody will approach a discussion like this with shit about “assuming the best” and fairy tale methods as tips for survival, citing spiritual possibilities of them living longer than a 20 year old, and all other hogwash about unexpected blessings and activities.

If a 25 year old mother dies before the 60 year old mother, that still doesn’t answer the HOW of older couples dealing with newborn twins in a society like Nigeria with no structure whatsoever for easy parenting or financial dependency. 

I'm tired of you people abeg.

Who wants to try out Pluto?
