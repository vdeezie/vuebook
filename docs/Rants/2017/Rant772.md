The children have been informed that the school will be introducing the almighty Cane at the gate for latecomers in 2017.

Stupid. Foolish. Senseless. 

I grew up frightened as a child... because there was this school at the main bus stop where students were flogged like slaves for coming late. You'd think they stole from the local government.

I had to pass that route everyday and I shuddered. It was criminal the way those teachers pounced on students. The screams and pleas. Reducing children to animals with no dignity.

I hated seeing that.

Yet we are here: Nigerian teachers and school authorities cannot find more effective ways of building children except through the cane.

It shows how very little we apply our brains to anything. To still have the same approach to discipline after all these decades of unsuccessful result is just sad. And lazy!

With all the flogging to stop children from getting to school by 8:01am... we are still the champions of latecomers in the world.

African Time. 

We are always late. In other words, the beastly flogging we received- from Babyboomers to Generation X and Y and Millenials, was for nothing!

Our events do not start on time. We are late to meetings, late to seminars, late to funerals. And we are thoroughly unapologetic about that. 

In other climes, where children are not whipped for being late or for anything for that matter...

They are always on time. 

Sometimes you wonder...

Do we all have coconut heads? Is there not one person in this country with a thinking head?

You run a school in this era, and your 2017 solution to latecomers is a re-introduction of the method that didn't work during your own time or during any generation. 

"African Time" is there to remind us that flogging a child early in the morning for being 5minutes to 30minutes late is a stupid, daft idea.

Daft, I say!
