That was how, last week, police caught up with me on Ozumba Mbadiwe traffic, as I was heading to Lekki.

I think I beat the traffic light.

It was yellow, I swear it. 

Maybe not *scratches head*

So they pawawawawa in their cool (power) bike and flagged me to the side.

Only me one. All this attention. Hian!

So I pulled over.

“Madam, you missed the light.”

“No, I didn’t.”

“Yes, you did.”

“No, I didn’t.”

"You are a journalist. You should obey the law.”

“But I didn’t miss the light.”

“You did.”

“I didn’t.”

“Madam just confess –“

“Confess what? Are you a priest? I am not admitting to something I didn’t do.”

“You missed it.”

“I did not.”

“OK. GO!”

Silence… ah! Just like that? Go ke. I refused to go oh.

“Madam, go nah.”

“Why?”

“Ahn ahn! You don’t want to go? You said you didn’t miss the light. Fine. GO!”

Then I thought if indeed… maybe… by accident… I… well… could have beat the light *scratches eye*

“What do you want me to do?”

“Madam, I say go. No wahala.”

“Um… I swear I didn't miss the light. It was yellow and –“

“We have heard. You can go.”

I wanted to ask if I could buy them late lunch, or som'tin. Not sure why that crossed my mind. I still refused to go sha.

“-Because I don’t want you to think I missed the light and I am giving you a tough time," I grumbled.

One of them started laughing.

“It’s ok. You can go. No tough time. Bye bye.”

“Ok. You are sure?”

“Yes.”

“Thank you.”

I drove off.
