So a white woman comes to Nigeria, saves a child abandoned by his parents to die after the "word of the lord" revealed to them through a bloody pastor that he is a witch, therefore the reason for the family's misfortune..

The little boy, named Hope, is fed, cared for and loved by the white woman.

Few years later, here is Hope. He is in school, he is healthy, happy and has a bright future ahead of him.

Nigerians, a religious people, who have busied their brains with the task of defending tithing, couldn't save their own child - a citizen of their own country.  

It took a white, probably atheist, woman with tattoos all over her body to save a Nigerian child. 

Now Nigerians - a group of god worshipping neanderthals, are praying to a god to bless the white woman. 

Can you smell this stinking irony?

Your religion sentenced him to death, but Love rescued him.

You people don't know God. 

You will all go to hell. You and your pastors. 

When you think about it: what really do pastors in Nigeria do apart from buying nice cars and assisting women in, err, getting "the fruit of the womb"? Only for these women to brand the child a witch. 

Don't answer that question. I don't care.

PS: Say hello to Hope.
