Because I have tried to shake things off, yet they remain. They torment me, they tear me apart.

I have tried to be like everyone else. To find absolute happiness wearing an asoebi and dancing around in circles whilst we cheer the 28,000,000th woman getting married.

I have tried to be satisfied with the love of family and the all-consuming love from a man.

But I am not satisfied. 

I have not been able to function since I listened to the Governor of Oyo State ridicule and humiliate tertiary students of Nigeria. I cannot function. Not even the love of a man that is expected to solve all Nigerian women problem can soothe me.

I am troubled. I sleep and I have nightmares. I wake and there are pictures of a gloom Nigeria in my head, tormenting me.

I don't even know how you all carry on talking gleefully about sex and marriage and wedding and babies.

I don't understand how we can all trivialise this Nigerian tragedy with endless discussions on bride price et al. 

Are you aware we have no country because it is being stolen piece by piece for the last 30+ years?

The one thing I never want to be is hopeless. I am never good with hopelessness. I tear out my hair. I sit in a corner and hit the wall.

But you see, I have a really cute lovely life. Some will say I am truly blessed. I love the office I go to everyday. That office treats me like royalty. I have bright kids. Great family. Badass support from mummy and brother. 

I have love. Men take me seriously. My man takes me very seriously. Saves me everyday. Call me Cinderella.

But it is not enough apparently. I am troubled.

Everytime something happens... my heart grips me.

Do something.

The chibok girls. I was having a decent meal, that grip... "do something". Fuck it, I just want to eat. But the pain in my soul never stops.

Do something.

What can I do? I have no powers. I'm just a writer.

Do something. 

That we live like "normal people", talking like normal people do in societies where they have basic working facilities is the real tragedy.

We are not, by any measure, normal people. We are disadvantaged people.

Speak like you are disadvantaged. You can't be having regular normal conversations like you have a country when, in actual fact, you live in the middle of nowhere, with no security. 

Speak to your disadvantaged position. Everyday.

Today I have cried myself blue. Our future is on my mind. 

These people. These leaders. They don't care about us.

What will I say to my children when they ask me: "What did you do?"

Someone took the time to put side-by-side an Obama's reaction to a rebellious student gathering, and that catastrophe of a speech by Oyo state governor... Again I tore up in pieces, hitting my hand on a wall. Wailing. 

I don't take humiliation well especially from anyone whom I believe works with privileges.

These leaders should be stopped. We should demand for our own future.

I am tired of writing.

There's nothing more to write, Pius Adesanmi has written 'em all. There's no political site that can be more caustic than Sahara, Cable or Premium Times.

There's no tweet left to be tweeted, Omojuwa has done that shit. 

I want to go on the streets. I want to gather thousands of Nigerians and roar so our angst can wake the dead and the conscience of the living.

I want a committee. A think-tank group. I want financiers. I want writers who can get the pieces on international platforms. I want angry Nigerians.

I want to get out of social media more often. 

I want to start a Social Movement. 

If I don't I won't truly be satisfied. 

These people destroying our future are not here on Facebook. Their children are on Instagram posting rich and fabulous pictures.

Nigeria hurts me. And I am tired of being a victim. 

We have to fix this country.

If you'll like to be part of this social movement, please send me an inbox message.

And if you don't, I'll do it myself.

PS: Remember this Facebook post on Sunday, January 15, 2017... is the start of The Nigerian Revolution. 

Thank you.
