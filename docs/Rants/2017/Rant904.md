The Mind of a Murderer is a series on C & I

A criminal psychologist visits murderers and serial killers in prison to engage them in conversation for the benefit of society.

A typical conversation will address his childhood; his highpoints as a child growing up in, say, Kentucky. His low points too. How he was raised and treated by his parents. Any accidents? What teenage life was like. Which drugs were sampled. How well he did in school. Social scene. Girlfriends. Jobs. Trips.

Gradually it heightens after 20 minutes of light conversation to his first instincts to kill. His many thoughts of killing, to the first killing. What were the obvious triggers etc.

Yesterday featured one killer with schizophrenia. He hears voices, as loud as one speaking to him in reality.

These voices tell him to kill. They badger him. Taunt him. Wake him up from sleep to remind him about killing.

He fought the urges for years. Migraine. Constant frustrations. Finally he killed someone. This was triggered by a failed relationship. He went to a bar to drink away his pain; met a woman, an alcoholic, who desperately wanted his attention. When they were finally alone, the voices came on stronger: she is going to tell the police about what you plan to do... you have to kill her... kill her... kill her... don’t let her get away... she’s a spy...

So he did. Five stab wounds to her throat. Then he sliced her throat.

The same voices would start to haunt him again. Mock him. Laugh at him. Telling him he’ll be caught.

Look what you did... your life is over... they are going to get you....

All in his head. 

It is a mental illness. It is Schizophrenia.

They take drugs for these things. It is a medical condition.

The brain of a patient is quite different from the normal brain. The doctor explains this to the camera so people can understand these things and know what to do or how to react or seek help if they have someone with chronic mood swings and depression.

I am not a doctor, so there’s a limit to how I can speak confidently about it. But I am not ignorant to believe a witch from a goat entered someone and took over his brain. Or an old woman in the village haunted someone to Lagos to “finish his life”.

-Because American TV constantly engages in conversation, I am no longer a primitive human stuck in a third world country without electricity. Keep your electricity, my mind will light up my world.

For this ability to exchange intellectually, I see the world better than I used to.

America engages serial killers. Think about that.

Here, in Nigeria, we don’t even engage our children. Everywhere you turn, your right to engage is rebuked, scoffed.

Schools are not engaging parents enough. Parents are not engaging children. Local government is not engaging the residents. Residents do not engage one another. When they come together, they flood the conversation with “as a born again Christian, you must –“ all the way to penury. Conversations that produce nothing, just a floating feeling of ascending to heaven, then with a loud thud back to earth, back to reality. Problems still there, unsolved.

If at all there is any engagement, there’s the unspoken rule not to speak out or go against a certain level of comfort, so people don’t feel threatened by the stark realities. And if you are stubborn enough to speak regardless, the heavy situations that will require more research or scrutiny, is quickly passed on to a higher being – a God, and everyone is told, cautioned even, to wait on Him. These things happen even in secular circumstances.

For instance, people don’t like Jason Njoku, the very successful, very accomplished CEO of Iroko TV. You know why? Because Jason asks the tough questions. He demands engagement ALWAYS! And Nigerians are uncomfortable with people who dare to ask or confront issues; they’ll rather live in the celestial realm for Angel Gabriel to fix.

They can’t stand him because he isn’t acting like the typical rich Nigerian who sucks all the wealth he can in Nigeria and keeps mute. He tries to expose the problems with working in Nigeria or doing business with Nigerians or our misconception about many other things. He tells you the step by step process of the things he has succeeded in doing and the ones he failed at. We expect certain people to just be rich in peace and allow our poverty to ferment without trying to share knowledge or ask for an exchange of intellectual property.

The minute Dangote tries to empower us, we will despise him. We love madam Alakija because the only thing she says about wealth is “How to trust God” and “How to submit to your husband”. With that, all is well with the world.

We are a wonderful people, I tell you. Wonder as a thing of extraordinary mortification.#Rant904
