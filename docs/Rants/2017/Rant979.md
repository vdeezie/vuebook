# Rant979


October 19, 2017

First you have to be sure he has no social media presence. Remember, less than 12 mutual friends. He can’t be religious. He shouldn’t be calling any pastor “daddy” “papa” “father”. Taking advice from someone led by his own spiritual greed is a turn-off. He should never ever weave a conversation around “God said”.

He shouldn’t be obsessed with women – always yapping about what’s good for women, what’s not. And he definitely shouldn’t see women as lower or higher than a man. I hate men who patronize women with “pains of childbearing”, “love her before she has breast cancer and die”, “love her because womanhood is a pile of sufferation” kind of rant by a man makes me want to puke. 

No exquisitely trimmed beard, please! That shit gets on my nerves. Hair shouldn’t be perfectly cut like TeeBillz, I can’t stand it. Be very aware of your status as a king in a world where your gender commands respect and allows you to flourish. Be kind, be gentle, be rich. You have no right to be broke. You can’t be arguing and e-fighting with a woman on social media. You can’t be in a clique! Dear lord, fuck out of here with that cliquey nonsense; baritone gossiping like a squirrel, shameless preek. 

You should never suck another man’s dick on social media. No no no. No slave boi mentality. Get out, you rat! Have a mind of your own. 

If you pass the e-test, then let’s step into reality.

You've got to spill some work nugget, stories, experiences, career secrets - stuff like that. Knowledge is a turn-on. Don't just sit there and be twiddling your thumb. 

I’m chilling with someone and I realize he’s just sitting there doing nothing, looking at the wall, waiting for sex. No nah. You have to be busy oh. You have to be on a computer working, let me come to you and kiss your neck. Or take a book and read or something. Sex has to happen along the way, it’s not going to be programmed into your zero activity ass. I don’t like men who aren’t working. Work, damn it! 

What else? Then conversation. It takes 30 minutes to conclude you are not-so-bright. And there’s nothing like “he isn’t bright but his D is amazing.”

Nah! I don’t believe in that mess. You have to be bright and smart, otherwise I don't care what's down there. 

Try not to care so much about your beard. No clean-cut nonsense. No obsession with your reflection. And you have to be confident. And you must appreciate the gender issues we talk about from a position that protects your own beliefs. No forming accent. Be proud of your Yoruba intonation. I like it. 

You should never be tempted to cheat an agbero on the road. Don't be fighting over N100 for parking space. What is wrong with you? Many things on Lagos streetz should be beneath you in a humbling way. 

You're king. You have no right to be bitter. Your anger should last only a minute. Know your power, let it humble you.

And you don’t get to be a baby boy. I don’t nurture men. I don’t borrow men money. That is why you have to be rich, because I want lovely gifts and stuffsssssss.

But when you check all these boxes, you have nothing left.

That is why we are celibate. But I know my God will bring my Yoruba man to me in due season. But it's best you come quickly because I am a very fine, hot woman now.

Note: Do not deter if you are not Yoruba. The word simply represents any man who is amazing, all tribes may be considered, but it totally excludes a particular tribe sha.
