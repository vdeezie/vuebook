I just watched one of the most heartrending Crime and Investigation real-life episodes.

A 17 year old white girl in upper-class white society started dating an 18 year old black boy in a poor neighbourhood. They met on Facebook. They were into each other and spent hours together every day. The girl's family accepted the boy after two months; three months into their relationship, the boy introduced her to his mother.

7 months later, she clocked 18 and they went to a party.

A few hours afterwards, the white girl (let's call her Peggy) was stabbed. It was horrific. Thankfully, she survived. But there was more to come.

A week later, the parents were stabbed in their home. They weren't so lucky, they died.

American police dug right into it, asking questions and inviting peeps from the black neighbourhood to give any tip. No luck. 

The boyfriend (let's call him Shawn) claimed that it was gang-related  as he was owing money to a ruthless gang and they wanted to get back at him by hurting his girlfriend and killing her parents.

After intense investigation, the truth finally came out - wait for this...

It was actually Shawn himself who stabbed his girlfriend and murdered her parents.

Why?

At the party, he had wanted to have sex in the car, she said No. He was furious and he stabbed her 13 times - on her forehead and her neck. Then he told her that he did it out of love, so they still need to be together, and the only way he can jump charges would be if she lies to the police that it was done by someone else. So she lied.

If she thought the worst was over, she was wrong. 

A week later after her attack, her parents were bludgeoned to death with a hammer. It was gruesome and beyond cruel.

Their deaths will forever be her burden to carry because she protected her boyfriend from facing charges for stabbing her multiple times. If he was in custody for her stab wounds, then he wouldn't have attacked her parents, and they'd still be alive.  

Shawn is sentenced to death. I hope he dies a slow painful death. He is a monster.

An entire family was destroyed because one member was entangled in a wrong/bad association.

Everything that we are is based on the people we associate with. Yet many people treat relationships and associations flippantly, letting just about any kind of person into their sanctutay. It's self-hate.

People ruin people. Be careful how you throw caution to the wind.

I watched an episode where the lover of a single mother got mad and jealous when she wanted to end the relationship (after months of abuse); he stabbed her two sons - killed one and paralysed the other. 

The son that survived told her "you brought this on us". But it's TV so he had to add, "but I forgive you."

It's frightening when you think of how relationships can either build or destroy you. 

Peggy's family would still be alive if she didn't let a beast into their lives.

I am going to draw a map, for my daughters, describing how association can ruin lives and families when they wake up. So many mistakes are avoidable. 

But it's 1:48am now. So, good night.
