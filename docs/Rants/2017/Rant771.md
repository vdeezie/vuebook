Let us make one thing clear:

You cannot make a feminist out of a husband. 

You can only share information, and hope that his head and heart are big enough to let new knowledge brew.

In that case, he is already a feminist. Albeit in a state of  dormancy, waiting for a trigger.

The same approach can be used by different women and will have different results. 

"Dahling, I need to get another degree. It makes no sense that I have to sit at home all day. I want to grow, I want to learn, I want more to life..."

That statement will come with one hundred million type of responses.

It may come with a slap, a resounding "no", an offensive stare, an argument that will last all through the growing years of your children...

OR it may come with a "Yes, sure. I agree with you."

It is partly your success. The sheer luck of marrying someone who actually allows his heart grow as big as the world is able to renew, discard information.

But it is mainly his WILL to adjust to new knowledge and new ways.

A man is already a quiescent feminist before he allows himself to live out the realities of feminism.

I know women who were summoned by an entire village just for demanding certain rights to further certain interests.

And I know husbands who shield their women from social/cultural humiliation when they make these same demands.

When we decide to applaud certain victories, stirring the bellies of many women...

Remember to write a caveat:

"Do not try this at home."

I'll give you an instance:

My mother told me the story of a woman who got "permission" from her husband to run a course in Europe. She pleaded, cooked, sexed, lectured, prayed, shared her vision to get him to understand she had rights, human rights she would like to explore in academics.

He said "Yes, go and be great." 

It was a bait.

When she got back. She was dragged to the village. Questioned like a thief. Bullied and mocked. 

And was informed that a more suitable wife had taken her place. 

She was distraught. This was a man who told her it was OK. 

He was never a feminist. He never believed in equality. He got fed up with the constant "harassment". That seed didn't grow. There was no dormant feminism seed inside of that man, so no matter what she did or said... she could never make him the man he had to be in an evolving world.

Some other men will keep their word. And support their women. Not because she is such an orator or the sex was mind blowing that it actually did a reset of his brain...

The only reason a man agrees to equal gender opportunities is because he is indeed a Feminist. 

Period.

So Nigerian wives, don't get too excited.

Read what you see on Facebook...

But, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.
