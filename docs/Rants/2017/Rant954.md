# Rant954


September 14, 2017

I watched “A Family Man” featuring Gerard Butler last week. There’s a scene in the movie where a man finally got a job. He’d been searching for one for a long time, he signed on to an agent who finally called one day and told him, “You got the job.” It took a while, but here he was – finally employed.

His wife was so elated, she hugged and kissed his cheek…because they had waited so long for this. But he was calm and was telling her not to cry, that it wasn’t such a big deal. “I knew I’d get it eventually,” he said.

His circumstances were special because he was an older man, still looking to be employed.

Then something happened. He told his wife he was going to use the restroom. He went upstairs… I had no clue what he was about to do, so I asked my movie partner: “Where is he going?”

And he said, “He is going to cry.”

Indeed, he was. The man locked himself in the restroom, turned the tap on - to drench the sound of his tears… and he sat there and cried like a baby. That was one out of the two most powerful scenes in that movie. 

Something similar happened to me yesterday.

I’m not looking for any 9-to-5 job, so mine is a bit different.

It’s about a filmmaker, probably one of the nicest I ever work with… I shared a story for a TV series with her. She invited me over to her office for a few questions, as always. She liked the idea. She paid the entire fee right on the spot, and told me to get it done.

But I’ve written a movie script for her many months ago. She liked it “very much”. 

Then she buzzed me a few weeks ago to turn one of my rants to a short film, she was going to shoot almost immediately. She paid. I wrote it as a short film. She said it was “OK”.

“Like it very much” and “OK” are cute compliments. I was working towards something better. And for her kind honesty, I knew when I did something phenomenal, she would say exactly that.

So I went into writing the TV series, she had approved and paid for, with the determination of Natalie Portman in Black Swan –  a single-minded ambition, resolute to give her best performance, even if she bled to death doing it.

I sat on my bed for seven days. The only time I stood up was to prepare food for my kids. I told my freelance cook to make me a bowl of fried chicken as snack (so I don’t feel hungry enough to care for proper meals). I chewed fried chicken until fried chicken tasted like saw dust. I picked only a few calls. I cancelled all meetings. I shared only a few words with my kids. I worked hard on the tone and dialogue and intrigue of the script.

Yes, she had paid me every dime upfront. But at that moment, it wasn’t just about money. I wanted more.

I was starting on a new project with Vivian (WahalaNow), and I was writing a script that I believed should define me. I was working like a beast. 

Seven days later, I have six episodes whipped from sweat. Seven more episodes to go, but I wanted her feedback, so I asked if I could send half the work done so far. It also allows me to catch a break and watch some TV – for inspiration.

I sent it by midnight.

The next morning, by 6.30am, I got a text, and it said…

“Hi Joy. One word for this script – BRILLIANT. Let me know if you are up so I can ask a few questions. Well done.”

I read it immediately I got it. I looked at the word, “Brilliant” for ten full minutes. I stood up, went to my window and just looked at a new day. I stood there for 20 minutes. I exhaled.

And yes, I cried. God! It felt good.

You may not understand, but for this one script, I wasn’t going to be satisfied with a good cheque. I wanted more – I wanted validation. It was why I worked so hard. I wanted professional respect as a writer (not that she ever disrespected me. She has always been extremely courteous and amazing). I wanted to be first-to-call when she needed any screenplay done, and I knew I wasn’t going to get that kind of treatment writing scripts that she “liked” or scripts that were “ok”.

It had to be “brilliant”. It had to be! 
(err, someday, “phenomenal” will fall on me. Until then “Brilliant is fine. LOL!)

And for writing a brilliant script, she is paying for a second season.

PS: I think I changed over the last few weeks. I can’t feel my hands. My mind works in a different way. And the last strands of empathy are gone. I have become some kind of machine.

And I like it.

Regards.
