"If you had a mum like you, you'd be so great, mummy."

"Really?"

"Yes, you'd be out-of-this-world great."

"Wow. Thanks. Where is that coming from?"

"It's just the truth."  

"But my mum is amazing."

"I know. I know. Grandma is amazing. But if you had a mother like you, you'd be so great."

"OK. That means I'll be expecting you to be very great then."

"I'll try."

Then Jolly chips in: "I don't want to be pressured to be great, please."
