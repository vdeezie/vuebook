Nwankpa, chief coach Nigerian Boxing Team, told Anthony Joshua when he turned him down in 2008...

"If you are that good, go and fight for Britain nah." (paraphrased)

You know that is how we talk, right? Especially when we have some authority over others.

"If you are so smart, how come you never marry?"

"If you are that good, why are you working here?"

"If you sabi the work, why you never start your own business."

"All your English never buy you aeroplane?"

"Where is your God nah, as you dey suffer like this?"

"If you nor be witch, why you never born?"

"Shebi you get sharp mouth, your husband never beat you?"

"As you ugly like this, how you nor go be feminist?"

"If Nigeria taya you, go abroad nah."

"You too big to beg, abi? I go make sure say you suffer for this place."

"My frien' comot dat motor for road. Nor be your mate dey fly private jet!"

At my former apartment, sharing a corridor with the next apartment was the most annoying, most uncomfortable, most intrusive experience of my life. Everyday I cringed. For an introvert, it was tough. The constant noise and human presence that was none of my making. I hated it.

I would grumble, break out in rashes, and suffer mood swings... because I wanted to control the number of humans I came in contact with, which would be nil. I wanted none of it. I had no privileges to make people dissappear. It was even tough to do the daily rituals of "good morning". 

One time, grumbling about the noise, wishing for silence under my guts, whilst I tried to read and meditate... one of their visitors said in Yoruba:

"She wants silence? Let her move to Ikoyi nah." ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I still haven't moved to Ikoyi oh. But I finally have my own corridor!!! And plenty apartment space. I don't have to pull the curtains because someone from the other apartment is walking by. I can cook naked. And write commissioned scripts in only my lingerie *woot!

That's my own Anthony Joshua moment oh. Oya shout "Alleluia!" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒðŸ’ƒ
