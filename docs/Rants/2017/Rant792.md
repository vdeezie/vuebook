In Jolade's homework today...

If unmarried *sic* young lady becomes pregnant, she should consult her:

A) Native doctor 
B) Parents
C) Friend 
D) Teacher
E) Brother 

Guess what Jolade chose: NATIVE DOCTOR. 

She was quite confident; she rolled her eyes in absolute conviction.

"It is native doctor nah. He will tell her what to do with the pregnancy."

Ife and I laughed until real tears clouded our vision. 

Nollywood (in grandma's house apparently) has finished my baby.

PS: The answer should be "a doctor", which isn't even an option here, but let's move on.

On a serious note, this book is a disgrace! 

Ugo C. Ugo is a big fat book of idiotic proportions. 

The mistakes. The sheer silly mistakes! Bad bad English! The author obviously translated Igbo to English without the decency of proofreading or editing.

"The best part of finishing grade six, is leaving this stupid book behind," Ife said. "Mummy, if you read the English in this book, you'll strangle someone, trust me."

That's an 11 year old complaining about the text she had to read all through grade six. 

Tonight, as we read from Jolade's book (she is now in grade six), we threw our bodies on the floor laughing at bad bad sentence construction. 

Sigh.

Parents, buy books for your children to read. The best books are international fiction books; they invest in good sentences, well crafted, delivered with the fear of the English God.

Buy modern classics by Jacqueline Wilson. Buy The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. The Secret Garden. A Little Princess by Frances Burnett Hodgson...

Buy The Little House on the Prairie series. Goodnight Mr. Tom - for older children. 

Get My Naughty Little Sister series and The  Paddington Bear series are both hilarious for little girls. Invest in Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfield. 

Buy the Enid Byton series, all 100+ books.

This collection was put together for me by the great Aduke Gomez. Thank you, sis.

Parents, buy. Buy. Buy.

I plan to get all these books for my girls.

When you need to buy an extra shoe, buy a book instead. When you need to load data on their phone, buy a novel instead. When you need to subscribe to DSTV, throw that card away and buy a book for your child instead.

The shit they teach them in school is what it is- shit! Shit from texts books like Ugo C. Ugo.

If you want a confident child, get him/her to read like it is the most fashionable thing there is.  Let them gulp literature until they become pompous and annoying.

Yes!

Save the child from the woe of Nigerian education.
