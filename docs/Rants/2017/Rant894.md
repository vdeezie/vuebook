# Rant894

We can continue complaining about poor communication OR we can do something about it.

I am appalled by how Nigerians communicate. It’s a lack of intelligence, really. And a defence. If you can’t respond intelligently and stay within the context of the debate, you can make an intelligent choice by walking away from the entire discussion.

Putting your lips in someone’s vagina and monitoring their menstrual cycle or calculating the hour to their menopause is not the way to respond to anything. 

I have over 31,000 followers and 2,200+ friends. There’s no way I am going to find any hate post about me. Social media is a snob. If you do not want to find anything on this space about you, you won’t find a thing.

I don't see a thing.

I haven’t read a hate post about me in the last three years. I'm serious. I don’t read personal blogs of people who can’t write. I know there are many people like that who take their little hate fest to olodo.blogspot.com. If it isn’t poetry or essays or beautiful love stories about finding self (like what Ucheoma writes) I will NEVER click on your shit. Ever.

I have over 30 novels that I have to read. I haven't read all the bookmarked essays waiting to be devoured, and newyorker's latest brilliant report or article is always calling on me with open arms... you really think your blog shit is worth a second of my attention? That's never going to happen.

That’s the beauty of online living.

My entire online lifestyle, regardless of the number of people who follow me, revolves around less than 20 people. 

I can count them easily: Temidayo, Bola Awe, Olaide Akin, Idem Paragon, Teetee, Kacii, Olafisayo, Omolara, Esosa, Evans, Farida, Lami Mabel, Prisca, Olutoyosi Omotoso, Maureen, Mariam and a few others. That’s about it. Anything I do not find on those walls, will pass me by easily.

I am, after all, a narcissist. We don’t go snooping for what will complete us. We are complete. Exaggeratedly so.

The only hate post I read, which was published on Ynaija, I am going to do something about it.

Because we cannot continue ranting on Facebook without actually doing anything about what we rant about. If the constitution draws out certain cyber situations likely to attract the authorities, it is your duty to find out how far you can verify the law. Get the police involved, be CURIOUS enough to know what the Police can do. If at the end you are told it doesn’t hold water, at least you did something. You started something. It's the least you owe to your children who may get a phone and data soon. You must make them understand that there is nothing cool about being an idiot. Articulate your points intelligently and move on.

We  engage the authorities not because we are afraid. We engage them because we are curious to know if at all these situations can get a police cyber restriction or be addressed in court. Or justice of some sort can be achieved.

I don’t appreciate being told to “let it go”. Nigerians are always letting things go. That is how we ended up here. Abroad, people go to court for $200; a scratch on a car; a neighbour’s threat; the colleague’s dog eating the cat. Any damn reason. Let the court throw it out, at least you did what you wanted to do. Because the other alternative to justice could be a crime.

If we complain about the appalling way we communicate, and there are parts of the constitution that corroborates with our issues, then use the constitution.

It will take another five to ten years to be able to throw someone in jail for poor language or threat on social media, but if you don’t start testing the law now… it’ll take longer to nip this trend.

I don’t mind being a frontrunner in this experiment. Many young men, especially, should be invited to the station. 

Half the teenagers that attended the “Talk to Boys” seminar I organised are on social media. They are friends to these overzealous 20-soemthing year olds who can’t wait to talk about a woman’s vagina when debates as far-reaching as religion or politics are on the table. They lack sense, these men, so the easiest thing is to try to shame any woman who looks a whole lot better than their mothers. 

If we want to correct this shit behaviour and protect teen boys from inheriting this method of communication, then we have to drag these men to court. Find just ONE word or phrase or sentence that backs your right in the constitution. You will get a lot of backlash but that wouldn’t be new, would it? It would only be a continuance of scum and leftovers.

Our children will be on social media soon. Do we really want them to think this is the best way to communicate? When a 15 year old questions religion, for instance… do you think it is proper to have a boy tell her she needs to focus on her menopause in another 40 years?

*scratches head* 

If ONE teacher at Falomo school had nipped the culture of graduating boys sexually harassing graduating girls from the neighbouring school... do you think we would have to deal with these monsters assaulting students in broad daylight in 2017?

I don’t think so.

Connect the dots.
