At last count, The Nigerian Revolution has 148 members. 

I was hoping for 100 by the end of the week, but here we are!

For a social movement, numbers are really good and important.

We are dealing with a system with no respect for us. None whatsoever.

A school has been closed down for 8 months. Bombs just go off at refugee camps. Children abducted from schools. Families destroyed by herdsmen. Prices of everything on the increase. The list of woes is endless.  

Where there are 170+million people in an under-developed space, we will have problems of this kind...

But the question is: what is the penalty or retribution for these crimes and/or "mistakes"?

None. No one is made to take responsibility for the patches of rot in the various social/political establishments in Nigeria.

A bomb goes off and Nigerians say, "mistakes happen."

And that is it. 

This is our life. A life of many mistakes and no justice.

You are a mistake then. All of us. Because a security agent can kill you and it would be recorded as a mistake.

Oh! And the famous word: "Forgive." Followed by "God knows best."

And life, as we know it, continues with scores of blatant corruption and impudence.

But I deviate.

I was talking about the numbers we have gathered in just 48+ hours. 

One hundred and forty eight members.

I am hoping that we can get sponsors from the numbers we have.

We need to hold our first meeting. And there'll be other meetings. And when we finally decide on a course, there'll always be need for financial support. 

If you can sponsor our first gathering do kindly send a message via inbox. I read all messages.

Do kindly contribute what you can for the start of the Movement. 

This may be the best errand you'll send your money to run.

Thank you.
