My daughter got an invitation from school to be present at a book launch. 

A 13 year old from only god-knows-where is launching her short stories.

I read the letter of invitation. It stated that Ife was selected to this event for her creativity and smarts. 

Like everything Nigeria, I doubted the authenticity of this invite. Is this really about the children or more for the entertainment of adults?

But she wanted to go. And I didn't see why I should stand in her way. 

"You are going to fill up empty chairs and fulfil an obligation your school probably has with the parents and/or institution of this young author."

She shrugged. And I prayed, for once, I'd be proven wrong.

I picked her up from school only a minute ago...

"How did it go?" I asked.

The 13 year old author launched her book alright. Five short stories.

She didn't hold conversations with the children. She didn't read the stories. The guests didn't ask questions about the book or query the content of the book.

My predictions were true. Ife was in full school regalia on a Saturday morning just to fill up an empty seat in a hall with other "chosen" students.

After 5 hours away from home, she came back and couldn't tell one thing she enjoyed at the event, apart from gisting with her fellow "chosen" schoolmates.

"So where is the book?" I asked 

She wasn't given a copy of the book. The event was a typical book launch where adults throw in figures.

Taartie thasaaaand! Going! Going!!!

Fifty thasaaaand! Going! Gone!!

No intellectual conversation or review of the book.

Why then did they need children at the event?

Sigh.

They have already started building our kids to be as stupid as we are.

We have made our children convenient accessories like flowers by the side of a porch; like jewellery on our necks; like the extra tyre in our trunks. 

I didn't want to tell her I told you so.

"Until you leave Nigeria, you will never understand how much you have been short changed by your country," I said.

It is unfair.
