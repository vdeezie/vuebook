10 good decisions I made this year:

1). Cut my hair.

2). Okafor Law-ed an Ex.

3). Moved houses (bigger space).

4). Changed jobs.

5). Scriptwriting.

6). Changed children's school (whew!!!).

7). Cut off more people from my space. Yas!

8). Sustained beautiful friendships with girls like Teetee and Bola. Always sending me gifts. Then Seun and Olafisayo, full of great advice.

9). I was going to head to Houston a few weeks before the Hurricane started. Called Vivian. But had to cancel because of work schedule. I'd have been caught in the middle of it. 

10). Watched Game of Thrones.
