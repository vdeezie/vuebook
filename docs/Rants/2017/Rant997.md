I am a primary provider.

I am the one who ensures her family of two little girls get good education, feed well, have a wardrobe full of clothes, and gadgets for knowledge and entertainment. I am the one who makes all the decisions regarding this family.

If I am out of the picture, everything changes. 

I think only as a primary provider. 

Anything that makes me lose money is an enemy. 

Invest, yes. I  invest in the lives of my children. So yes to that. 

But financially irresponsible lovers, friends or acquaintances are things that I detest. And there's no oxygen in my personal space to make their habits flourish. 

Many people don't think like primary providers. It is why they focus on the reaction/consequences of the incident.

All I can think of is... What?!!! She used my car repair funds for weave and bleaching cream???

It's a car, let her push it. But his money for car repairs is sitting on that woman's head as a weave. That must hurt. That must really hurt.

My condolences to the man.
