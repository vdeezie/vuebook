I am very suspicious of people who drag God into decisions that favour personal biases.

I don't respect prophets, I don't respect pastors who claim God as a personal accessory on their wrists... something they twist to meet a kind of trend or greed.

I do not respect neighbours, colleagues, friends who bully in the name of God. 

I've had people stomp their feet and slap their hands on concrete floors to state that, "you will move out of this apartment BY THE GRACE OF GOD."

Yawn!

You see, poverty thinks with its anus. The mentally poor are a disgrace to themselves. 

Of course I should leave a fucking rented apartment. I should leave and get my own bungalow! 

Duh!

People who intimidate others by calling on a god to fight on their behalf are a sham. Laughable, stupid. Even God is ashamed of them.

It's a silly Nigerian right to claim God for yourself; rant about him speaking to you privately about the state of your neighbour's marital life, or your colleague's health, or the state of the nation. But this God never gets to tell you how stupid you are, and how you need to check your bad debts and fix your shit. No.

All your god does is gossip with you about your neighbour's life, while your own life is stagnant and ordinary.

Your aproko god is blind to your own shame. What a wawu!

It is all bull crap. Your greed, your heart or your need speak to you. Not God. Period.

And there's nothing wrong with that, really.

Be a local or national "fraud". But leave God out of it.

Leave God out of your daily bad choices and profound nonsense. 

Build, fall, rise, fail, try again, win or lose. Whatever. Do it with the honour of your own bloody desire to be the best or the crappiest. 

God didn't send you on any errand. 

If your heart desires a change in your community for instance, it is your heart that is unsteady about the injustices of that community. Respond to your heart. Pray about it if you must, ultimately it remains your decision. God is not in the business of dragging anyone by the arm to get things done.

Don't delude yourself.

And that brings me to this issue of God endorsing Buhari from the lips of some rather comfortable Nigerians.

Listen, this thing is simple: if you accept that you were paid a job to make Buhari look the part of a democrat or a saviour... by all means grab your cheque and do your job as best as you can.

BUT when you claim God spoke to you, or you speak in tonges about the great wonders this old dictator will bring to a democratic society... you insult us and you insult the God you serve.

If it is business, then let it be business. But don't you dare tell us about God and his wishes when it comes to who leads a nation.

To blend your brilliance and wit with spiritual fraud is foul and demonic. 

You don't know God's wishes. You are not His spokesman.

Pause with the schizophrenia. 

Take your meds.
