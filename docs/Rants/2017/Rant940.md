Let me break it down for you...

Your "rich" uncle has three children. Yes? 

He has to pay over N2million school fees every quarter (13 weeks).

He has to feed his family; daily meals for a family of five, plus a maid could cost over N20,000. Running the home (bric-a-brac) swallows up to N15,000 weekly. When his wife visits Shoprite every Friday to re-stock the house, he spends approximately N70,000.

He pays his gateman N30,000 every month. Pays his driver N40,000 every month. The maid gets N28,000 monthly.

He pays rent at N2.3million every year.

His business space costs N1.9million every year.

He has 8 employees working for him. The manager gets N150,000 per month, the executives get N70,000. The cleaner gets N25,000. And there's a gateman, again, who gets N30,000. Whether he makes money or not, these fellas have to be paid.

There are office running costs that take up to N30,000 weekly.

NEPA post-paid bills nko? Home and office cost can add up to N170,000 monthly! 

Whew!

To keep his sanity, he indulges in expensive alcohol. He takes his weekend excesses with friends seriously. It's the only time he gets to kick back and do something for himself. So yes, he spends close to N30,000 on goat meat peppersoup and choice alcohol every Friday night.

He has a mother. He gives her, say, N100,000 on good months, and N60,000 on not-so-good months.

He maintains four cars. Servicing can cost up to N23,000 on each vehicle every eight weeks. Fuelling gulps N25,000 weekly.

Your "rich" uncle has responsibilities...

It is why he cannot give you that N10,000 you have been bugging him about. 

His rejection of your request is valid.

Kill that sense of entitlement stabbing at your heart. He owes you nothing. He is not thinking of you. He has bills!!! 

Ever heard of that word?

Deal with your own needs.

Grow up.
