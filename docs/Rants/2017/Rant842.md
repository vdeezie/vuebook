"Raising godly children."

Why do schools have that as their major pursuit for the Nigerian child? 

Uniforms encrusted. Walls labelled: Godly Children Can Be Made Here.

Who is a godly child? 

A devout, reverent child committed to God's word?

Is that what we primarily desire when we send our children to school?

Earnestly religious children? 

How does that confront the need to gain knowledge and skill to perform at a higher level in life?

How does "raising godly children" tackle poverty? How does raising religious children provide economic value and benefits to society? How does spirituality better equip the future for significant economic production?

We want a country that will eventually develop into first world status, right? Right! So what role does religion, as we see it, play in this aspiration? How prepared is the future? If we are more interested in "raising godly children" how will this primary ambition facilitate better healthcare, for instance?

Does godliness make for responsible environmental choices? Will it minimize unemployment?

What do we really mean when we claim to "raise godly children" in secular schools?

Do we believe only "godly children" will build the tracks for effective railroad transport system? Do we mean "godly children" will provide effective workforces, good infrastructure for electricity, telecommunications, transportation? Is it the religious child that will create political stability?

How about guaranteeing democracy, stability of institutions? The rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities?

Is it not laziness and lack of imagination on the part of our learning institutions to have our children crested with the responsibility of being "godly"?

What really do we want the Nigerian child to be?

Innovative? Competitive? Strong work ethics? Resourceful?

Be specific with your intentions for the Nigerian child. 

Your desire to "raise godly children" might seem noble, but it is ambiguous and lethargic.
