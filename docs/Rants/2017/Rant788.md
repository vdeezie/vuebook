I went to mega chicken to get chicken. Fried oily drumsticks as reward for the two-hour drive after work.

The server, a pretty girl. Whilst taking my order, she couldn't take her eyes off two guys at the other end. Her admiration was unabashed. She picked my chicken with a fork without even looking at what she was doing. 

It was easy to tell the tribe of the men- red shoes, unbuttoned shirt with white "singlet" on display, beard shaved and curved around the cheek like a canoe, a fat chain on ones neck, a shiny watch on the other's wrist. Go figure. 

I could tell they just got back from, say, Germany. Plenty cologne. Plenty everything. Thank God they didn't sag.

She was transfixed. And unashamed. She stuffed my chicken in a pack, smiled and went straight to the cause of her astonishment. 

If eyes could speak, hers would have said: "Aunty, sorry but I need to get one of those guys to SEE me."

She pushed the sever attending to them gently, and took her place. 

"Please let me," she said without even looking at her colleague. She smiled at the men and asked what they would like.

Thankfully she didn't have one of those irritating accents going on. She kept her smile, flirted without qualms. 

"Look at me. Take off my server's uniform and see that I am the girl you should be with tonight and longer," her eyes were saying.

I was entertained. Shocked at her gaudy taste in men, but impressed all the same.

She went for those guys without the slightest diffidence.

I hope this drive and confidence comes through in her job, and not only for getting a man's attention. If she puts that much effort in the job, she could be an assistant manager in no time.

It was by far the most undisguised approach towards the opposite sex that I have witnessed in a long time.

The last time was most likely in a movie.

She transformed to a coquette in seconds!

I'm not sure the guys noticed her effort. I don't think they are half as suave as she believed them to be. I doubt they can hold conversation beyond a few topics... but hey, it's not like she's Ivanka Trump either.

I left with my chicken and didn't see the conclusion to this romantic comedy.
