Annie Idibia's brother's baby mama says...

"I was working before... I was doing very well...then they brought me here... no work... Annie Idibia doesn't want to help me..."

You left your work. You were doing very well. Yet you left your work. Because... "love"/the promise of marriage/sex.

You left a life just so you can have two children for a man who beats you, smokes marijuana, and can't fully take care of his responsibilities. 

People are mad sha.

I don't care much for how she was treated. Because even that might just be an exaggeration. She reeks of entitlement.

1) She wants him to pay bride price. 

2) Annie isn't taking care of her.

Is that why she couldn't tie her hair in a bun before her interview to display, yet again, a tired theme of black woman sufferhead?

Show me ONE man who leaves behind his life and livelihood because of a woman or the promise of marriage... 

Only then will I take these clowns seriously.
