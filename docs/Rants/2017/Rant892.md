One of the mind-altering experiences for me happened here on Facebook.

I cannot remember who it was, but someone helped a prostitute here, a long time ago. I think a chick met a dude on Facebook. Inbox things happened. And this married idiot agreed to pay a prostitute N500k for sex!!! Smh.

So they met. They had sex. He then decided to be smart. He threw her out of his car, after a good beating, I think. 

I can't recall the details of the nonsense, but I was truly impressed when someone here stood up for the girl and demanded that the man pay what he agreed. A woman for that matter.

I think he eventually paid half the sum. 

But later the entire episode took a Nigerian twist, and this woman who spoke up for the battered prostitute and ensured the agreement was followed through, logged back online and started apologising to men!

What da fuck?!!!

I kept screaming at my laptop as I read her post, "No. No. No. Don't apologise. Don't. Don't. Don't. No."

It was heartbreaking for me.

I mean... you stood for something. This man with scum for brains promised to pay N500k for sex. He reneged on his promise, beat the girl and kicked her out of his moving car.

You made a stand, to ensure that he fulfilled his agreement. Why will you then come back after a successful campaign just to beg men who gathered in your inbox telling you stuff that elevates patriarchy? 

I can only imagine what she had to face supporting a prostitute... but it was something she believed had to be done. An agreement had to be kept. Then stand to the very end. If you were going to change your mind at any point then let it be out of new facts or some form of illumination you attained.

It totally broke my heart to see her show such weakness after running that marathon. 

I wouldn't defend any sexual matter between two adults. That's not my thing. But for the things I stand for, I will never try to balance the sentiments from both angles. It questions your integrity. 

I can't speak so passionately against religion, for instance, and then think of creating a post that vindicates pastors. 

No. Nigerians always do that, but I find it cringe worthy. 

Stand, for Chrissake. Just stand. And don't even try to defend yourself. 

Just stand. For what you believe in. Stand. 

We don't know how to be that way. We always have to look sideways to see if our friends are standing too. How many are standing? Is anyone squatting? Why is so-and-so not standing?

We have all these questions and insecurities we need to  balance  before we eventually take a stand on anything. If the voices are not loud enough, we don't scream. We want to be sure many people (dis)agree with something before we form an opinion; and that opinion must favour the majority. 

Stand. Or go home.

This balancing effect is messy.

PS: It is not about the individual. I still think she is an incredible person (whoever it is). I'm only creating a picture. Do not be tempted to go on a tagging spree.
