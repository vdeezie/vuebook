You'd think, by now, it would be clear to celebrities not to sleep with anyone who has nothing to lose.

You take your $70 million ass to a $20 random individual - sometimes a whore, other times a troll - and you place your worth, all the sweat that has gone into building your dreams, at the bedside of someone looking to be fed lunch, or seeking employment at your front desk, or just awestruck to be fucking you.

Not a good idea. 

If you have to cheat, at least find someone who has something to lose. So both of you can be nasty all by yourselves - hanging tits and balls on a chandelier without a single plot to revenge spilling on your way out as you walk out the door, to meet again.

That you find certain individuals attractive is mind boggling. Pearls and pigs don't match. 

Look at Kevin Hart - for every Africa American comedian still living in his mother's basement without enough career opportunities beyond local bars that give shopping vouchers and free beer as reward for a stand-up comedy feat every Friday night, Kevin owes the culture a little discretion. Like Obama, carrying the entire black race on his shoulder when he was president. You could feel the weight on him, because he knew any slip would be a judgment against all blacks - from Brooklyn to Somalia. And we are grateful for that, aren't we? 

But here we are with this short man, making a mess of a second marriage. Messing around with women who need to negotiate sex videos with TMZ.

Even me with my empty bank account, I can't be messing with no social media attention whoring male.

Find someone with a business valued at Â£10 million. Have sex and tell him to cover your nipples with ice cream, then go to the bathroom and do it in the jacuzzi, swing your genitals from the living room chandelier.. do the most outrageous things you have fantasized about... just be sure you are doing life and sex with someone who has a lot to lose.

Please note that "loving Christ" "humility" "God-Is-My-Witness" type people do not rate very highly on the value scale. The real value of sexual discretion is tied to character and wealth. 

It may lower your chances of getting laid, but at least you know that when you finally fuck, you won't be fucking scum.
