I have always wondered about these things, and I think I am beginning to have clarity on the matter.

But first let me tell you how my typical day goes:

By 5.30am I wake the kids to get ready for school, then I jump back in bed for another hour of snooze. 

I take a peek in my phone, there are approximately 10 Facebook inbox messages to be read. And 38 notifications. 

I see the Gmail icon like a stack of envelopes suggesting the number of emails waiting to be read, anticipating response and reaction.

I go to bed anyways.

6.30am, fully awake. There are now over 22 inbox messages. And over 18 emails with the urgency of a cat pursuing a rat.

At every given time, there are 69 notifications on Facebook by 7am.

8am and off to work. I make several calls that I know must be made, else the day will swallow me and there won't be a minute to spare for these casual check-ins. These calls are important to me. Let's leave it at that.

I don't do BBM, WhatsApp groups or Facebook groups. Or any forum/group for that matter. Still, I have a full plate.

At the office, there are at least 3 people waiting to see me by 12pm. 5 in-house meetings I have to be part of to address different projects. 2 out-of-office meetings.

I am reminded by my assistant to send "thank you" notes for gifts that I get regularly.

There are approximately 10 incoming calls before 1pm. There are many text messages I have to send and countless emails that keep going back and forth.

There are 3 brainstorming sessions daily all relying on my 60% contribution. 

There are regular radio programmes to monitor. Articles I need to write and/or approve.

I have 4 stalkers saved as "fools" on my phone who barge in on my busy schedule with endless calls and "prayers" or admonition via texts (actually 11, but 7 have given up on this woman who just doesn't budge).

People want to hang out. People check in. Social calls. Admirers. Friends. Acquaintances. Dates that have been rain-checked so many times they seem like they will finally happen in one of our mansions in heaven when we die.

And this is just me. A regular person without one factory producing salt that 50% of Nigerians patronise. I don't run a bank that caters to 10% of the society's financial need. I don't run a state. And I don't have an oil well.

I have to stubbornly make out time or play truant at work (which is not something I enjoy) just to make time for everything that demands my attention.

I have had a date with someone who told me before the hour that he may receive "a few calls if you don't mind." 

I don't mind. I never mind if it is business. Because I will not switch off my own phone just so I can look into anybody's eyes. 

The "few calls" turned out to be many urgent business calls he had to receive. It seemed everyone in Lagos needed him to sign a document, endorse a business, approve a project, confirm a cheque... and truth be told, he barred some calls, yet there were still many calls coming in, relying on his approval for projects to take effect. 

The food was nice. The ambience was great. We made few sentences in between the calls. I TOTALLY understood his life, but he felt guilty and promised to switch his phone off the next time. 

No. No. No. Don't switch off your phone for a date. That would be too contrived for it to mean anything special. I am not 21. I know what priorities should look like.

That date took him over 6 months before I came around to it. I wasn't going to get any less busy, and neither would he. But do we pause the rest of our lives just to have dinner with someone we are attracted to and stay guilty that we have busy lives that we actually enjoy?

No.

So this is my point:

When bloggers say Dangote, for instance, is dating a few beauty queens... or Adenuga went in a "tinted" SUV to pick up girls from Unilag... or Ambode is personally pursuing a retarded Pretty Mike because of dog chain...

I wonder how these things are even possible when "mere mortals" like us wake up into a full day with all our activities begging for our attention/solution and not one minute to spare for a quick fuck (if at all it is what we desire)...

Do we not exaggerate how much time successful entrepreneurs and busy public officers have for constant frivolities?

I remember when I ran a community publication in Festac, whenever I had to fix an appointment with the local government chairman for talks on how the magazine can collaborate with his office, there were always a hundred people waiting to see him too. Always. So overwhelming, he would take the "back door" when he got weary.

So where do these busy/successful people find the time to sneak a "university student" inside the trunk of a car for sex when ordinary me still cannot find the time to attend all my meetings.

*PS: Celebrities and House of Assembly crazies don't count as regards this issue.
