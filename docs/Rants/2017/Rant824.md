The only reason Stephanie Otobo could be a victim is for the alleged threats to her life by the all powerful clergyman.

She is NOT a victim because sex happened.

She is NOT a victim because sex happened.

She is NOT A victim because sex happened.

She is yet another favourite personality on my world journal. I like women who stand up to authority.

But she shouldn't be described as a victim of psychological abuse.

A woman has a right to sex. And a woman has a right to regret the sex she had with certain men.

Your regret and/or hindsight does not make you a victim. 

The experience can make you angry, bitter, better, wiser... but a victim you are not.

And that should be a good thing, right? 

There's no lasting honour in wearing an insignia that suggests you are a recovering sufferer.

She is a victim only because randy horny apostle thinks his rod can satisfy as well as destroy the lives of the women he fucks.

PS: I just wish people can carry on with debauchery without getting God involved. I love God. Dishonour your name - the name your father gave you, but leave God out of your depravities. Ugh!
