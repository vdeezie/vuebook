# Rant796


January 26, 2017

Access bank and 7up are hosting the #RunLagos marathon...

And the winning prize is N50k.

Abi what did I jus' hear on radio?

Seriously? 

Unless I'm going deaf, that is some shitty money for a competition.

Habamana! 

Is that sum supposed to encourage Nigerians to actually run?

How can two big brands collaborate to give a winner N50k???

You cannot go shopping like a king with that amount anywhere in Nigeria. You may not be able to even shop like a pauper with that sum.

N50k?

We went to Max the other day. Two palazzo pants and three tops... and he spent N48,000.

He lifted the polythene bag like a sacrifice to the gods. "The naira is finished," he said.

I mean... Max is supposed to be basic, unpretentious shopping, yet N50k was clearly a joke in there (PS: Love my palazzos though. Bless).

I think high-priced branded gifts would have served the purpose for this marathon oh. 

You spend so much money for advertisement- above the line and below the line. The ads are running every minute on over 10 stations across the city. Plenty pay for advertising agencies and promotional outifits... yet the winner gets way less than 1% of all that money exchanging hands.

Hian. 

They surely are banking on Nigeria's alarming poverty rate that is steadily on the rise... where even N10k will make people do the unimaginable. 

God dey.
