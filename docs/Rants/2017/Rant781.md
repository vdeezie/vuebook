This Pretty Mike arrest is unimpressive. Lagos State and feminists getting an adult arrested for having a leash on another consenting adult is rather silly.

Yes, they are consenting adults. I refuse to have retarded discussions on “how do you know?’”

If you are so concerned about what we do to "minors" and the tethers we place on them, then look the way of the Emir in Katsina holding down Habiba Isa, a 14 year old child. Let your interest remain there. Let that case (or cases of such importance) be the judge of your competence as a tag-carrying whatever.

Did you not hear of the 7 year old girl forced to sleep with her father whilst her mother heals from a health predicament? Do you need to be angry about something that is truly demeaning that requires The Police to attend to? Holler at Evans Ufeli. He is a lawyer with all the grim stories that will make your blood rush to your head. Pretty Mike's shenanigans is "non-issue".

We may hoot and screech online and write articles that address this charade about dog chains… because it is a charade, something this silly fellow probably picked up from dingy streets in Holland. 
However, it doesn’t make it a crime. 

BDSM collar is not a crime. This is sexual expression. The ladies are not children. One of them even claims to be a lawyer and, wait for it, a feminist (one of the reasons why we need to drop silly titles moving on). It may well be a transaction of sort, why shouldn’t it be? Why should financial benefits make it criminal? They have the power to say “No”. Women always have the power to say No. It is another matter entirely if they are (un)aware of their rights. And if they like the role play, why should that be criminal?

It is unpleasant to see and it surely deserves our moral judgments, but to arrest the idiot is too much of a tragicomedy dragged on longer than is necessary.

We must understand that we are all designed differently. Some people find bondage and masochism kinky. 

I am very sensitive to scorn and humiliation as it relates to sexual/love relationships, but what right do I have to use that as a yardstick for another woman?

I am a Nigerian, there’s urgency to my life. There are important things I need the Lagos State government to pay attention to, there are desperate situations The Police should attend to, there are heartbreaking matters Feminists need to pour their energy on.
Pretty Mike and his obsession with BDSM chains should not be on any list.

We are a joke in this country.

The sheer mockery of our collective lives is a tragedy.

The next question will be, “will you let your sister do such a thing? Have a chain around her neck?”

That is the Nigerian question. The question that is supposed to pierce your conscience and make you repent of what you do not wish for your loved one.

Yawn!

Are we not asking the same questions about homosexuals? “You that is supporting gays, will you like for your son to be a *sic* homosexual?”

Sterile argument. Unworthy of any response.

We all have our lives to live. As long as there is consent, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone. Give your angry moral opinions… but to involve The Police in a case like this is silly.

When you are yet to understand why children are raped in IDP camps; 7 year olds are cleaning your car windows in traffic, sometimes as late as 9pm; powerless teenagers are married off to powerful men… pursuing Pretty Mike is the greatest satire of our entire breathing time on earth.

It would be laughable if it wasn’t so dim.
