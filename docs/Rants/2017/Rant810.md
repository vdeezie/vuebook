The gracious thing to do when you receive an award is to dedicate it to someone in your industry.

Someone you admire, respect, even aspire to.

OR dedicate it to a cause.

We don't practice or understand that gesture in Nigeria. 

Mount a podium, grab your award, and dedicate it to a God you do not deeply respect or truly believe in. That's us.

When Jennifer Lawrence, for instance, receives an award, she'd say... "I deeply admire everyone in this category. I am so clumsy. I don't know how this happened."

Self-deprecation is charming and delightful; even when it is pretentious... as long as insecurities aren't running over. And it always works if you have some form of civil intelligence.

But in Nigeria... Mba! We will clutch the award by the balls, call our kinsmen to join us on stage. Sing a chorus. Instruct God on what next he needs to bless in our lives...

Then we go on to dedicate the award to haters.

"They said I wouldn't make it. They mocked me. They called me names. See me now. Here I am. God has prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies...yada yigi yugu yaga."

We stay longer than is necessary... then we walk back to our seats like chief butlers of the universe. 

In other words, Adele's speech at the Grammys is nothing out of the ordinary. 

PS: If I win an award, I will dedicate it to Temidayo. 

Yes ke!

"I don't deserve this award," I'd say. "Temidayo's work is monumental; she is an original. There's not one piece written from underneath a table. There's no grovelling for crumbs. There's no fear. No frivolities. Just pure genius."

I'd break the plaque in half. Then skip my hopefully less round(er) frame than Adele's into the sunlight.
