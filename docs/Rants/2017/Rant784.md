I have, at this hour, 60+ people signed up for The Nigerian Revolution.

I am sorry I have not responded to every single message. I am really bad with chats. But I thank you all.

I am not sure the capacity of many signees, but I appreciate your reaching out. If the only task you do is to stand under the sun when we need people to stand, then STAND.

That is enough. 

I believe we will be 100+ strong before the end of this week. Some are Diasporas and cannot be readily available for on-the-ground tasks; however they are ready to gather the numbers wherever they are to roar when we roar.

That is good enough.

Many people ask: “Joy, what can I do. Tell me. I will do it”

OK.

It is not just one event, it is what we will become until the government and the politicians begin to feel some sense of responsibility for what they have made of us and our country; and be brought to some form of accountability when they humiliate us and deny us our rights.

They must listen to us. 

Many are crying in my inbox, and here I was thinking I was alone. It is comforting to meet you all. Your dedication to the task is encouraging. Finally, I recognize that I am not mad. That voice and dissatisfaction speak to many of us.

This is where we make patterns like architects on how we can control our own nation. 

But first, I need to build a committee. The people who will gather in a room and draw up the agenda for the year.

Also, I need financiers. You can only do very little without money. We need to get a venue, sit there for 5 hours to work, think, and plan… cry if we have to. Let that anger out! Scream. Then sit down, take a marker and write on that whiteboard: how we plan to build a new nation.

It doesn’t get easier from here on. It is going to be tough. You will go broke. You will be told to “cool down nah! Na only you get Nigeria?!”. You will be called names. They will sub you. They will gather to talk shit. Yes, fellow poor Nigerians with their feathers viciously plucked will gather to talk shit about YOU trying to get back the country for THEIR children. They will say you are trying to sabotage the present administration. They will play the politics card. They will call you "over sabi" "your wahala too much" "let sleeping dogs lie". Your pastor will tell you to “leave it for God. Just pay your tithe”. Your family will say you embarrass them with all this rebellion.

But I promise you, it will be worth it. You will finally meet with contentment.

In all of the mockery and opposition, there you will find what you have been searching for (for) so long as a Nigerian.

Satisfaction beyond understanding.

I promise you.

PS: Let me go and look for money for the venue we shall hold our first meeting. 

I’ll be back.
