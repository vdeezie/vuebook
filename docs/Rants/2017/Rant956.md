Tiziana Cantone, from Italy, allowed for a video to be recorded of her giving a blow job.

She looked up and said, "Are you filming me? Good!" And continued blowing that pipe. 

She did it to spite an Ex-boyfriend.

She sent the video to the Ex. And the Ex shared it online.

The world gathered round to watch this video an adult female, without coercion, approved to be recorded.

Then the backlash came, as should be expected. 

She tried everything to erase this "mistake". Changed jobs, moved cities... nothing worked.

Eventually she committed suicide. She was 31.

OK. She's dead.

But this is where I am heading to... people blame Sexism, Misogyny, even Patriarchy for her death. Claiming Italian men slut shamed her to a point where her life meant nothing. 

And that is where I say you are wrong.

What do you expect when you send a sex tape to an enemy?

It is not Sexism. It is nothing. There's no moral to this story. She was either going to rise above it or die under the weight of it.

She wanted to make an Ex jealous by sending a video blowing a penis. Ex shared the video on the Internet (as he has a right to, after all the video was sent to him.  He didn't hack a phone to get it). The world went gaga (like we are wired to respond to sex). Girl dies.

Period.

Tell me where in all of this Misogyny played a role. 

Nowhere.
