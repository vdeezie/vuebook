There’s something suspicious about a man who argues vehemently for women – not from a cerebral point of view backed by research and study, but from an emotional approach, barking and scratching for Women’s Right. Their text and spat are usually reserved for domestic situations… effortlessly trading their gender in to replace that which they clearly observe is “beneath” a woman.

If you are trying to “emancipate” a woman from certain situations, why do you then swap roles with the other gender – your gender, to do the same chores women of a new age despise?

It always leaves me bemused. Like my gender is being patronized. It seems totally insincere. Especially as it’s all cyber venom with little evidence of authenticity. He just might have slapped the daylight out of a wife or girlfriend before logging on to social media to holler at his cyber girls – as a fellow member of clique “liberate the girl child”. These men stay on comment sections too long trying to tell us how much they love the liberated woman.

I just can’t.

Girls do that shit too - trying too hard to fit into a group of guys drinking beer and slut shaming exes. You find the girls laughing at sexist jokes, for whatever reason – mainly insecurity, or a need to be accepted as different, special, “correct girl” etc.

For all the instant sketchy sexual offers and sometimes physical assault women cry about on social media, it is mainly perpetuated by these men who cry louder than women on a thread addressing women’s issues.

A child is raped, and these type of men are there to shame the entire male gender, including themselves; waiting for women to gather round and show their unreserved love for his support. He reads the comments of those who won’t mind having him as a boyfriend, “for being so understanding of the female plight”.

Nigga, please.

This does not, in any way, discredit genuine quest for gender equality by some men… but you can tell the difference when a man is engaged in a subject from a point that removes his testicles from the discussion. The minute he gets too emotional with little or no depth - jumping in and out of comments, assuring women that everything will be ok… I want to dip his head into hot palm oil. Burn, bitch. You liar! Check his history, there are, at least, three girls who’d have had drinks with him, and he couldn’t keep the monster in check – the person he really is. He’d grab for breasts and ass; clawing his way into a vagina unsuccessfully… then he’d block all block-ables the minute she goes almost unscathed straight to her wall to cry to the world.

Jaguda statistics show that these dudes who love to see women live without any care in the world, fulfilling bra-and-pant rights, are dudes who stand right behind to grab the ass and pinch a nipple.

See your MCMs all over social media and the stories women are telling about them.

I mean, these men are fucking transparent. Can’t you see?!

The ones that call on God, dey one side.

The ones fighting tooth and nail to prove that a woman is a more superior human being, dey one corner.

The ones stating that a woman can wear whatever she likes, dey the other corner with a police record of sexually molesting a 15 year old in his neighbourhood because she was always tying a wrapper on her chest.

None of their family members can attest to this gender equality fervor. His wife still pounds yam by 11pm every other night. He has never cooked a meal in his house or has any clue where the broom is kept.  He doesn’t think his wife should work. No negotiations, who will look after the children? His sister is not his equal.

But he is on Facebook fighting for your rights.

I don’t have a problem with patriarchy and its men, not anymore. As long as you are not a sexual predator, a manipulative piece of shit, a bastard paedophile, as long as you have integrity and you take care of your responsibilities, we are good!  

“Male feminists” who are endlessly vile and manipulative are no better than the scum we accuse patriarchy of.

“Can you borrow me money, after all we are equal.”

“Sex is not a big deal. Loosen up *sic*. We are equal.”

And all other juvenile retarded nonsense. Is that where your feminism ends?

LOL! Nothing works in Nigeria, you must understand that. Everything is twisted to fit our very insecure, very disturbing state of mind.

These niggas are transparent.
