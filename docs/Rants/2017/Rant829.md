# Rant829


March 15, 2017

The best heartbreak I ever had was in 2014.

I took full advantage of my state of emotion.

I wasn't eating so I lost weight. My cheeks disappeared. My face was thin and radiant. 

My waist was the thinnest it had ever been. 

By God, I was beautiful. Even I knew it.

I flaunted it. I flirted. Skinny makes you ten times more confident. I would look straight into the eyes of a man I liked, which was something I couldn't possibly do before.

I discovered curls (see pix). I ditched weaves for a bit and rocked my curls. It took years off me.

I don't sulk on heartbreak, I get really angry. Anger moves me to act for my good.

I took a week off work so I could sleep all day. Boy, did I sleep!!!! 

I discovered Clarins. I read tons of books. I shopped for dresses.

I wasn't a victim.

I was angry. I was beautiful. And I was evolving. 

I started #TheConversation. Had my rants staged by Crown Troupe of Africa. Segun Adefila tapped right into my anger and made gold. We made money too. 

NASCO approached me after too many angry rants, and I started #NascoMoments.

I was made better because of a broken heart. I would rise every morning believing I survived bullshit, it was up to me to make diamonds of the situation.

I got out more. Had my first buffet alone at Oriental Hotel. I made it a habit to spend weekends alone at Colonnades hotel. 

Heartbreak made me realise life is too short. I'm not giving one minute to mourn anyone.

Mourn your own "death".

I have life. And I don't know how long I have here. But I have it now, so what should I do with it?

I jumped on a plane and met with a stranger in Manhattan in 2016. Best vacation ever! 

I started an online radio regardless of the "Nigerian issue". 

All because of a heartbreak in 2014, my life is one moving train. There's no stopping me.

Heartbreak made me embrace my strength. 

I lived the consequences of a broken heart. And I lived it well.

Yes I did shed a few tears. They were exhilarating moments that I cherished. It worked for me like yoga.

I cherished what I could do with a broken heart.

The heart eventually healed, and I am still here.

I will always be here to try at love again. Or life. Or business. Or reading another book. Or whatever. 

Sometimes that's all you need to do to stay healthy, keep your heart beating.

There's nothing quite disastrous as living in the misery of a broken heart.

Live in the miracle of your situation.
