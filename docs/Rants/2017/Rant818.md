This society will kill you if you let it.

Learn not to take Nigerians seriously. 

I was married once, you know...

And I was very specific about my possessions.

It is my wrist watch. I bought it with my money. 

It is my brand new car. I earned money enough as an editor to buy that sweet gold Honda City. Loved every curve on that cute baby.

My money, bitch. 

It is my signature on the children's receipts, because I pay school fees.

It is my salary.

Even when I was told to submit the salary as a good wife... I said, "Nah."

When joint account didn't work... when doing business together didn't work...

I got up one morning, stopped the so-called joint business and started a career.

Yet everyone, except my family, told me it was wrong to claim ownership to things I bought.

Cover him with love, they said. Cover his insecurities by flaunting your success as a gift from him.

Yup. They said so. 

Of course, I didn't listen to anything they said.

I can't give credit to any man for the things I do myself. I am too much of a narcissist to share my little proud moments.

NOW... here is Tonto Dikeh doing exactly what society wants...

Society tells the woman to "help the man look good. Praise him constantly for all the little things you can afford to do for yourself."

Society pushes the woman to buy an SUV and put a man's name on the receipt. 

Always a broke ass man ready to take the glory of a woman's hard work. Always.

Because, well, it isn't so cool when you have a man and you still have to provide for yourself. It is always sweeter to know that your ass is so tight, it can get men to do things for you. 

That's the real glory for the woman in Patriarchy. 

The true success is to have a man buy you things. If you buy your own property and build your own empire, it isn't amazing enough. 

Linda isn't cool enough because...well...she's doing it all by herself. 

To really be worthy of applause, you have to be the one serenaded by a man.

You have to gush and cry and announce that a husband finally handed you the keys to a Landcruiser. 

Your achievements are authentic only when you can live vicariously through a husband.

So pray tell, why are you all bashing Tonto?

Is this not the Nigerian wife you endorsed? 

The one with zero bragging rights, submitting her every goal at the feet of a man; lieing like a fool about things he didn't buy and can't afford.

She did it for you, so you can leave her alone.

Phew!

A woman is nothing until she is loved by a man. That is what you were taught. 

Men are the prize. 

And I have come to accept this will never change.

Nothing can change Nigerian women. Feminism here is on cheap crack; the practitioners are worse than the demons attacking the average Nigerian. Things will never change.

But just know that... you do not have to be like the rest of them.

If you insist that, "I am not one of you..."

You will never be one of them.
