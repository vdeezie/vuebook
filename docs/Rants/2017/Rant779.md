LASTMA happened to me today. 

A female LASTMA official. 

Driving through Ahmadu Bello way, I had just one second to decide if I should take a detour to a right or keep to my left. In that split second, my tyre sat on a solid white line dividing the road. 

Just one lonely tyre on a solid white line...

That was all it took for three LASTMA officials to surround me oh. The lady was using a techno phone to take pictures of my plate number (or pretending to be doing so). 

The two men looked at me and I think they lost the initial motivation they gathered as they marched towards me. When they came closer and realised it was a woman, they raised their brows, frowned a little, then a small smile, and walked away. Maybe the "offence" wasn't as monstrous as they'd wished. So they left me in the hands of their female colleague.

She was yanking the passenger front door of my car. I slid the window down to ask if she ate a demon this afternoon, she threw a hand in, opened my door and sat comfortably.

I was amused.

"Madam, you crossed the line on the road," she said.

"Well, you are crossing a line now sitting in my car. Why the fuck are you sitting in my car?!"

"Ah! Did you not see the line?"

"Which bloody line?" I was furious. 

"Oya let's go to the office so I can show you the road user chart and you will understand your offence."

I felt like punching her hard on the nose. But I only hissed, took the detour and announced to her that I was heading home, and she could be my guest at dinner with my kids.

"Madam, where are you taking me to?" she asked.

"To my home! Didn't you hear me?"

"See, this is a simple matter, your tyre touched the white line."

"Bitch, I did nothing wrong. I'm taking you home." 

Na so I start to drive oh. After a few minutes, she looked my way and realised I wasn't sane. I wasn't sane at all. 

She sighed. Murmured something. Bad market, perhaps? 

"Madam, drop me. Go and meet your children."

"No you must follow me." Power shifted hands too quickly. I kept driving. 

"Madam, just drop me. You can go. Don't worry. But next time..."

"I did nothing wrong! I did nothing wrong!! I did nothing wrong!!!" Now I was getting really upset.

"OK. OK. Let me come down!"

I stopped the car suddenly.

"Go!"

She alighted. 

It would take her 10 minutes to walk back to where it all started.

PS: I don reach house.
