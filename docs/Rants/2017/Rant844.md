Forgive me in advance as I spew my terribly flawed ethnic opinions on relationships.

"My mother will not accept you because she wants me to marry from my village..." - said no Yoruba man ever! 

There are no "my mother said" conversations when you date Yoruba men of a certain status- from aspirational, middle to upper class.

There are no "villages" to consider either.

Yoruba men spread their wings from Nnewi to Benin to Katsina. They marry for more reasons than the river dividing one region from the other.

Yorubas are accused of being tribalistic... but it is not Yorubas distinguishing between dialects and villages. 

Theirs is not the tribe with a penchant for discriminating amongst/against itself. Recognising every little detail to create a wall between people who should find more in common. In other tribes, a tiny pond is enough to ensure you do not cross over to marry, say, Chinedu. 

It's exhausting trying to follow up with the endless need to classify people into little boxes of acceptance in some tribes.

That is NOT a Yoruba thing. 

Yoruba men do not judge. I have never had to date someone who'd tell me... "It is because you have children we cannot be serious."

Maybe I happen to date lucky. 

I have never been made to feel inadequate in anyway. My age is never a subject of concern.

Ever.

Rarely do they try to change you.

If a Yoruba man finds you a teetotaler, he will most likely leave you a teetotaler. Maybe a romantic attempt to get you to taste good wine, that's about it. It is not his job to turn you into a social drinker for his own good. And he will never cringe when you order your Malt at a fancy bar... even when the waiter looks from you to him before saying, "No Malt from 10pm. This is 10.15pm."

Lol!

A Yoruba man is not out to adjust your confidence. He is not obsessed with a "good girl status". He isn't trying to dim your light. He is in no competition with you.

It is why people think they are "unambitious"; "they are not go-getters," they say.

Yawn!

Wrong. 

Unlike many other tribes, Yoruba men are quite comfortable with the idea of equality. Less threatened by your ambitions and drive.

And if society will leave them alone, a Yoruba man will support his high-flying partner without checking every minute to see if his penis has dissappeared.

Many of them will date a woman very different from what is "acceptable". And they will love her like kilode! 

And lastly, Yoruba men are probably the few that understand that marriage is not the goal, nor be by force. Happiness first and always. 

It is probably the only tribe that allows walking away from unhappiness easy. Just carry your bag and go. No "abomination" committed. No sacrilege. No plenty meeting. This village is not going to meet that village to decide what is good for you. You decide what you want.

The matriarch in yoruba land is real. Nobody tells a yoruba woman she cannot build her own house in her village at Ikorodu.

In yoruba hierarchy, age is more to be reverred than gender. So women own power too.

If anything less is practiced presently, it is religion messing  with a beautiful culture. 

But I deviate... I was talking about yoruba men and how empowering they make of women they love.

But like I said, maybe I date lucky 

(...because I have encountered some disgraceful yoruba goats from cyber distance. Keep that distance)
