There was that one time a friend's car was stolen in a parking lot.

We were very confused. We knew where we had parked, but when you lose something, you can't be so sure anymore, so we checked around the car park... perhaps a legion of ants pushed the car away from its original spot.

So confused the poor guy was, he lifted an empty disposable cup from the floor to check, just maybe, his Toyota Camry was hiding inside of it.

Nobody laughed. It seemed like the most natural thing to do.

I actually thought, probably, if he hit the bottom of the cup, the car would drop. No such luck.

We never found that car.

Now I wonder, perhaps, if we had checked under the pure water sachet lying right there on the floor... maybe... just maybe...
