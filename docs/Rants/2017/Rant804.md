# Rant804


February 6, 2017

Nollywood penetrated Goodluck Jonathan's administration. They had access to the president. They premiered their movies at Aso Rock, took pictures with the president, reminded him of funds allocated to the industry. Musicians took selfies with Jonathan. The Minister of Youth was young.

Young people want power. They want responsibility. They want a chance to run the country that has promised them since birth that they were the "leaders of tomorrow".

Young people in Nigeria want this so badly... yet what did they do?

They voted in a 73 year old ex-military man who had ruled as a despot in the 80s; and now in flowing native attire as insignia to his new found love and acceptance for democracy, tried desperately to hold power and failing three times over, they finally let the wolf in to... wait for this, spite the sheep.

We take the remains of a man from the 80s, crown him our president, and called him: Change, Democratic Leader, Our Hope, Our Future.

Dumb and dumber.

Young Nigerians, you were closer to taking a good chunk of leadership under GEJ than you ever will under Buhari.

For one, Jonathan wasn't desperate for power. He was clueless about a lot of things, used kid gloves for desperate issues, no doubt... But he never stopped you from demonstrating your fundamental right to protest and question his authority.

You called him pig, fool, dog, goat... but you weren't arrested. Now under Buhari, people are afraid to share proof of a picture being peddled as current state of his health. 

They are afraid to question. As he has proven to be vindictive, with traces of despotism sticking out from his ears and sleeves, like a werewolf, trying to still his demons.

I don't care for Jonathan. But you had a chance with him. As they say, you are only three people away from sitting next to President Jonathan. There was always a chance with him.

OK, so he was such a clueless man? Fine!

His "cluelessness" would have worked for you. His calm, respectful, sangfroid disposition would have been the ticket to true change. He would give more positions to young people. Open doors to the industry ruled by the youth... 

Things happen when doors are open and when the person behind it holds a smile. Like Jonathan's.

But now you have a door shut in your face, with a tag on the door:

"I belong to nobody".

What that means is: "I don't know you. And I don't care. Fuck off."

Dear Nigeria Youth, knock your head on a wall until it bleeds.
