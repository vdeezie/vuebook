In the entire force, not ONE retired police officer has set up a Private Investigation firm.

In a country of 170 million people and counting, there's not one acknowledged Private Detective business.

That is what happens in a country where all you do is pray.

We don't think.

With the infamous and ravaging poverty known to the average Nigeria police officer, yet not one of them have sought early retirement to start an investigation firm.

Do you know how much you can make trying to appease the curiosity of a wealthy housewife who desperately needs to find the main side chick taking all of Oga's time? Those elite women sitting in mansions with 10 dildos and a prayer room will pay ANYTHING to see what's in their husband's phones and how to track some of the University girls "disturbing" him.

How about tracking a cousin who disappeared from her home in Ogun state and later reappears on a blog, one month later, with a new husband in Kano? 

Tracking a runaway housemaid nko? A driver who steals your N350k from the car the minute you enter a meeting...

How about trying to track a fraud or just a fool? 

I did a bit of research, called a few police friends and lawyers and they all shook their heads. Only the police gets to handle your issues. Yes, of course we know that. 

But I'm still shocked that not ONE police officer, or even a lawyer (as I hear they have legal slot to start one) has anything like that.

Abroad, all you need is 5 years in the force and you can get get a license to start something. 

And the thing is, you don't need an office space per se. Your spare room, dining room or a small part of your bedroom can serve the purpose. Run a private detective website with urgent numbers to call.

To have people complain about how poorly the police is paid and yet not ONE has started something that can drive them towards wealth is baffling. 

I just don't understand.
