Today on Judge Judy.

Case: Two former friends. One borrows money to settle her mortgage. Then refuses to pay back. Claims it was a gift. 

Amount: $2,000

Judge Judy asks, "Tell me about yourselves."

Lender responds, "My name is Tisha. I work at so-and-so. I have three kids and five grandchildren. I live alone."

And borrower? Tell us about yourself:

"I am Keira. I used to work in the same company with Tisha...and nobody liked her. Not even the Manager."

Lol!

Thank God for Judge Judy, in typical Judy fashion, she shuts her up. 

"I don't care who hates her or likes her. That's your business and I don't even believe you. Just tell me why you refuse to pay back a loan."

LMAO!

"It was a gift," the defendant replied 

"How can a woman with five grand children give up $2,000 dollars to you? Do I look stupid? Make your lie believable because this is pissing me off," Judy spits.

This is why justice is more superior to righteousness. 

It doesn't matter if plaintiff comes to court in Armani suit and the defendant appears in rags... justice is not superficial; it will demand that the defendant still pay up her debt.

Religion, on the other hand, feasts on the physical- how sad you look when accused determines if you are repentant; how miserable you're dressed determines your level of remorse; how many tears you shed shows you are a new being and old things have passed away.

It is why Tiwa and Mercy had to dress up like slaves to address domestic violence. Because there's no justice in Nigeria, just religion. And religion suffers myopia.

Religion wants to know how many people love you, how "kind" you are, how "humble"... before it can decide if you are guilty of, say, paedophilia.

Is it not on Instagram I read one daft comment on the Mercy Aigbe vs. Lanre Gentry matter?

"When I visited one hotel some years back, I saw one man attending to everybody, smiling and serving everybody. A very humble man. Someone later told me that the man was Lanre Gentry, owner of the hotel. Ah so humble. Now Mercy is lying that a humble man like that will beat her? Not true."

What gets my goat is knowing that these kind of people are having sex and raising children. 

We are judged only by religion in this country. Even The Police operates as a religious group.

Judge Judy's verdict: "Defendant to pay the sum of $2,000 dollars to Plaintiff. Case dismissed."

Period.

A round of applause for Justice.

Other methods of reconciliation can like to wear ashes on the head.
