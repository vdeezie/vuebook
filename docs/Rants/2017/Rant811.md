Two things:

Last year, my girls and I were having late breakfast at KFC. The doorman was confronted by a senior colleague who, in the full glare of their customers, lashed out to him.

What was his offence? 

He had the balls, oh the temerity, to text his superior begging to be paid a ripe old salary of two months.

We heard every word from where we ate. Every word designed to intimidate and shame him.

I was going to stand up and challenge the supervisor for such appalling behaviour. 

You cannot owe a man his salary and have the audacity to shame him... in the full glare of publicity.

But Ife shook her head, "Not today, mum. Too early in the day for trouble. Please." So I stopped myself.

When we headed out, I squeezed N1,000 in the palm of the doorman and tried to assure him that he'd be paid. Keep the faith, I said... or something ridiculous like that. 

Yesterday, a young man was profusely at my service at a restaurant, I ignored him. Another attempt by security to get N200 or so for doing absolutely nothing for me, I thought.

"Mummy, that's the guy that you gave money when his boss wouldn't pay his salary!" Jolade said.

Ooooh!!! That's him alright.

"I don't understand adults, how do you owe someone money, yet you put up an attitude about it. Shouldn't you be sorry?" Ife said, recalling the event.

"Oh! But I have heard of bosses who owe salaries, yet travel for vacation with family, then sends packs of indomie noodles to staff owed 7 months salary for Christmas. With prayers to boot," I said.

"That's wicked. Adults are silly!" Jolade said.

"Indeed we are."

We recalled another incident:

One of our neighbours, a little girl (barely 7 at the time), had an unfortunate accident one morning. A bottle fell from the three-storey building and smashed on her head.

I heard the noise so I rushed out to see what it was all about.

I looked from my balcony. Maybe the height exaggerated the issue, but all I saw when I looked down was blood all around her like a pond.

Instead of the relatives to rush her to the hospital, they were busy threatening the person who mistakenly caused the accident. 

"If anything happen to this pikin ehn, you go hear am!"

I rushed down the stairs, told them to shut it and take the child to the hospital. I volunteered to drive her, but her mother snapped out of the need to deal with the culprit and took the child to the hospital.

In the evening, back from work; I went to see the little girl. Never been there before. She was fine now, with a bandage on her head. I squeezed a N500 note in her palm, "for Ribena", I said. Whatever. 

The mum came out the room to say, "thank you." She managed to keep that up for a week (saying her "good mornings"), I managed to pretend it mattered to me... until we both slipped back into coma... back to not saying a word to each other. 

"Isn't that strange?" Normal human beings would be friends by now for that gesture." Ife said.

"Adults are not normal," Jolade shook her head.

"They are not at all. I don't feel like growing up."

Then we talked about abusive marriages and women who love and/or accommodate pain and humiliation...

And we also talked about religion and pastors who build elite schools and own choice properties acquired from congregational tithing... yet discriminates against the educational needs and requirements of the tithers. 

With all of this information discussed yesterday as we drove around the neighbourhood looking for cocopops... the girls have decided not to become foolish adults. 

PS: Today, I will show them the picture and story of Anja Ringgren Lov√©n, the Danish woman who saved a child accused of being a witch in the country of their birth, Nigeria.
