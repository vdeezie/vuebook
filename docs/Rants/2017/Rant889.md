Let me tell you about my day.

Woke up by 5.30 am. Slapped the alarm clock off the table. I could hear the girls getting ready for school. They had cocopops for breakfast, as usual. 

I dragged myself out of bed by 6.03am. I was ready for work by 7.17 am. We head out together. I drop them off, then drive into the sunrise.

Three hours in the office, and I said to myself, “what am I doing here?”

Literally, what am I doing in the office when all I think about is a beach with blue sea and white sand and people minding their business while I read melancholy literature.

My mind drifted to Manhattan. 

Then I remembered my Igbo boyfriend from tertiary institution who used to buy me designer t-shirts every week. I searched for his name. I can’t find him on Facebook.

The last time we spoke, I was a copywriter at an advertising agency. He called my office line everyday. Then I resigned and we lost touch. He was working at Guinness at the time. Relocated to Benin, I think.

He was my first introduction to luxury. The Igbo boy liked to show off. Designer head to toe. He was the first person I knew who chose luxury over comfort.

“When we get married, we will drive expensive SUVs… even if we drink only garri at home,” he would say and kiss my cheeks. 

I thought about that every time I was with him… “Drink garri. Drive SUVs.” Not good. Not good at all.

I wondered if he was living that life now. I shook him out of my head. Grabbed my keys and left the office. I called my boyfriend on my way home. At least some things are still as they should be.

I drove to Shoprite to buy the carton of Oreos I shall be having with ice cream this Ramaddan. I bought wafers for the girls, fried meat, samosa… before I knew it the trolley was full; typical of every shopping experience.

I was checking out a few things when I heard his voice, “Lovely hair you’ve got!”

No, not my school boyfriend, duh! It was Blackky! The 90's musician.

Ah! I haven’t seen him since 2014!

“How are you?” we hugged and stole 45 minutes of time catching up.

I asked if he got royalties for the sample of “Rosie” on Timaya’s track. He said Premiere Records was duly notified and all proper procedures were followed.

He asked about life.  I said life is great. Except that I am dying to go on vacation.

He asked about my love life. I asked about his music.

I talked about becoming 40. He shook his head and said I didn’t look a day older than 34.

I lamented about Nigeria, he followed my cue.

“It is worse for the middle class because we don’t wear our frustration. They don’t let us grieve for this mess called a nation. And people think we should be grateful, which makes it seem like a big sin if you complain. But I have a lot to complain about,” I, well, complained. LOL!

Thankfully he could engage me, which I was grateful for. There’s nothing quite as annoying as having a conversation with someone who reminds you (that) you are better than many people and should just be thankful. 

We talked about Evans. He captured vividly instances of some of the criminal’s activities. We are both shocked any human being and a dog would campaign for his release.

“I think the joke is on all us. God is totally messing with us. Because living makes no sense. So we work hard and make money and remain displeased. And everywhere you go, you still try to find your way. I wanted so badly to move into my new home. Own my own dinning space, and extra rooms… I got that, now I am seeking something else. It’s always going to be that way. What is life, really?” I sighed.

“Find someone who connects with you mentally. Live the rest of your days soaked in warmth and conversation,” he smiled.

Okaaay! That is something I could have said. It sounded like my words. I smiled back.

We hugged, said our goodbyes.

The girls were surprised to see me waiting at the school gate.

“You came back early!”

“My weekend starts now,” I winked.

We went shopping. Then home to eat eba and edikaikong soup.

Now they are eating apples, and I am typing this.

And I am looking forward to nothing.
