The Nigerian Conversation

On Dangote: Don’t trust all these rich men, you don’t know where they get their money from.

On your stupendously rich pastor: It is God. You can’t cage the blessings of Master Jesus.

On Melaye or any other stupid politician: Ah! Baba is just enjoying his life. Carry go jare!

On Ankara: I don’t know why white people will not leave our material alone. It’s not fair. At least use black models to show off Ankara design. They keep stealing from us.

On Feminism: Your husband is the head and not the tail. In the Bible God said...

On Child Sexual Abuse: Chai! God will judge that man! Chai!

On Yahoo Yahoo: Well, everybody is just trying to survive in this world. Don’t jugde. You don’t know what the other person is going through.

On Buhari: I believe that Baba is doing well. His silence is a sign of maturity and inner peace. 

On Bobrisky: At least, Bobrisky has bae that is taking care of him. You – do you have bae?

On Barrenness: The pastor said I should remove my cloth. He inserted his holy finger inside of me. My womb is rejoicing.

On Divorce: God does not like divorce.

On TSTV: Booo DSTV!!! Booooo!!!

On Relationship: He slapped me, what do I do? Hide my identity.

On Marriage: All the single people, let me advise you…

On One Corner Dance: Let us do our own.

On The Bible: Pastor said that...

On online mob action: Ah! She will e-die todaaaay! (bleh!)

On Nigerian miracles (from miraculous childbirth to raising the dead): Don't assume. Don't question, just be happy for them.

On Cheating: Well, I did it only once. So-and-so have done it with ten people.

On Rational Thinking: Why are you so negative and proud? You are not God. Leave this matter.

This is the reason we do not go out for drinks and brunch. It's raining stupid out there.
