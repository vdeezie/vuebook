So I went over to my mum's to tell her I'd be taking a road trip. She was chilling on the balcony with her good friend.

"Whose car?" She asked.

"Mine."

"Why don't you go with his?"

"We've done a trip with his before. Besides, I need to get my tint permit at the destination. It's way cheaper."

"Ah"

"Don't worry I won't be the one driving."

"OK."

"Trust me, mummy," I said, "I won't have anyone drive my car if I didn't know for sure they'd be able to replace the car easily with a newer brand if anything should happen to it."

Her friend chuckled.

"And I won't have anybody drive my car if they can't pay for repairs. He will not only fix the car if anything happens, he'll pay me for the 'trauma' of watching my  poor car go through such an experience.'"

The women threw themselves on the floor.

"My friend, your daughter is funny," mummy's friend said.

"Yes, I really born pikin," mum replied.

I promise to buy her bush meat.
