Unlike the rest of me, I am quite the frugal Editor.

When I started work at Happenings, I was entitled to a phone, of course.

"What phone would you like?" Chairman asked.

"Err..." (I swear, I was going to say something silly like an average Nokia phone with enough smarts to send emails)

"I think you should get an iPhone," Chairman said and brought out a cheque book.

"No. No. Lord, no!"

He looked at me like I fell from the sky.

"No, what?"

"I...I don't want an iPhone."

"Oh?"

I shook my head.

"OK. What do you want then? Is there a better phone out there?"

"No. A Samsung will do."

"I have a Galaxy 4. I used it for a week then I got tired. It's in that drawer. But you should get the latest one," then points his pen on the cheque, again.

"No. No. I can use yours," I said.

"Really? OK then."

Lol! I remember Prisca wanted to give me a headbutt when I told her ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I can't justify an iPhone abeg. Years later and super comfortable, I still can't. 

And that's the theme of my office life. Chairman wants something expensive... Madam Managing Director insists on the cheaper alternative. Lol!

Today it happened again:

"Let's get a Mac bigscreen for the wall so we can view the website and follow it's progress easily," he says. 

"Mac? No. No. LG will do."

"Are you sure? Will it capture every detail on the site?"

"Yes. Yes. LG, please."

"OK, LG it is. Your MD have spoken." And he leaves.

Biko! LG is OK. Lol!

But that is where my frugality stops. I am nothing like that in other ways.

If a boyfriend wants to buy me a Rolex, for instance, there's no way in hell I'll tell him to buy a Timex instead. Whaaaaat??! Buy it jor! Shuuoo!

And when I splurge on my needs... I buy the whole store. Lol!

I think for the office, I realise we are blessed, too blessed... I don't want to squander it.

Little by little. Share the dollar, share the booze.

*I swear, I don't know what that last line is about ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
