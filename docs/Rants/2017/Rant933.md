# Rant933


August 13, 2017

I lived within a few distance from a neighbour once who was extremely annoying. We fought a few times over parking space. One time it took him over an hour to get from his rented apartment to his car parked behind me so I could drive to work. When he finally came down with his ugly frame, he wouldn’t apologise for wasting my time. I told him he was an idiot. He said I was a stupid woman. I told him fuck you. He said “nonsense woman”. I despised him. Greatly. And let me add that I have only been verbally confronted, mainly, by a particular tribe. When you find me exchanging words with a man, it is of a certain tribe. We will drag it out and he too would pull out his own tampon.

He worshipped his wife. You know what that means? It means the woman could never be wrong. This woman, like a cardigan knitted with the dullest wool available, by a grandmother suffering amnesia, was something he believed we all should aspire to. She had no personality; did very little smart work as she was always at home alone. It was constantly hard to tell if she was pretty or not – it depended on the stroke of contour that lifted her cheek bone higher or took it all out with the wrong swipe. When the contour was right, she looked Chinese, when it was bad she nursed the features of a Chihuahua. I didn’t care much for her as my judgment of any woman is not how well she is treated by a man. So she has a paranoid husband who thought she was next to Beyonce, good luck. I would suffocate under such circumstances, anyways. But each to his own.

This post, however, is not about me, it is about what the wife did to another woman who sold bric-a-brac around the neighbourhood. There was an altercation that was kyriarchal. She, by accident, drove into the woman’s knick-knacks and destroyed a few items; cheap things really – a few bottles of groundnut, smashed unwrapped candies and crushed biscuits. It was a tussle of less than N2k.

For shame, I wanted to toss that money into that verbal brawl and let it end, seeing that this ridiculous woman was bent on ridiculing the other woman who didn’t have much of a voice to demand that her items destroyed should be paid for. Everyone else was fighting for her. Nonetheless, wife of the year insisted the woman’s table was too close to the road yada yada, hence she wasn't willing to pay for the damage. 

When her husband got back, the chairman of the close and a few “elders” called his attention to the matter. Husband looked embarrassed only for a second, said he’d handle it. He went to his apartment, fucked his wife, and the next morning he came out to re-enact his wife’s unruliness. Typical of Nigerian couples, really.

“When that woman saw a car coming, why didn’t she move her table? Why is she selling near the gate anyway? Who authorized her selling there? I will inform my friend the Chairman of yada yugu local government. I will write to the deputy state governor. I will solicit for the attention of my friend at Alausa the very reverend engineer architect yugu yudu…”

He told us in plain words that we were all liars trying to frame his wife because we were jealous of their mgbeke love.

Amused by his endless shittiness, I screamed at the man: “Bitch! Pay the woman N2k and shove your illustrious contacts and your wife up your nasty ass.”

Of course, in typical fashion, he turned and said, “Have you seen my nyash before? Is it because you don’t have a man?!”

LMAOOOO!

I mean, this idiot was a top level manager at a bank! 😂😂😂

The idea that the whole world is wrong and your spouse is right is quite cute – only to your spouse. Right here on these streets, we judge based on common sense.

The decent thing to do would be to pay the woman and insist the chairman look into the matter of a table that stays too close to the gate. But to pounce on others whilst trying to protect a mannequin all in a bid to give the impression of love is quite sickening.

In my experience, I hate keeping spouses as friends. It’s either I am a friend of the husband or a friend to the wife. Being friends with a couple and allowing your life become one of their bedroom talk is not something I can stand. I am not your reality show that you switch on for entertainment. When a friend told me her husband wanted to meet me… “he reads your every rant and says I should invite you for lunch sometime. Please come!”

Come fire!

That is never going to work. Not in the Nigerian reality of pretence, over-bloated sense of self, marriage rules and quirks, suspicions and boundaries rolled up high into the sky.

I am not going to work hard to prove to anyone that I am not interested in your husband. I am not going to stifle a smile, hold my breath, keep my hands on my lap, feign a certain level of biblical submission, nod to conversation and remain as a layer of gloss paint on a door just so you can trust that this gesture of letting me into your marital space is something I have to be grateful for. That space is not for me.

I know we need to prove to people that we married the rightest person in the mudafuckin' universe. But when you come out into the world, you need to apply your sense to matters arising.
