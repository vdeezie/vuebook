# Rant962


September 30, 2017

A rough sketch of my day:

I was supposed to be at Light, Camera, Africa early enough to catch Bariga Sugar by 2pm.

When I was done hooking up people who had no business having sex and having babies and falling in and out of love in a script I was writing, it was 12.26pm. But my morning chore wasn't done just yet,  WahalaNow needed to be fed so I spent another hour indulging in my latest obsession. 

Jolade is taking malaria drugs so I had to watch Disney TV with her for a bit before rushing to the bathroom. My neighbour had complained that my second bathroom is leaking again through his bulb, so we have decided to abandon the children's bathroom for now. They get to share mine, and it hasn’t been as uncomfortable as I had thought. 

But I’m going into territories that have no place in this rant, so where was I?

Yes, I shower with Dettol soap which I detest because it leaves my skin feeling like a layer of scraped scales off the back of a fish. Yet for a week I have failed to buy my liquid bath indulgence.

I leave the house by 2pm. If it wasn’t for the effort of putting on mascara, I would change my mind and stay home, grab a bottle of Maltina in my fridge and start the next TV series for the next client waiting. But mascara cannot go to waste, so off I go to Federal palace to catch the remnants of Afia Attack.

But my day had been too convoluted to give me a chance to enjoy the process of warming up to this scenario. So I left LCA, and went into Federal Palace to feast on their buffet. Its N7,000 course and I wanted to have Vera Chidera with me. Coincidentally, she calls me the minute she flashes through my mind. I suspect the aroma of the jollof rice, fish, goat meat peppersoup and hot bread, ice cream, pineapple and diced apples I was about to have was tormenting her wherever she was.

She wanted to make it to the hotel, but food waits for no woman. LOL!

I didn’t start eating until my next client showed up. Actually, trying to catch Bariga Sugar was half the story, the remaining half is Patrick Doyle of legendary filmmaking and Nollywood veteran wanted to meet with me to write him a movie script.

Oh! But y’all didn’t hear me very well. I said… Ok, you did. This is all too surreal for this Edo girl.

He came in flesh, and of course people came around our table to salute and fuss, and for being in his company, it is assumed that I am someone of unusual importance. LOL!

When the world had greeted him, my own people started to show up – awon Facebook followers. Then came this dashing dude. He introduced himself, and said he was a fan. And I laughed and covered my face, because, well, he is cute and he was smiling. And he was genuinely star-struck, which made no sense to me. Who I be? LMAO! 

Inbox things will surely happen with this Yoruba dude.

So I finished my buffet, hated the dessert – cake too sweet, they should put a little hate on it. 

We went to catch the last bit of LCA, but it was over when we got there. 

I’m home now. And I have a lot of work to do.
