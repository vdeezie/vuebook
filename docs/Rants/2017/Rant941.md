When I was younger, my mother would tell me stories of her moment as a young woman hoping to discover life and love.

When she talked about men, she would, on many occasions, describe a "very handsome man" thus:

"If you see am ehn! Yellow man with soft skin. Him voice na like woman wey dey sing. Him dey waka like woman. E dey swing hand - left and right. Red lips. In short him just be like woman. Fiiiiiiiiine man," she'd emphasize. 

Hehe hehe. 

Even as a teenager, I used to wonder how a man (with certain skin colour preference) who talks and walks like a woman could possibly be judged as "fine" or "handsome" in strictly heterosexual conversations. 

I want to hear a deep voice on the phone, please. A little breathy to dispel unnecessary aggression, but definitely nothing high-pitched or I'll begin to laugh.

I want nothing like soft skin. I would notice good skin, yes, and would kiss bare shoulders often as a reward for nice manly grooming; I'll bury my head in his chest...but I don't care for the texture of skin... (leave soft skin for me. I use Clarins, thank you). All I care about is smell. Bad smell destroys everything. 

How he walks shouldn't remind me of any woman. No!

From a heterosexual POV, the physical traits of a man is unique to his gender, biko. 

And if he can "sweat" a little on the job, figuratively... then that's a big bonus.

Zero social media presence = +100

Active social media rancour = - 100,000

Gender neutrality does not exist in my dictionary when it involves sexual attraction.
