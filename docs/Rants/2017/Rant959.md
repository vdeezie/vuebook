A great love story.

In my 20s, the men I liked didn't like me (at least not in the way I wanted).

There'd be two guys standing. You have your eyes on one - the tall (or not-so-tall) dark handsome dude with rough edges, but he has his eyes on someone's backside walking on the other side of the road. You just want to stretch your hands and grab the girl's ass and plaster it on a wall in Iraq, just so he can rid himself of the ass thought and pay you some attention.
Then while you're trying to show that you've got brains, hopping in and out of topics you think should impress him, he still has his gaze on overflowing tits bouncing tirelessly on the other side of the street. 

Then his annoying friend dares to ask you out, and ruins everything. You say "No" so many times, people start to refer to you as a man-hater. But you don't hate men, see? You just want to be with the one you want, not what's available. 

Now you are 40, and when you think a man is hot, he thinks you are hot too. When you want someone, they want you too. When you try on conversation, it fits nicely.

And they aren't looking across the street for something better. Because, well, this is as good as it gets on this green earth ðŸ˜ƒ 

They see you. And they not only want you, they adore you.

A lover said once "I worship the floor you walk on". In many ways he did. He suffocated himself with the chore of making me "happy", I was panting out of exhaustion on his  kind behalf.

ðŸ˜Š

It's so much easier these days.

"Hello."

"Hello."

"I would like to -"

"Can I say something quickly?"

"Sure."

"You are ravishing. And smart. I would love to spend time with you."

And there you are, thinking the same damn thing. 

Or... 

You are  having dinner at a hotel. He is sitting across the room - dashing and dark. You keep that stare. He catches it, and you see it in his eyes that he thinks you are fancy too.

And you both wear that faint smile. Not one word exchanged, but something happened to you, and you'll be smiling all day.

A love story. Life's simple pleasures.
