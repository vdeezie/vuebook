LMAO! Me I will share this one oh!

So a friend tells me about a dude she’s about to date on social media. She wants my opinion. I say my opinion shouldn’t count, but she insists, so here we are!

She gives me a name and tells me to check him out. "If you were to make an appraisal of him via social media, what would it be?” Na so she ask me oh.

So I check out the profile…

Dude takes a lot of selfies. In his bedroom (which looks like it needs a layer of fresh paint, and that curtain needs to be washed like last year), takes selfies in random bathrooms that should clearly not inspire anyone to think of selfies. He takes pictures of himself about to have a meal. And he has captions like: “living the life.”

I kid you not. LOL!

When he’s not busy getting a kick out of selfies in a canteen, he is sharing a hundred and one messages – from spiritual quotes to political rumours. 

Then I noticed he shares posts from Gossip Mill, that was when I laughed out loud. I skipped over to the page and  found a few of his comments… ON GOSSIP MILL, under posts like: “Chidinma exposes leg on vacation in Zanzibar.”

WTF! 

Then I run through his wall and see where he shared a post and wrote his thoughts: “Let me grab my popcorn. Hehehe.”

A guy grabs e-popcorn ready for e-gossip. Na mehn! C’mon! 

So I report back to this friend oh! And I tell her I wouldn’t near this one with a long stick. But that’s just me, I like a certain type of men. 

Then she starts to para, “But isn’t that sexist? Why can’t he put a flower on his head and be a garden? Why can’t he drop comments on Gossip Mill? Why can’t he take selfies in dirty toilets? Why can’t he love e-wars and grab e-popcorn? Don't women do the same?”

But ayam not dating women nah! i don't care about women.

You asked for my opinion, and I gave you an honest one. I’m not going near a man with half the shit going on in that one’s e-life. 

Now she is upset that I judged the man she wants to date on dirty selfies and Gossip Mill addiction. I am just "shook" that she is even attracted to something like that.

Moral of story: Don't get opinions from anyone regarding the D. We don't care unless it's pepperoni chopped and screwed in pizza.
