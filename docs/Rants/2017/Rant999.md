Dear Parents,

I think it is important, every once in a while, to tell our children...

"No matter what goes wrong in the world, just know that I love you. Whether I am here or not, know that I will always love you. And I believe in you and the process you will take that will lead you to failure or success in life."

If you do this every other day till they are 21, you'd have raised a more confident child who is inclined to success, irrepressible, buoyant, kind (definitely not in the Nigerian way), and open to accepting knowledge and new ways of thinking.

And those words, you'll discover, would be more important than any knowledge they gather in school.

Good luck ‚ù§
