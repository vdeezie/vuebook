My electrician is good. He is efficient. That's it. He knows his job. He understands his job. He has a profound relationship with wires and cables and sockets and bulbs and all that stuff. He can fix just about any electrical mystery, and carries about his business with the swiftness of an arrow.

You know how you have someone in your house and you can't wait for the work to be done so they can carry their work bags and never return? For reasons you can't really explain. They just need to leave your house so you can breathe again. Probably why I am yet to fix my curtains. I still have pegs holding both ends to the iron rod. Ridiculous, really. I simply detest having workmen in my house! I have to prepare for that intrusion. And sometimes I need an entire year! 

However, with my electrician it's all good. He works around my house without intruding in my personal space or making me uncomfortable.

He is not that artisan that hums religious songs or makes loud uncouth calls that gives the impression he owns the place.

I remember some bloody artisan who did a passing job and left a silly comment on his way out. I had asked him to help with a stiff door. The paint was still damp and it was pretty tough for me to open.

He took this rare opportunity to say, "That is why it is good to have a man in the house."

Just to open a door? Hian! Stupidity fall on you.

My electrician, however, doesn't come with that silly vibe... and thankfully doesn't wear a bad smell. For someone with no fancy education, he is quite the professional. 

So anyways, half the lights in my house went off two nights ago. I called. He told me to try a few tricks. Didn't work. So he came around the next day.

As he was fixing stuff, he said, "I'll miss church today. This work will make me miss worshipping God tonight."

So I told him...

"See the way you work. See how you move from one cable to the other. How you connect the dots with electrical precision. See the passion you give to your job. See how you light up my space... that is the greatest worship you can give to God. If truly you believe He created you, then excelling with your skill the way you do is Worship. That you live in the fullness of your purpose is the worship you owe God."

He smiled and continued fixing those wires.

Even I had to think about the words I said, later ðŸ˜ƒ
