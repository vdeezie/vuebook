There is a school in Ajegunle.

The people call it Umbrella school.

It is a place of learning and a place of joy, you berra take me to Umbrella school.

Taaaaaake me to Umbrella School.

Taaaaaake me to Umbrella School.

Taaaaaake me to Umbrella School.

You berra take me to Umbrella School.

That was my primary school anthem. 

In my crisp light blue dress, I would sing that song like it was Dolly Parton's hottest track.

Then one day, they forbade us to sing the anthem on the assembly ground.

Why?

Because "Ajegunle". Not good branding for the school.

Hian! 

But that school could compete with any British-Nigeria, Turkish-Lekki academic shenanigan. I am sure it has lost its lustre now like everything in Nigeria does, but it was a fantastic school in the 80s. 

Ajegunle or no Ajegunle.

Then they tried to weave in "Olodi Apapa" into the song (since it was actually located in Olodi Apapa), but it didn't werk. So they got rid of the school anthem entirely. 

Made no sense to a child. After all, my desk-mate was a Chinese girl. Many of the students traveled to Europe during holidays. We had teachers from Ohio to Ghana. 

So what does it matter if it was located in Olodi Apapa?

The school occupied a vast land space. Our playground is as big as the refurbished amusement park (at least in the eyes of a child). And we topped charts during interschool debates (and other competitions).

But for a location, school stayed "humble"... unsure it had full rights to be great. Even with all its students from across the world... when greatness came, they shrunk.

Because "Ajegunle".

I haven't been there in a long while. But the Olodi Apapa I knew... I miss it everyday. 

PS: Just like I do my secondary school, LASMOCK. I met it almost squeaky new. The entire school had just about 600 students when I was there. 

I went there last year to dole out cash and inspiration to graduating students... 

And what did I find? 

Over 4,000 students occupying the same space we did back then. A true wreck. Poor representation. Dirt. Scum. Zero development.

I cried.

If you understand what LASMOCK represents in my life... Without it I wouldn't be anything. 

It hurt me to see it that way. 

I gave out money, got home and cried.
