The aboki in my neighbourhood...

He washes up to 5 cars a day. One wash is N300. That's N1,500 daily.

He fetches water for more than 10 households daily. That should be approximately N1,000 daily.

Other odd jobs like washing clothes can add an extra N500 to his daily fee.

In a day, the uneducated aboki makes N3,000.

His lifestyle is cheap. He has no new clothes, he doesn't pay rent, and doesn't eat at fancy restaurants. He probably spends less than N500 daily. 

He makes close to N15,000 a week. And more than N50,000 a month.

Little drops of consistent hardwork.

***
Omawumi said something some years back during an interview...

"I don't understand stark poverty," she said, "If music fails, I will go into the market and sell tomatoes carrying my child on my back!"

I can't forget that.

***
I stood by my window this morning watching that aboki jump from one car to the other, washing and cleaning.

I am so proud of his hardwork.

So many educated people need that money... but they are waiting for Dangote to employ them as Managers. 

Which isn't such a bad dream. But if you've waited this long... may be you need to wash cars.

With your education, it could be a car wash stopover. 

I don't know.

Let this inspire whom it is meant to inspire... the rest of you, "how market? "

Bye bye.
