I was driving with my girls to get pillows and cases, buckets and roll-on for their new academic experience when Gbemi (on BeatFM) said something on radio with respect to the International Day of the Girl Child. 

She said:
“Teach your girls about equality and breaking glass ceiling… EVEN IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE REALLY DOING.”

That defines me to a great degree. Half the time, I am not sure if certain decisions would lead to anywhere, but what I am very certain of is never going back, not looking back, and never negotiating situations that are glaringly insolent.

I walked around like a robot buying stuff. And it is ok, really. It is ok not have it all figured out. As long as I do not feel trapped, caged or lacking in power or choices; walking around my decisions aimlessly is not bad at all. I know how to pick the pieces and make a masterpiece. You can call me Pablo Picasso.

I tell my girls big things. I share an impossible world to them. I tell them what they can achieve almost at an unattainable height. I don’t have to know what I am really doing or saying, as long as I am not telling them to be defined only by marriage or dream small so that the opposite sex will find their small, non-threatening dreams appealing… as long as I don’t tell them to live in fear of what people would say, or cower in the presence of authority, then I am on the right path.

So as I walk around buying stuff, preparing them for a new chapter... I don’t fully know what the future holds. But I know the past, I have power and authority over the past; and I know, as always, not to think the past can ever be better than what we can paint and draw in our future.
