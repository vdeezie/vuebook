All we do is talk talk talk.

We jump, scratch and yell virtually. The next day, we repent. Thanking all the "wonderful people in our lives" for holding us back from doing (more) harm. 

Nothing is sustained. Nothing achieved. More talk. Then a lot of image laundry. Pour Ariel, add water, make those clothes a little brighter.

Oh! Our good lives interrupted by this issue. Now we are angry. Now we must react. Now "friends" must gather and cheer on. Or beg on. All the while gauging the heat from the other end. 

Hold seminars, inbox. Build your support system. Come out and claim you are a woman with a mind of your own. Yet have not made one stubborn decision that didn't require constant prodding and cheers and support and gbams. 

Write another 100 posts related to the first.

Justify why you got mad. Why you tore your bra. Then why you had to repent later. Sew that bra.

Oh the zillion inbox message of love! How can you hurt these people who love you so. You must do this for them. You must stop this. This rage. However justified, must be made to chill, like Coke meeting NEPA. 

Then you must come out to preach to the rest of the cyber world. Of this great love and support.

"I hope you all have people who can sew your bras for you? Because if you have no one who can talk to you, you are missing out of the greatness of life."

(No, we don't. We are spiders)

The theme changes quickly. Now we are talking about people who do not have brassiere tailors.

Someone. Anyone. Must be shamed. Who can can we shame now? 

Move the focus from your appalling drama immediately.

Call out a Facebook friend. Thank him/her for sharing undiluted wisdom sometime in 1976; and teaching you common sense you can apply in 2017.

Friend, please grab your award. Applause. Applause.

Balance your post. Make sure everyone you wish to keep on your radar is well represented.  

Tell us about your life - how your choices turned out EXACTLY the way you wanted.

Eg: "From day one, I have always wanted to ride a bicycle to work. It is what I want. If I wanted a car, I'll get it. This is my choice."

Of course, this is in response to an attack on people who probably don't drive cars.

There's always a response. Always an outrage of the most inconsequential bullshit.

Yet people buy into this crap every other day. 

Find as many subs as you can. Drop your "gbams" to assure your ego and shattered esteem that the posts aren't about you. These are your people. They stand by you. They must be subbing the next person. Not you.

Tell yourself that over and over again as you do the chicken wing dance.

Tell us a story later. Something about turning a man or an engagement proposal down is usually the greatest image boost for these women.

Get all the stupid comments in.

"You deserve better jor." "Correct woman!" 

Now try to connect all the dots you have littered everywhere...

From getting mad over a post. To retaliating on your own wall. To finding solidarity. To "gbamming" on as many rejoinders as you can lay your eyes on. Greatest Facebookites cheering you on. Inbox "wisdom aunties and  uncles" rebuking and loving you all at once. YOU feeling like a lucky "kid" with all the wonderful grown-ups in your life. Then a summary of your cool life.

Then somewhere in all of these, remind us of all your choices AGAIN, and how proud you are of them.

Clap for yourself.
