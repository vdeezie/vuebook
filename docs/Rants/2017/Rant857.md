"Rat Gum" doesn't catch rats.

The last time it caught a rat was probably 3 years ago. 

Tell the truth, when was the last time that "mouse gum" snagged a rat?

This invention is obsolete. 

But trust Nigerians, we still sell and we still buy.

We hurry to China to produce same product in the same outdated design year in year out. As if led by a dumb spirit.

If this was an "American business"... recognising that the rats have evolved, the product would go through many stages of improvement. 

It could be that the yellow board is distracting. How about a black board?

Is the gum repulsive to rats? Can we make it  smell like roses instead, to lure them in? Or maybe smell like crayfish. Anything but that damp smell reminiscent of an archaic invention of 1985!

The rat gum isn't catching any rats!

I saw with my own two eyes a tiny rat move stealthily beside a gum trap!

Amazing stunt, I tell you.

My new apartment came with a tiny rat. I have seen it twice, in the kitchen, looking for what to do or eat, how it could be useful.

It's so small, if you blink you could swear it was a black spot caused by too much light.

But I am not fooled. It is indeed a rat.

I have the rat gum lying there for over two weeks. Every morning, I peep through the kitchen door. Nothing. Gum still as yellow as the sun. It hasn't even caught a roach. 

What to do?

I buy another failed "invention" - The Rat Poison.

When the seller handed it to me, I looked at it, a very unattractive meal.

"Do I add crayfish to it?" I ask

"No. It is already mixed with food."

A mixture similar to what little children cook with empty tins. Of stones and sands. Except this one has a smell - an awful smell.

"If you were a rat would you eat this?" I asked the seller.

Why can't they sell me something that can actually kill a rat. A tiny rat, not bigger than a thumb!

Now my kitchen is fortified:

1) Three rat gum boards 

2) Rat poison in small portions at 4 different locations.

Two weeks counting. Nothing has happened. I suspect nothing will. 

I'm sure it passes by every night, wondering: "when will these humans grow some sense?"

Rats are apparently (more) advanced than the inventions made by humans to destroy them.

Be humble. Salute to the more advanced animal.

Sieg Heil!
