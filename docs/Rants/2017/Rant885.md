A notorious criminal/kidnapper was caught. So notorious he once collected a ransom of one million dollars. Owns posh houses. And through crime, he funds a bourgeoisie lifestyle for his family abroad. 

And what do we have in the news, occupying paper space and data time...

His wife begging for forgiveness!

She reminds us that her husband, a billionaire kidnapper, leads prayers in the house. She tells us that he reads Psalms. She wants us to know he goes to church. And he loves God. 

And somewhere in her luxury Canada mansion, she gathers her children, gives a cue, and they all start a performance - they cry, she takes a selfie. Posts on social media. 

She tells us her prayerful husband doesn't smoke or drink. Because in our deceitful nature, this is all we need to do to be free of judgment:

1) Pray
2) Don't Smoke
3) Don't Drink

If we keep to those 3 commandments, we are free of any blemish or offence and we should be forgiven always.

Yet this shit is trending. 

Didn't Evans promise to be born again? Just after a few days of arrest? A crook who knows the right words to say to a religious society. 

I'm sure some people went, "awww, the Lord be praised" when they read that. You are all sick in the head.

In our typical dunce nature, one twerp argued for Evans' release based on Saraki's acquittal.

We think in dark boxes. It is always a game of comparisons. It is impossible to fetch any sensible argument from these Nigerians. 

What the world requires for growth and development is mental/intellectual grind... and Nigerians are by far the laziest when it comes to cerebral engagements... we shall remain this way. In deep shit.

Don't be shocked if this "spousal appeal" also "touches" the hearts of the Nigerian Police and the Justice system. Evans may just get a light sentence - a few handsome years in a "prison", but what he'd really be in would be "house arrest" with all necessary comforts. 

This country... tueh!
