I sincerely can't fathom going to the market, spending two hours or more cooking for myself. Alone. Just me and food, all cooked and stored in the fridge. 

Do you know how many pages of a screenplay I'll write in two hours? 

Meat alone takes about 35 minutes to boil. Then I have to grate okro. And if I'm too much of a Nigerian woman, I'll blend the tomatoes and cut the ugu by myself.

Just so I, alone, can eat?

It's too much time wasted. I can't live that routine. Not at this time of my life. Open market is a chore. 

Except I am cooking for my kids then I make weekly orders delivered to my home. Real home cooking. I get to help another woman's business as people have helped mine. And there's always eggs in my fridge. Yam. Plantain. Pepperoni. We can create a colourful and an exciting meal in just a few minutes. Then move on to something else.

Maybe when I get into a live-in/married situation I can dedicate some time every other week for cooking. But it can't be a routine. One of our ambitions would be to explore the epicurean lifestyle. 

It takes just 30 minutes to get well cooked seafood okro from yellow chilli, for instance.  Why would I want to go catch the prawn myself at coastal waters? I am not a chef nah. Food is not that deep for me. I have never judged myself based on how well I can cook, since I don't make a dime from cooking. Nonetheless, I do cook well, but that's not the point.

The point is... time is the real investment. I don't have time.

I eat good food. I can afford it. It doesn't have to come from my kitchen.
