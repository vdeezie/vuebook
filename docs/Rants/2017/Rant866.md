The only time I prayed with a man was in a marriage.

I don't pray with boyfriends. 

The few times boyfriends asked that we pray, I refused.

One time, I laughed so hard, I almost pee-d. How can you pressure me to pray with you in a relationship? I will cheer you on, motivate you, build with you... but I will not bring God into a fucking relationship (pun intended). 

We are satisfying flesh - what the eyes can see, and ears can hear; meeting our needs. We are having delicious sin... where does God come in?

For some it is a way of accepting their amazing wretchedness in the sight of God. It helps them feel better about their actions. At this point they are immune to wrongdoing... and have attained "a higher level of grace".

I cannot stand being a hypocrite.

So you pray, not for forgiveness, but for some selfish need you want from God... OR to impress your partner, so they think of you as "godly" - the most important label we need to wear to be qualified as good people. 

But you are fucking. And praying. And fucking some more. Some of you are cheating on your spouses.  

How do you reconcile this with your faith?

You have sex and then you pray to a God, who insists fornication is out of line, to bless you.

We smash and then we thank God for his Love.

We think this is a humble surrender of our constant sins to whom we serve. That we are able to match our prayers with our sins make us better than others. 

I think there's a place in hell reserved for those who mock God.

And the mockers of God are "Nigerian Christians" who feel the need to pray their way to a premeditated act of sin (e.g: a healthy dose of fornication and adultery, with lubes to boot).

The next hottest part of hell should be reserved for those who blame the devil for everything. For raping a 5 months old child. For killing their domestic employer just to steal N200k from her wardrobe. For beheading their cousins. These ones are the first born of depravity. 

The devil is not omnipresent. You know that, right? All your sins are saut√©ed to perfection by your own will.

I read a conversation between a married man and his girlfriend...

They have anal sex regularly it seems. She says she won't be around this weekend for (more) anal sex as she is bleeding presently from the anus. He promises to send her N600k. She is elated. All of a sudden she forgets she is bleeding. They are meeting for another anal rendezvous. He tells her not to have sex with her boyfriend because he needs her to be...err, firm. She agrees...

But first, she needs to go to church. 

LMAO!

That sums up the life of the average Nigerian Christian.

Do you know in all the years I have watched Crime and Investigation, there's not one serial killer, rapist, paedophile, or con artist that blamed the devil for his actions? They accept they are sociopaths and they head to jail to serve time.

That's intergity.

Have some integrity.

When you go naked by midnight to curse a boyfriend for hurting you, which God are you praying to?

You are fucking. Getting hurt is one of the rewards of pleasing the flesh.

Deal with it.
