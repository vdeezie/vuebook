I am unrepentantly apolitical. I believe a country should be able to run itself in the hands of local politics and leadership without regular citizens poking their noses into the daily activities of the state, monitoring the activities of their taxes. I believe corruption exist, but it should not greatly disrupt the lifestyle of citizens.

This is why I am angry. For the first time in my life, I can see the consequences of bad leadership and political indiscretions. I am a law-abiding citizen who just wants to live a good life. I do not have to care so much about politics to enjoy the regular rewards of a good state. That is why we have government officials to worry on our behalf.

I have never voted. Until I truly believe in a candidate, I will not throw my vote to Peter just to overthrow or spite Paul.

I have never protested. What for? I strongly believe that is not the solution to our problems. Maybe someday I will. But I move with my convictions. 

It takes one hooligan to grab a lady's purse in a crowd of people protesting for good governance. The lady screams. Tries to get her purse back. Hoodlum runs through the crowd. Gets attention. One man tries to stop him. Another hooligan sends him to the ground with a blow. One man grabs at the hooligan's trouser. Chaos. Anger. Stab wounds. Police. Trigger happy. Tear gas. Blood.

For what? For a country that will not remember to mourn your death when you are gone? 

Gani Fawehinmi. Fela. Keshi.

Who do we honour? What do we remember?

I am not afraid to die. I negotiate my death with God every day. But God forbid that I die for this country.

Like subs and shades that last only a few days, your death will be a convenient topic...and a prayer point.

I will die for what I believe in. And I do not believe in Nigeria.

We are too hungry to protest... no scratch that, we are too corrupt to protest successfully. 

You'll be out there with placards, yet the person beside you is a paid agent to snoop and aggravate the cause. People are paid to lead an entire movement astray. Sometimes with a gallon of palm oil, or bag of rice as reward. Or promises of juicy contracts.

Fuel subsidy. I was in my house. Looking at the ceiling. When the reports of corruption and bribery sufficed, I dusted my dress and returned to work.

Now this protest. What is the plan? Apart from regular social media users... does the vulcanizer by the corner of the road know what this is all about? What about the barber, the shoemaker, the conductor, ugu seller, street trader... when they find you on the streets, can they connect to the issues that brought you out of your screens to their reality?

Have you forgotten that they are the majority and you are a trifling minority?

Have you forgotten how easily this majority can be bought and used?

Have we had town hall meetings in Ajegunle and Makoko, Mafoluku and Ikotun? Have we educated these ones?

You and your android phone with data are disconnected from the truth and reality of society.

There's no international model we can follow; because there's no country quite as unique as Nigeria, where you eat your legs to satisfy your stomach.

What really upsets me about these "Buharist" is the absolute conviction they had when they voted this tyrant in.

Buhari failed in 1985. Was kicked out of office like scum. He imprisoned and frustrated one of the most vocal Nigerians, Fela.

So on what grounds did you need to convince the rest of Nigerians to vote for him?

What offends me is how they bullied anyone with a different choice. They mocked the Kowa candidate. Called GEJ a pig... ran their shit like a cult. It is always about forming cliques in Nigeria.  

For what? Just to bring this dunce into power.

Now they are quiet. Look at Tolu Ogunlesi. Look at Red Media. Look at all those who made it seem like they finally found a messiah.

As in... people forgave this man for killing their loved ones, just so they can get him into power. WTF! Are you people mad?

Some swore on their mother's kidney, and the wombs and/or virility of their spouses that Buhari was the One. As if they were his testicle that followed him wherever he went.

How did you come to that conclusion that he could deliver? Any records to show exceptional leadership? 

Now we are here, at the worst time of our lives, yet people need to defend their choices.

You are reprobate!

I don't know about a protest... what Nigeria does is call a few of the vocal individuals and the main group (e.g: Enough is Enough) and grease a few palms.

Protest over. A few have been empowered, compromised. 

You sweat under the sun just so a few can get government "invitation". 

I think not.

The only solution is to get a worthy candidate(s) ready for 2019.

Tope Fasua and ANRP, where is your candidate? Onyeka and the party he promotes, where is your candidate? KOWA and-your-lack-of-zeal-until-time-for-elections, where the hell is your candidate?

We don't want Atiku, we don't want any rotten meat from APC or PDP.

This is the time to get sponsors to back up new ideals.

Start town hall meetings NOW! Start educating average Nigerians NOW!! 

I will vote and put my life on that one vote if only I truly believe it will save the country of my children.
