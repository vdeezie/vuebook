Hanging out with Vera and Prisca last night, we got talking about, well, life.

Somewhere along that journey through life, we stopped over at 2008.

That year, Prisca got married. 
Vera was in school. 
And I was an editor of a magazine and had just bought a brand new Honda City.

We were at different phases in our lives. We didn't know each other then. Yet almost ten years later, here we are sharing our experiences and unwrapping the years, the stories and the lessons. 

One year. There women. Different phases. Life lessons.

It's a beautiful thing, this life. A beautiful yet scary journey, all made possible with courage, faith in oneself, and mental strength.

2008, Prisca was getting married. Vera was in a special science school in Anambra. And me? An editor at Genevieve magazine. 

Have the years been good to us individually? Oh yes.

Presently, Prisca has a career in mobile technology. Vera has a thriving restaurant. And I have all that I have as a writer. 

Friends analysing a year that they were strangers, like flipping through a book - unravelling the other woman's story. 

A year crystallized into beautiful memories.
