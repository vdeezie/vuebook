A typical child-shaming session happened yesterday at the neighbourhood supermarket while I got my knick-knacks.

One of the sales girls was told to kneel in front of the store, as four women talked down at her, snapping fingers, shouting incoherently; in a circle like a pond, creating a nuisance to my inner peace as I shopped.

I put my nose in after 10 minutes of trying to ignore the hoopla.

“What’s going on?”

Their responses fell all over the place; after a few minutes, still not sure what it was they were yapping about, one voice finally stood out. It was the voice of the complainant – a customer, mother to a teenage girl who was caught sending text messages to a boy to meet up at the cinema.

The girl is fifteen years old. But she wasn’t the one made to kneel in public. 

Apparently, her mother traced the episode (of her daughter trying to meet up with a boy) to the doorstep of the neighbourhood grocery store. The daughter had told her mother that the sales girl – also a 15 year old girl – was the mastermind behind the hookup.

So mother came with all her venom to scream and punish the girl who dared to corrupt her daughter – a mere sales girl in a grocery store.

Of course, it wasn’t presented that way. It was presented in a way that is quite Nigerian – the mother was here to ensure that the sales girl confess and also repent from her “waywardness” and from her knack for recruiting innocent mates to her perverse ways. 

The woman shared this tale, believing I would naturally sign up to the shaming and bashing of a 15 year old. You know, the wrath of yet another woman/mother who would further shut the girl down and reduce her to a speck of dust.

I laughed and dragged a long hiss.

“You people must be joking,” I spat. 

“How?” the mother/complainant asked.

“First off, young lady, GET UP!” I said to the 15 year old.

“WHY?!” the complainant threw her hands up.

“Why are you punishing her for something YOUR child did?”

“Because she was the one who introduced the boy to my daughter.”

(Yes, the sales girl admitted she did; but that was after she couldn't handle the constant harassment from this woman's daughter. The boy, apparently, attends same school with the sales girl.)
 
“How can you be so sure of that?", i asked, "Shouldn’t commonsense tell you that your daughter was afraid and trying to save face?”

“I know my daughter; she would never have thought of this on her own!”

“How old is the boy in question?”

“They are all fifteen years old.”

Now this woman wants to believe (and also get us to agree) that her daughter was coerced by someone else to meet up with a boy. I think it is a Nigerian thing: the-other-child-of-another-parent-is-the-bad-one.

“You have no right to humiliate this child. I have two girls, and I would kill someone if they ever dragged them out in public like this and accused them of something as frivolous as SPEAKING WITH A BOY,” I said.

I mean…WTF!

What really do teenagers do except try to finish their homework, watch TV, read interesting books, and chat up girlfriends and boys? It is a natural, healthy practice for a 15 year old girl to want to hang out with a boy she likes. Or do we want to pretend they don’t nurse crushes??? You can’t kill that desire; what you should do is caution the child with the present realities of insecurity, date rape, kidnapping, and heartbreak. Share everyday news and report, so it builds a wall around their affection for the opposite sex. You don’t try to kill that affection, you will never win. Don’t build fear; construct logic around that natural human desire that they feel. 

What are we even talking about? If you have a 15 year old child and she isn’t trying to hang with a guy OR chat up a guy on WhatsApp OR look good for a schoolmate - probably the head boy or social prefect or a rebellious hot teen in SS2… then you need to be worried.

I wasn’t any of this though… they call people like us weird. Weird isn’t normal. 

Don’t expect your children to be weird. A healthy teenager should want to do many things!

So I told the woman to accept that her daughter LIKES A BOY and WANTS TO HANGOUT WITH A BOY. She doesn't have to, but she wants to. You, as the parent, shouldn't necessarily agree to it, but don't act like it's an alien thought.

Ah! Y’all needed to have seen her reaction; she went on a rant on how decent her children are. How her first child is happily married at 20. How her second daughter (the 15 year old) is an intelligent child… yada yugu.

I wanted so much to slap her! 

Your 20 year old child is married. In 2017, we still count that as some achievement. 

“So why isn’t your daughter here to kneel beside her friend who hatched the plan?” I mocked.

“They are not friends,” she frowned, “she only buys stuff here. That’s how she was able to convince her to see the boy.”

You could see how much she despised the sales girl – like she was nothing. 

I was the only one eager to save the girl. And I could see it in her eyes – her gratitude. Poor child.

“What’s in it for this sales girl if the boy sees your daughter?” I asked.

“I don’t know oh, my sistah!”
 
At that point, I'd had enough.

“Madam, your daughter likes the boy. The sales girl says she was badgering her to make the introductions, how come you aren’t picking up on that part of the story?”

“Because I know my daughter.”

“Yes, of course, you know your daughter. If the mother of this girl is here, she’d say the same thing about hers. But she is stuck with a madam who just wants to please you – her customer. She didn’t do anything wrong, nor did your daughter. Young people do these things. Young people hang out”

“Madam, please!!! Don’t talk like that!” she was getting angry as she discovered she was losing this entire episode she had cooked up. The other women weren’t as angry anymore with the sales girl. Sense was gradually sipping in.

“I don’t know how you bring up your daughters, that’s your business… but I will train my children well,” she spat.

“Then go home and train your child and leave this girl alone! She did nothing wrong.”

“Madam!” she called out to the owner of the store, “Do you support this?”

“No vex, aunty,” the owner pleaded with her. “I will deal with my girl.”

The complainant left the building, and we sighed.

Then the owner of the store turned to me and said…
“Aunty, that woman daughter…hmm! Na very useless girl. But I nor want make she think say I dey support my sales girl.”

Lobatan.
