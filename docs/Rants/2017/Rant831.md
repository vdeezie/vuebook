Only in religion will you find a man- smart, employed, architect, well-travelled, sound in politics, able to hold conversation on diverse issues...

Married to a woman- brilliant, career driven, successful consultant, teaches in renowned business schools, stylish, follows international trends...

Both of them resourceful, excelling... YET submitting to the personal doctrines paraded as biblical truths from a University graduate pastor who has never held a job, never worked for money (except demand for tithes), never paid tax, never read a book beyond the Bible and cheap motivational materials, with no true intention to grow, to learn, to broaden scope...

The pastor controls the mind, the home, the finances of people whom he should naturally be serving tea every morning in an ideal society.

This couple talks about everything, dissect every news, hold smart opinions about world issues...

But after church, after another gruelling exercise of fitting into a mediocre cult system... they are too afraid to question or dissect teachings from the mouth of someone too small to tie their shoe laces, doctrines littered with personal opinions from a man who just wants to drive big cars, live in big houses without working for it; and fuck fat ass women without being judged.

These activities are funded by the sweat and knowledge of smart couples like these one.

It is a mystery.

What really do you think you can find in a man who has less of everything that you are. And if at all he can feed now, your money made it possible.

Fear is a dangerous thing. Spiritual blackmail trumps every evil.

Just this afternoon I told my girls, "I do not want you to ever be afraid of anything or anyone."

Fear will cripple all the knowledge you have spent over two decades building. It mocks all the experiences you have garnered visiting over 15 countries of the world.

Fear reduces you to a frightened little child with nothing but knickers on.

Fear will eventually cause you death.
