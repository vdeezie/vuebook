Dear Millenial, 

Let's talk about writing and making money.

You will not make money parading as a ghost writer. That genre suffers drought for lack of paying clients. 

You'll get picked like a wrap of ugu, your talent bargained like tomatoes. 

Unless of course your client is a politician with oil money floating in his bank account, or a top executive of a flourishing conglomerate.

However... they won't come looking for you. They have Toni Kan.

You will not make money hustling as a writer. But that depends on what "money" represents. If you are content with N60k every other month, by all means, hustle. But remember you can't pay rent or pay bills beyond food and transportation on that cheque.

You'll be broke most of the time. 

Dream bigger.

There are no hidden costs in writing. No abracadabra. We know where the money in writing lives.

If Ad agencies want copywriters, they hire them. We do not run a system that outsources writing. 

Nigerians are yet to admit that writing is a professional job. Nollywood producers hire their OND cousins to quickly write scripts. Nobody edits.
Subtitles are riddled with "hairy snails" and atrocious sentences.

They don't care much for your talent. You are not in their budget. Their nieces and their side chicks can write a script.

Have you ever been in a meeting with a prospect telling you... "I am busy, if not I can write this thing myself"?

 That's your talent spat on.

You cannot make money writing on Facebook. And unfortunately you can't even make money running a blog. You are not top 10 on alexa ratings. You'll make some money, get freebies and invitation to places, yes. You may begin to think this will grow.

No, it won't.

Money is being made, but it is not yours. Stop being inspired by Linda. She has this game on a lock down. Find something else.

Blogging is stagnant water. Soon it starts to stink, and you start to grow weary. Writers who run successful blogs are writers who have other jobs away from writing.

So move on, stop struggling where plant won't grow.

Linda, like the eclipse of the moon, may not happen to you in your lifetime. 

You may get a few cool writing gig, sometimes these clients will trust you with PR. So you serve as writer/publicist. They keep you for a year or two, pay you a drop of water from their ocean. 

Moving forward, your contract expires. They hire someone of your talent, feed them with your role and pay that person a salary.

You are back to square one, hustling.

Hustling is a tough lonely depressing broke job.

We do not have a vibrant freelance industry that pays well.

Here's how you can make money as a writer:

Scriptwriting pays very well. Stretch your imagination. Read up on how to write scripts for TV. Then... GO GET A JOB as a scriptwriter. 

If you learn how to write screenplays, then learn how to write stageplays too. It pays. 

If you are witty, you can write for a website. At Happenings for instance, I have freelance writers on my pay list who earn up to N80k per month sometimes. And this isn't a full time job. Others earn N40k.

If you find that kind of gig, don't mess it up. Keep that N40k coming in every month. Save your stupid ego for the agebro on the street.

Writers need to relax on the need to flex their "rights". Nobody wants to "chop" your money. At least not me.  Find your enemies and brag. If you have a site paying you for writing, relax with the collar-popping. Thing is, with all your gra gra you will lose the paying gig, and life goes on. Dispensable you. 

I have long settled within myself that anyone who pays me money isn't an enemy. Money is a big deal. Money covers shame. Money heals. I will save my cockiness for other people and other purposes.

So here we are...

Copywriting pays. 
Scriptwriting pays. 
Writing for a media company that makes profit, pays.

If you want to die of hunger, publish a book and wait for it to feed you.

You can sell 120 tickets for a 'Story of my Vagina' Play in 4 weeks at N2,500 per ticket...

But you may not be able to sell 100 copies of 'Story of my Vagina' book at N1000 in 4 weeks.

As a writer, look for where people are willing to put their money.

Sometimes, you get lucky... your hustle gets the attention of international media and programs.

Actually, it is not luck. It is damn good writing...

It is Oris Aigbokhaevbolo. It is Dami Ajayi. It is Temidayo Ahanmisi.

These are the type who get called to represent West Africa in, say, Australia. 

They may not own their own landed property, but they get to travel all over the world and do badass things with a pen and a laptop. (One of them is living that life already. I think).

But you are not them, your writing is beautiful and nice, no doubt; and that should be enough to get you paid enough to sponsor your own vacation.

It is tough to succeed only as a writer in Nigeria. Many of the writers you admire have other jobs. The rest are forging figures.

Go get a job, dear Millenial. A writing job. Or get a job and write later.

Or som'tin.

PS: This is just a rant, of course, pay no attention. And this shouldn't be your cup of tea if you are writing Alakija's memoirs or Adenuga's biography. Waka pass.
