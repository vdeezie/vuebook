# Rant920

I tried getting a mentor once. It turned out a disaster.

That would be the only time I truly wore the cloak of submission, and wanted to learn under (not learn from) someone, and allow her influence my decisions. 

I did what I never do - I travelled to meet her. The only time I make trips is for businesses that cannot be negotiated on phone (Think launching of a star hotel and I am the publicist kind of situation). Yes, I will hop on a plane and move. The other time I make trips is to see a man I love or interested in.

Business (that cannot be transacted via available technology) and Love. Every other interaction that ignores the advantage of technology will have to wait until Jesus comes.

Nigeria is not safe. And since I am not a waka traveller across the country (which is a valid pursuit, by the way), I expect people to use available technology to engage and interact. 

After that visit she became increasingly impatient and suspicious. I wasn't sure what triggered that. I was going to run PR for her project. She didn't have a problem giving me the cheque, but when I got back to base it was one annoying call after another, with idiotic statements like: "give me back my money." "I will call the police."

And I was like... what the actual fuck is going on? What the hell is she on about.  It was so bad that she even got one retarded lawyer and wanted to file a case.

For what? That you gave me money to PR your project. We haven't done the project. We were working towards doing the project. I was very upfront with the expectations of the project. She wanted to think big. I was weary of that thought, so I trimmed down her expectations. Best to think small and then do big things, than take her through big plans and later fail to deliver.

That was probably my offence.

And the harassment continued. It was for one reason I was sad... and that was because she was aware of my pain at that point in my life; I had shared it (because Mentor). When she now manifested into some kind of demon, I realised (like an abusive marriage), she believed she held a superior position and required my subservience. I have never truly cared for anyone's opinion of me like I did hers. It was my deliberate decision to make her my mentor (after, of course a few kind things she said and did). After a while, it was my vulnerability that was being used to mock me, keep me buried under her opinions. I was making apologies and explanations and I didn't understand why. I hadn't done anything wrong. 

Kai. Never again sha. I will die than use my dignity to mop someone else's damp brain.

She even placed calls to rebuke my rants. And when she finally decided to unfriend me hundred years ago, it was after calling to say that one particular rant was about her.

This is a more established woman calling to give opinions about my rants. I met with some of her friends who thought I didn't possess the same fire in reality like I did online. Which is quite idiotic. I don't carry fire on my head. I am not some washed out angry woman with traces of emotional hardship. In reality, I am pretty calm and QUIET. I dont drink, I don't smoke, I don't party, and I have no gist to share for longer than 15 minutes.

They were probably disappointed. I don't know. And I didn't care much for their analysis. I wasn't going to start acting broken and tough just because I am in the presence of people. If you watch your Mafia movies well, you will know that all the talkative persons have no balls. Don't mess with the quiet person on a table.

But I deviate.

So... that relationship died and mentorship ended to my great relief. 

It was after that I resolved that I will figure out this life on my own. If I win, I win. If I fail, I fail.

I made virtual mentors instead. Reading their stories and following their progress.

It is why I do not mentor anyone. The tendency to become an emotional bully is not too far from many Nigerians. If you share your vulnerability, you become a target. It is a Nigerian thing. To have people at your mercy. It is how the "Nigerian humility" works - to rid you of your authetic voice; in its place - a whisper.

I once had a problem with many schools not having Counsellors and counselling units for children. But then I changed my mind. I don't want any counsellor advising my girls. I don't think Nigerians are emotionally mature and selfless or even intelligent to understand boundaries. If it doesn't turn out as an extension of CRK/IRK, it would be another unit for emotional blackmail and even abuse.
