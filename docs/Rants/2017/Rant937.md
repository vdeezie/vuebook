This generation is, by far, the worst in the history of narcissistic generations of Nigeria... of pseudo-intelligence and dizzying rate of apathy.

I'm not sure which generation I speak of. As long as you are young and breathing; that would be from, say, 15 to 45 year olds.

We have technology, we have social media, we have access to the happenings in France, America and Asia. When news breaks in Taiwan of a modern gadget to ease communication, when China makes another big leap in technology, when Dubai became a reality right before our eyes... we see it all happen. We know the possibilities of this world... of having a brain and grit. We know. What the older generation didn't know... what they didn't possess, we have it all just by a click of a finger- sometimes on a smartphone. 

My mother still doesn't know how to send text messages; some parents are still in awe of WhatsApp. Some have never seen a Facebook page. It's all a mystery to them, a miracle that they believe they are not entitled to. 

What they understand is culture, religion and a few beliefs that modern knowledge has debunked- that you are incomplete if you are not married, that your greatest value as a woman is a pot of oha soup cooked skillfully with firewood, that a man is valued only if he has sons.

We know these things are false and quite disgraceful. We have new understanding that they don't have. But somehow, we still blame them for the Nigeria of 2017. We have been blaming them since 1966.

At this minute, some young one is probably writing a smart post about how that generation failed us. It will gather a neat number of likes, and the writer will carry on into the day feeling accomplished.

The generation you constantly accuse is old and sickly. But YOU - look at you; with the energy of youth, and the advantage you have to be alive at a time when (wo)men are gods, you still can't make the right decisions for the next generation.

So our children will grow up and continue the blame game. Then we will become like our parents - making excuses, passing the buck of responsibilities to our children. 

It's a vicious cycle. An evil, wretched habit.

We are obsessed with the frills and thrills of technology. As one of the largest consumers in the world, with no desire to produce, and no shame to curb our excesses, we enjoy a world produced by other nations; we grumble when inventions fail us - (WhatsApp is down for one millisecond! Aargh!). We spend our time living off crumbs of a world that we only like to assume is designed to favour someone else - some other race, some other gender, some other citizen... as we chew on popcorn and gladly miss out on the opportunity to apply the facilities of a modern world to our ills.

It was young Nigerians who voted in Buhari. Young Nigerians are mocking Charlie Boy for asking questions, for protesting. Young Nigerians are contemplating the return of the military... or the presidency of an Atiku. 

Young Nigerians started the #FreeEvans hashtag. Young Nigerians are appointed as media-whatever to the president.

As the country turns to dust, we are slaying on social media - slay mamas and mouthy papas.

As our roads turn to gullies, we are cyber excited and/or repulsed about something as inconsequential as nudes.

As another election year draws nearer, this "generation" is divided against itself. Young Nigerians have justified years of political robbery. Young Nigerians are the ones recruited into political thuggery.

But let's blame our fathers. Let's roll out of bed, smart phone in hand, and a witty phrase stuck in our head that we cannot wait to unleash on twitter so we can get a few more followers.

Let's continue this endless irritating shit on Facebook... searching for subs and who they belong to while electricity remains a herculean task.

We are waiting for 75 year old men to fix our country. Men who probably can't sign on Instagram without the help of a grandchild. Men who can't use excelsheet for the simplest solution. 

When this young generation touches the hem of politics, even without provocation, it revels in corruption as quickly as possible... becoming one of the "fathers" it had condemned in cute little tweets for years.

A young generation with acute shamelessness, zero moral fibre, fed fat with the leftover of drudgery sponsored by greedy old men.

Keep waiting.
