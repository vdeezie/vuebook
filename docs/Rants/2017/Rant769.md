OK. Before we cross into a new year, let me say this:

My boyfriend was working too hard and eating out a lot. And I thought the least I could do, since he carries the relationship on his shoulders 99% of the time; I could use the miserable 1% left in my care to do something "special".

So I made a feast and took it to his town. Jollof rice, chicken, soup, stew... bowls and bowls of food that would leave him fed and fat for a while.

Prisca saw the bowls of food and wondered if it wasn't an overkill. It was. I wanted to show off.

I remember the shock on his face too when he saw the big bowls of food.

"Would we be having a mini party?" he asked. 

"No it's all yours," I answered. 

Because every time we spoke on the phone, it always seemed he was "trying to get food to eat". And one day when he sent me a picture of rice and stew he finally made... I knew it wouldn't be a bad idea to cook and take to him.

Beyond that, it is hard to match this man's love.

I imagine him sitting and wondering, "What can I do for Joy today? Aha! Build her an aeroplane!" And immediately calls the engineers. Something like that. He is very expressive with love; action is the language he speaks... and I love it!

So I wanted to show off too. Bowls and bowls and bowls of food. Yes.

When he dropped the food at his place and we took a ride around town, he was quiet for a while and seemed uncomfortable. I thought it was just fatigue... until he parked at a parking lot and said he wanted to talk.

"Joy, I really love you. But I am really confused about this feminism thing. You cooked for me. Isn't feminism somewhat against that?"

So here I was, with a man who has done everything to make me happy... yet is worried if my cooking was some kind of charade and against a movement I am passionate about. 

So we sat in the car for 45 minutes and talked about feminism. 

This is a well travelled man. One of the most hardworking men I know. Head screwed in with the proper nuts. Very clear about his goals and ambitions He has been to almost every city in the world. Built his wealth from scratch, has a good appetite for knowledge.

Yet even he wasn't so clear on this cooking issue and feminism.

There's a comment on Temidayo's wall that talks about the danger of women moving into the world to demand certain portfolio when we are yet to educate our loved ones and inform the people around us about gender equality. 

It is true. First, we need to inform the people around us. It is our duty.

I had mentioned how my Chairman... the best boss ever(!!!) had asked if, as a feminist, I was gay.

The kindest man I know, brilliant orator. Yet... that conversation happened. Because people believe there's gender equality and there is feminism... and feminism isn't just seeking equality, it is hoping to "overthrow" men. It is no different from misandry.

We are lucky to be here at a time like this. We may be part of a revolution. Or may be not. But we are part of something beautiful- the chance to teach and change social stereotypes and mindset.

Whatever we do, and before we step out to make demands... we have to educate our household, our friends, our children, our colleagues, and the men who love us dearly. 

Because when I hear that a feminist organisation has been operating for 30 years in this Nigeria... yet a simple gender equality bill appears like a death sentence to leaders, some of them women... it says alot about preparation.

Are we really prepared to launch out of our beds yet?

It might seem like a trifling issue, but do have that plantain-and-salt discussion with someone in your life and don't let up easily until they get it right.

Then we can take bolder steps. I think.

I don't know for sure.

Happy New Year.
