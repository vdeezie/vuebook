Can you imagine Serena apologising to the Black community for marrying an Armenian:

I am so sorry, my dearly beloved black people. I am so sorry for falling in love with Ohanian. I didn't know he was really white. I thought he was some kind of mixed race... you know, a bit of chocolate. Because when he tans, his butt looks darker and his chest is a shade lighter than Denzel's palms. I do not know how love works, this trick called love... I do not know why love took me away from my black brothers. I waited for a black brother, a constant black man, but it didn't happen. I prayed. I believe in culture and tradition. So this is shocking to me too. I promise to allow the curls on our children's hair grow into thick rich locs to signify my undying love and support for my blackness. Again, I apologise. Love is a stupid thing. 

Yours foolishly,

Serena.

It sounds ridiculous and laughable, but this is how many women live their lives in Nigeria...

Always sorry. Always regretful. Always apologising. Always looking for a group of cyber clones to gather around and give them a hug. Always playing the victim. Always unsure. Always waiting to be saved. Always quick to find a place in a crowded room. Always living half the life they've been giving. Always living with little. Always living a lie. 

You are sorry for your choices. Because your choices aren't typical. You are sorry for being different. Sorry for having big dreams. Sorry for stepping out of line. Sorry for thinking differently. Sorry for not fitting in. Sorry for being a square peg in a round hole. Sorry for holding unpopular opinions. 

You apologise for being smarter. For being creative. For being better. 

"Oh I am so sorry, I never meant to know better than you. My mind just keeps thinking for itself. I feel foolish. I am not better. I am just like you. Look at me, I am ordinary. What do I know. I am just a simple woman."

Stop that nonsense in 2017.

Stop that flatulent hypocritical bullshit. 

If you are different. Be Different. Period.

And enough of these bloody liars dating married men and making open apologies like a wretched dog.

If you have to date a married man. Then date a married man. Let us hear word abeg. 

Date a married man, then go build a bridge connecting Amuwo Odofin to Ajah. Or date a single man. Or date a blown up doll. Or date another woman.

I don't care. 

"Oh! He is a married man? Oh please forgive me. I will never do it again. Oh, madam I will never fuck your husband again. Please, again I am sorry. I didn't know he was married. I didn't see the ring. Don't be offended."

The religion that forbids you fucking a married man, forbids you also from fucking any man out of wedlock. But we choose our hypocrisies. So carry on.

Live your life. Make your mistakes without stripping to your knickers. It is not your duty to strip yourself of honour and dignity. Leave the attempts for others. Stop being so beggarly about life. There's just nothing cute about it.

"I am sorry for believing I can bag a third degree. It was too ambitious of me. I should be having children by now. I should be thinking of a baby belching breastmilk all over my back when I lift it up. I should be thinking of diapers and teletubbies. I am so sorry my ambitions are in the way of true happiness."

Just shut up.

This 2017, shut up and go live the life you want for yourself. 

We don't care.

Well, I don't care.

As long as you come correct... even the mistakes you make, so long as they are made with the confidence of your truth, will be respected by me, above cheap social deception and cultural fraud.

Live.

My sisters, LIVE.

Do not apologise for your age. Do not apologise for your rebellion. Do not apologise for your choices.

Live.

Welcome to 2017.

I leave you with one of my best moments of living.

Cheers!
