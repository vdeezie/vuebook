Crime and Investigation 

Man loves woman. Woman loves man.

They get married. 

The couple wants children desperately. Pitter-patter of tiny feet wouldn't be such a bad thing, innit?

They try hard at this. Finally wifey is pregnant. But she suffers a miscarriage. 

Baby crib cannot use itself. A baby needs to occupy the room and heart of this couple. 

So they try again.

Sadly, another miscarriage happens.

Husband is in the military and tries to balance serving the country and comforting his wife.

To give support to wifey, he decides to go for a vasectomy. This couple cannot deal with yet another heartbreak. No more attempts at getting pregnant. This "failure" isn't something they wish to keep trying. 

OK. 

So husband is now unable to get wifey or any other woman pregnant. 

Hmm.

This is a marriage without the futile attempts at childbearing. 

With baby expectations out of the way, husband and wifey agree to loving each other and paying attention to a future without children. 

(PS: White people make these decisions without necessarily blaming a devil, you know).

Good. Moving on.

Everything seems fine for a while. 

One night husband's military colleague/friend is invited for dinner. Nothing out of the ordinary, just laughs and smiles on the table. 

What husband doesn't know is the instant connection between wifey and friend. 

Hian. 

Wifey changes suddenly. She isn't exactly feeling this husband of hers anymore.

Husband keeps giving of himself anyway.

One day sha, husband takes a military work trip. He was away for months but kept in touch.

When he returns home one lovely evening...

Wifey is pregnant fa!

P.R.E.G.N.A.N.T.

"How? WE can't have children. WE did a vasectomy," he says.

"Errr...not WE," wifey says "YOU did a vasectomy."

"But I did it for us."

Wifey is adamant now. She wants to move on. She is in love with someone else. She wants a divorce... yada yaga yugu yigi.

Husband asks one question, "Who is it?"

When he looks into her eyes, the answer is there.

Enraged, he storms out of the house.

But he is back in 30 minutes...

With the severed head of his friend and colleague.

No, you didn't hear me well...

I said: WITH THE SEVERED HEAD OF HIS FRIEND!!!

*As in... not even Game of Thrones is this gruesome!

"That's the fucker that got you pregnant? My own friend?!" Husband screams.

He flings the head at wifey. 

Wifey is shocked. She passes out.

Husband is sent to prison. 

Moral of the story:

Don't lose any part of your body or take the body parts of others. Head or vas deferens.
