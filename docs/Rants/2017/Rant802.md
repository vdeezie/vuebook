Tuface planned a protest. A protest to ask government questions:

Why is the Nigerian state deteriorating?

But you see, our elders are not used to being questioned. Constituted authorities are offended when we ask questions.

We sat and words flew over our heads when we were children. Nobody asks a child, "what do you think?" regarding any matter. We will not become brave overnight.

Like all of us, Tuface has had enough. He wants to ask questions.

But Nigerians don't like anyone sticking out from a crowd. You are not better than us. Put your head back in and suffer with us.

Only God can help us, we say. Anyone who tries to play the saviour is being foolish and arrogant. God will humiliate him.

He was threatened by the people. Because government is not the ministers occupying public position, government is the people working under constituted power waiting for big/small chunks of corruption to come to them. Government is the people who benefit from everyday corruption in their offices. They do not want to rattle the system, it will expose their daiiy indolence and deceit.

And it is true that hoodlums, gathered and paid, can obstruct a good cause. The Police do not have enough knowledge on how to deal peacefully with protesting Nigerians. This is not America. We are third world. We are scum. Our situation is far removed from decency and common sense. People will die.

When we gather to protest in a country where the omphalos is corruption and the sustenance is nepotism... people will die. And they will turn around and blame Tuface. The blood of lost ones shall be on his head, they'd say.

There'll be no justice system to defend him or protect his family. 

That's our reality. 

I don't believe Tuface is free from the suffering of the people and is only "considering the poor", as people like to say. I believe Tuface is greatly affected by the decay of our country. He is not trying to be a messiah. He is trying to save his family; trying to ensure there's a country left for his children to inherit. 

We exaggerate the wealth of celebrities in a third world country. This is not Leonardo Dicaprio. Get your African Forbes to give accurate report of Tuface's wealth and estates. It is not as fabulous as you may think. 

The real tragedy is not that tuface called this off, it is ordinary Nigerians who mocked him and waited by the corner for him to fail, it is the starving numbers that were excited about his humiliation... those are the real disaster. 

He didn't fail. YOU failed. 

YOU are still poor, YOU are still in debt, still wretched, still without good roads and electricity.YOUR children still will not have potable water, the education they receive will still lack quality.

This protest was supposed to stand as the bravest thing we would have done. 

We have strengthened this administration with this withdrawal. We will not be able to recover quickly from this action.

We have shown that we are spineless talkatives.  

As much as I cannot stand people who repent too easily, and as much as I think Tuface should have held the protest regardless...

I think he has done his best regarding this situation with a people who do not want salvation. We have adjusted completely to a degenerate society.

We are back to our churches, back to our offices and grind, back to sleeping in the dark under unbearable dark/hot circumstances, back to paying exorbitant school fees, back to bribing the police, back to crazy PHCN bills...

Congratulations, Nigerians. This is the life you've always had. It is the life you truly deserve.
