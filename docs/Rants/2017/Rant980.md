I picked up the girls for midterm break today.

Oh my goodness!

The glow on Jolade's face!

The glow on Jolade's face!!

The glow on Jolade's face!!

...and the pimple on Ife's cheek 😂😂😂

"Mummy, I'm happy!" Jolade said. 

She has two good friends already.

Ife says she'll keep only acquaintances for now. LOL! She's like me, and that's OK. 

I haven't seen that glow on Jolade since she was five!

They are home now, playing with their ipads, watching TV, chewing potato chips and sharing boarding school tales.

Whew!

If I could describe my life using a book title right now, it'd either be...

Sefi Attah's Everything Good Will Come

Or Onyeka Nwelue's The Beginning of Everything Colourful. 

A movie title? Serendipity, most definitely.

Bless! ❤❤❤
