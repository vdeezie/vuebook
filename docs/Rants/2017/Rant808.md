You are dispensable. 

We are all dispensable. 

A little truth never hurt. 

I know your pastor tells you every Sunday that you are so precious; God took his time and counted the hair on your head...

Yet, we see dead human beings on the streets hit by a car, left to rot like mere rats... without the decency of a kind death.

And life goes on.

The job you left that you swore you were the oxygen in the office. Guess what? They moved on without you; like you were never there. Got someone with the colour of your eyes and even teased one another about the resemblance. 

But they never lost sleep over you. You are gone. You are so fucking dispensable.

The spouse you told would be nothing without you. Damn. Have you seen him/her lately? S/he is more beautiful, more successful, very fulfilled without you.

-Because you are dispensable.

The friend you argued will be left out of - what? - "friendshipness", is very happy you left. Phew!

People recover from losing loved ones. We pick ourselves up and move on after heartbreak. Shit, we even look better after a few months.

Presidents die and countries continue to thrive. Popes resign and faith still stands. 

When it is over for you, know that you will be missed. But not for too long.

You are human. You were made to be dispensable. 

Try it: walk out of your relationship this minute. Watch the tears of your partner roll down the cheek. If they are worth more than a pack of noodles, you'll find them the next few weeks/months picking the pieces of their life, getting set to make better success of what you left behind.

Because you are dispensable. 

The world will stay round. Birds will fly. The sun will usher in the day, the moon will undress the night...

Nothing really changes when you make temporary or permanent decisions. Except you. Your choices affect you. Makes you richer or poorer. Better or worse. Happier or pathetic.

The rest of humanity will carry on like nothing happened.

You are replaceable.

As a matter of fact, many people are so easily replaceable. Whether God counted the hair on your head as a sign of your uniqueness or not... on this flippant earth, you are dispensable.  

So pursue the things you want in your life. Grab a hold of them. Be loyal to them. Don't be afraid to forgive. Don't be afraid to ask for a second chance. 

Don't be afraid to move on.

Just be sure you are doing life with the right people. 

The disposable nature of your being makes it critical to live genuinely. Holding on to what you want, and letting go of what you don't. 

You are dispensable. 

I remember a boss told me once, "I don't want to lose you." But she did. And she carried on with life and made even bigger badder successes.

Because, dispensable.

I am too aware of the people and things that matter to me. If I am not loyal, it will hurt them... BUT they will move on. So my duty is to keep and nurture them, and discard everyone and everything else to preserve that which is mine. Because if I mess it up and they hurt or leave, I am aware that they will be fine eventually. I keep what is mine. And what is mine keeps me.

By all means claim to be the greatest; when you die someone greater will happen to the world. A better architect. A more brilliant writer. A smarter lawyer. A greater companion. 

Dispensable me. Replaceable you.

Even life teaches you to recognise your transience.

Things may change for a minute. It may get tougher or better. But ultimately, life continues.

So be kind to yourself. Make smarter choices.

Your humility should rest on the fact that your absence changes almost nothing.

PS: This does not in anyway make transient the exceptional roles of people like Mandela, Malcolm X, and great leaders.

Bhet, let's be frank, that's not you. So stick to the script.
