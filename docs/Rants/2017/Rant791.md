I got another anonymous donation of N20,000 for The Nigerian Revolution. 

Thank you

We have N97,000.

N153,000 to go!

In other news, parents of Nigeria-Turkish International school are raising funds for ransom for kidnappers of their children.

They have raised N7.25 million.

They got in touch with the kidnappers, but the criminals said the money was "too small". They asked them to "go and add more to the money", if they wanted their kids to be released.

The kidnappers had earlier demanded N100 million for each of the students, and N300 million each for the Turkish nationals.

In a country where there are security agents, this is what happens to us. This has become our daily stories and tales.

Yet we are all quiet. Protecting our own home. Slowly these things will come to us if we do not act:

1. Demand The Police to do their job.
2. Get government to empower The Police.
3. Demand for protection of the citizens of this country. 
4. Ensure that these kidnappers rot in jail.

If these bastards get away with this crime... if they get the ransom they want...just know that we are all finished! Our lives are officially over.

We would have signed a pact with kidnappers to go into any school to grab students.

If you think your children's school is "not so expensive" to attract kidnappers, you lie! The one million naira kidnappers and the N200k kidnappers will grab them, rape them and demand for paltry sums. Then push their bodies back to you. 

What are you going to do about it? 

The fact that a N7.25million has been gathered and parents are BEGGING kidnappers to accept it is enough to get people out on the streets to ask questions.

This is not a country!

This is not normal. Parents getting ransom to settle kidnappers is not normal! It is not acceptable.

This virus will spread. If these men get away with this... it will spread.

Do something.

For godsake, Nigerians! Stand up and do something!

Don't sit at home and pray it doesn't get to you. It will get to you. Do you see how fulani herdsmen have raped and killed the North and have crept into the East? It is a virus.

These things will come to us and no prayer can save you. 

What are we going to do when kidnappers demand and reject ransoms. We empower these people with or silence. We do not demand justice.

We are more in numbers than those who hold us back. But we are quiet. Our numbers mean nothing because we are cowards.

Our silence will kill us.

Our silence will kill us. 

We are fighting little silly personal wars... save your bitterness and your energy for the real issues.

Fight for your dignity and your right to peace.

We will have this revolution. If it is the last thing I do.
