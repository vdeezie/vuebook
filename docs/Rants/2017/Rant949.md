Years ago, I was spending time with this guy. We were in some kind of relationship. Nothing was said, but a lot was communicated.

You know that kind of situationship - you are getting to know each other, you aren't making any commitments, but you are spending time together and calling every other hour. 

It was what I needed then. The feel of something that was exclusive, but not exclusive enough to intrude in my dark spaces.

Yet I believed, since we spent that much time together, there couldn't possibly be room for any extras.

Wrong. 

The most hilarious thing happened...

So I was handling this client's Facebook account. A celebrity. And celebrities always get trolls sending "hello baby" inbox messages, praising their "endless beauty", and cooing over their stardom.

And here I was, doing my job... separating the wheat from the chaff from my client's inbox messages, when I stumbled on a message from the Bros I was supposed to be in a situationship with. 

He was a troll.

Jesu!!! 

In the midst of all the raggedy trolls of social media, was someone I knew.

Kai!

Igbo boy trolling celeb.

I wanted to respond to the message, pretend I was the celeb, keep up with the chat. But that would be very unprofessional.

So this was how I brought the matter up with him:

"Hey."

"Hey."

"So, you know... I told you I am a celebrity publicist and I handle quite a number of accounts..."

"Yea. You mentioned that."

"I always ask my clients if it is OK to weed their DM/inbox messages..."

"OK?"

"Some of them don't have a problem with that, others do; if they do, I stay away from their inbox."

"OK?"

"So this lady - XYZ, is a client..."

"OK?"

"And she doesn't have a problem with me taking care of trolls sending her inbox messages. Technically, I run the account "

*Everlasting silence*

"Hello, are you there?"

"Yea."

"I just read your messages to her. Do you know her?"

"Nope."

"OK. Just wanted you to know I handle her social media accounts. Celebrities don't like trolls."

"I wasn't trolling."

"Oh you weren't? Writing 'You are a pretty' three times in one day to a celebrity who doesn't know your ass is called trolling."

"Yea. Whatever"

We never spoke after that.
