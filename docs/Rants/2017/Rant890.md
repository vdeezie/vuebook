It was two years ago. We were at Shoprite getting some chicken thighs.

A woman tapped me gently on my shoulder and whispered in my ears…

“You may need to get your daughter a brassiere. The bra top seems unsuitable for this level of her maturing. She’s acting self-conscious.”

I did a sharp turn. I wanted to see for myself if the bra top was, indeed, unsuitable. But the woman held my shoulder and said, “No. You will startle her.”

Wow.

“I have been here before with my own daughter.  You are so close to them, you miss certain details of pubescence. You may also probably be unsure how to act when confronted by it.” Not exactly in those words, but it was what she meant. 

I said my “thank yous” many times. She smiled. What a woman!

I was angry I didn’t realize this on my own. And I was anxious to do something about it.

So I dropped the chicken thighs. Dragged her out of Shoprite, and we went shopping for bras almost immediately.

I wanted to #pepperdem… well, pepper me, actually; so I bought her 10 bras from the store I buy my own bras.

You didn’t hear me oh! I said: 10. bras. from. the. store. I. buy. my. own. bras.

It still is the most expensive lingerie shopping I’ve ever done in one day.

Why did I buy designer bras for her? I think I wanted to punish myself.

And I did as the debit alert sang a familiar tune in my ear… I took the pain like a real woman. LOL!

It was #pepperdem directed at maternal inattention.
