How my day went…

I was writing a script till 3am this morning. Then I slept for 3 hours.

I woke up by 6am, back to writing. Hunger stepped in by 8am. I found rice and chicken in my fridge, I ate and left for a meeting by 12pm.

Client delayed. Sigh!

Where to go? I tried to book another meeting at short notice, no such luck.

So I drove to The Palms. Found a parking space, made a pillow of a cloth lying in my car, switched the a/c to the highest, and I slept for two hours! I’m sure my mouth was wide open because my head position was awkward. LOL!

I had so much writing to do but sleep is a jealous lover. It had to take back those hours it lost. 

Waking up, I write an entire episode of a series in my head. Yes, episode 4 is written. All I need to do is move it from my head to my laptop when i get home.

Time is indeed the only currency we have.

Client finally gets into the Island. We had a 4 hour meeting. Paper signed. The sheer volume of work will keep me busy till 2019.

When I think of all that work, and hundreds of pages to write - creating characters, developing dialogue, establishing love, pain or joy; deciding who lives or dies; playing god… 

I get so fucking excited!

No rest for this wicked woman.

Bless.
