You must understand that e-feminists aren't exactly very bright. You need to extricate yourself from that charade before you become a mumbling moron, talking from both sides of a stuffed mouth.

The women, especially. And then there are the men who just want to get laid under feminism. LMAO! I mean, these people are clowns.

Some men do take the time to understand a few basic things. For the Nigerian woman, however, all she needs is a N70k job and a heartbreak. Throw in a tokunbo car and the knack to despise laundry, that’s your starter pack for Naija e-feminism. 

A few “No, I can’t date you” in their vocabulary; then they are well on their way to becoming slay queens of feminism.

These people are dumb. The fact that you pay attention to the shit that drops from their anus is hilarious.

You really expect anything sensible to happen in the midst of uninformed feminists, walking around cyber space, chanting badass and giving us rules on how to treat the men in our lives?

You really live for this people’s shit? We should be laughing at these people, not taking their mess seriously.

If at all you need education on feminism, dig through relevant literature online. Buy books. READ, damn it. Don’t be an idiot for religion and a fool for feminism. There’s only so much common sense you should trade in one lifetime.

The only revolution required is y’all getting some education to shame your loud ignorance.
