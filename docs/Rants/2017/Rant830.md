I wasn't going to talk about this... but what the heck!

It so happened that I was hanging out with two feminists two weeks ago (trust me, it wasn't deliberate. The outing stumbled and fell on me).

One of them is dating a married man. They are having issues. She puts the issue on the table. 

I sincerely don't care. I'm paying for my own food and I have no friendship or familial responsibility towards either of them. She gets a miserly 15% of my attention. Because courtesy demands that I nod and smile at every necessary juncture of her tale. It's the least I can give to her grief.

But then something happened. During random conversation I asked the other lady about a mutual acquaintance - a married man. Maybe I asked too many questions, because the next thing she said was...

"Wait! I hope you don't think I dated him?" 

"I really don't care. That's not why I'm asking about him. My office is looking for property and I know he is a realtor," I said.

"Well, it is important that you know I never dated him. I don't date married men. I am not stupid."

You see, this is where I ALWAYS have a problem with women. This pretend shit they call friendship which comes with idiotic hashtags like: #GirlPower #WomenSupportWomen etc.

This neanderthal is sitting across her friend who is grieving over her married boyfriend, and she thinks the smart thing to do at that hangout is to build a wall segregating her friend's "poor taste" from her own refined and/or exquisite disposition.

The other fool was still seated smiling like a goat, downing her shot of alcohol. 

I am not a moral police. I still believe Nigeria runs a polygamous system. Polygamy is not our major concern as a nation. Polygamy has helped many poor women. I don't have a problem with it. 

One out of three babyboomers are polygamists.  Your father is probably one.

So what the fuck are we talking about here??? If we are talking deceit, then let's stick to deceit.

Polygamy, if by choice, shouldn't be your concern. Some cultures admit polyandry. Your Obas from Itsekiri to Ile Ife have polygamous homes.

Hallo!!!

I hear feminists talk about loving only older men, dating only men who make N350k and above, men who can cook, men who know how to open doors, men who understand their rights (to be assholes), men who can balance strength, weakness, chivalry and dominance. 

Phew! Are you reversing roles or seeking equality?

Dear Nigerian Feminists, you are not only bad friends finding pleasure in the anguish of one another...

You are ageists. You are delusional. 

I sat through that sour hangout wondering if that woman fell off a tree and got hit by a truck. 

She's ugly. And I'm not talking inner beauty here. She's ugly as fuck.

Feminism will not hide your insecurities. 

And making another woman's preference a tool for mockery will not make you great.

I am nobody's favourite because there's no way I'm going to sit through any hangout with a bunch of women who'd have any nasty opinion about my choices. I dare you to confront me with your biases to my face (forget keypad and online braggadocio)... that day you go know how far.

PS: the other one called me to thank me for standing up for her. But I wasn't trying to be her friend. I only had to confront a hypocrite. We can never be friends.
