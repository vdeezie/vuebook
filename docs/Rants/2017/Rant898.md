July 3, 2017

On my way to work, the rains beating down on the earth, flood, gullies and chaos… The Nigerian Police in their raincoats were stopping vehicles. Not assisting motorists to ease traffic, no. Cars of interest were redirected, waylaid, and the conversation we all know too well ensued.

I sighed. Truly depressed. 

Then it occurred to me that I may die never experiencing good governance my entire life.

I will never know what it feels like to call the police during a burglary, get the house surrounded in minutes, and the profile of the thief circulated all across the city.

I may never see a corrupt leader pay for years of ruining the country I call home.

I may never experience 24/hour electricity for an entire year.

Government may never provide me drinkable water.

It happened in just a minute, these thoughts, as I watched The Police take advantage of under-development and bad governance. It is raining for petesake; the roads are bad… why do you need to stand at the very spot of our collective pain to extort us?

I wasn’t stopped but I did cry.

I don’t understand how this country makes sense to anyone.
