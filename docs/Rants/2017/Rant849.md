Dear Millenial, 

You have your whole life ahead of you...

STOP INHERITING PEOPLE'S ENEMIES.

If they didn't do it to you, then it should be none of your business. Face your future. 

Someday, you'll inherit an enemy you have no business inheriting; standing between you and your next pay cheque or opportunity.

Stop being an idiot about life.

Do not get involved with subs that you have no business in. Stop burning your bridges, stop building your walls. 

You are 23... yes, 26.

You've got more beef in your life than ambition or money in your account. 

A sub post with 200 likes and 87 comments gives you more joy than writing a 1000 word document that will earn you some money. 

You are failing your way into your future. 

This is the time to make that money or focus on that ambition that will build your mansion and grow your career in future. 

Laugh if you want. Mediocrity is one size fits all. 

One lousy comment, or silly new word you need to flaunt to register how stupid you are buying up foes, one idiotic post... and poverty will come at you like a thousand mosquitoes at night.

Leave these old folks to continue in their foolery. They are stupid anyway, and their lives are wasted.

But YOU, think of protecting, preserving and building relationships instead. 

I didn't say ass-lick. I said build healthy relationships. 

The biggest failures are those who just cannot wait to buy off a new foe at an auction market traded by someone else. Use your talent for something else.

Stand up for what is right, of course. Defend a voice intelligently. But don't go un-friending anyone based on half-truths and/or false account.

You shouldn't be that stupid. Bragging your way to penury.

You need as many people to open doors for you. Even if it's a back door. It still leads you into the banquet.

Sometimes you can't get in because of ONE lousy comment or post you had no business getting involved in.

Stop being a fool. There's no reward here on Facebook. The real living happens out of your cyber fly suave presence. In reality, you can't even pay your bills.

What is wrong with you!

And stop listening to people who try to play down money. They are wrong for you.

Your financial health is one of the most important parts of your life. People will praise or mock you based on your lack of ready cash... just as you praise or mock people based on anything you believe you have that they lack.

Be a little smarter than the ant. You may have no mentors to guide you, guide yourself. Gather your goodwill, store up you loyalties for "winter" - when you'll need a little favour, a new job, a new life, some advice, a loan.

Your constant whip-smart shit on social media can only take you as far as it has. Now you're just moving round in circles with the same comments...

#Gbam. "THIS!". "You nailed it". "Correct". "You said it all".

A Russian roulette. Soon you'll shoot yourself in the head. For years of playing small.

You can't build anything on shitty subs.

Be wiser. Or may be not.

Whatever. 

Takes nothing away from my next meal.

Good day.
