When we are busy talking about nepotism at the top, let us remember how we play ourselves at the bottom...

I am house-hunting. Agent finds a place. Everything looks good. I'm not comfortable with that part of the area, but hey... I mind my business so I'm sure everything should be fine.

So I follow my agent to the office to meet with the other agent who introduced the main agent to my agent so I can fill a form of interest to rent the apartment *Phew!*

We get there. The office is a small box with fire lit underneath it. That's the best description I can give to that hell hole. In this small hot box is a woman sweating from her armpit, and a man sweating from his bald.

The agent who came with my agent to introduce us to the main agent (again, phew!)... started some kind of religious conversation to break the heat (definitely not ice). They brag for a minute about their denominations, and being prayer warriors, stuff of that nature. One of the agent (not mine) has a religious tag to his name (reverend, deacon... I can't recall).

Now the woman in the hot office is comfortable with us, seeing as we are... err... brethren. 

"She is interested in renting the apartment," reverend agent said. The Reverend was the only one she paid any attention to seeing as he was of a bigger calling than any of us. 

She pulled out a sheet of paper and demanded N2,000. Just to fill a form fa!

"Why are we paying for a sheet of paper," my agent asked.

Immediately she withdrew the paper and ignored us, forming busy, acting like we were intruding and corrupting her space. The way rich white women in Beverly Hills mansions would react to mice.

She was offended that we would ask any question regarding the process and back-door payments. 

It may be just N2k... but for petesake, are we expected to just pay without understanding why we are paying?

The Reverend starts to apologise to her. Hian! 

"People don't ask all this questions nah!" She squeezed her face and slapped the mop on her head.

I was pissed. My agent was irritated.

"Are you saying we don't have a right to know why we should pay for a sheet of paper?"

"I don't want wahala abeg! That is the process," I imagined smoke coming out of her nose.

"Do we get a refund if you eventually don't give us the house?" I asked. 

"You will get it," Reverend prayed.

"Are you married?" She finally looked my way.

Silence.

"Yes." *gulp*

"Where is he?"

"In the Carribeans."

I swear, I thought for a minute she'd catch the sarcasm. But she didn't.

"Any children? Where are they?"

"With me."

"Good. They will live with you, abi?"

I wanted to roll my eyes but I said "yes" and let it be.

I paid for the sheet of papepr. She said I can call her during the weekend for an update.

So I call on Saturday. I asked if the form has been processed. She said she'd get back to me.

Today, she calls my agent and says, "That woman was shouting on me on the phone demanding for her two thousand naira!"

Me?!!! Ah!!! How? When?

I was so angry, I called her and told her I was on my way to her office to watch her fold that mouth of hers and tell that lie to my face.

She was gone before I got there. Only her scrawny sweating-from-the-bald colleague was there.

He handed me my N2k.

End of transaction. 

It could be that she hated the fact that we questioned her authority. Or that we didn't join in the religious conversation or seemed to care about their little banter away from the subject.

It could be that she would prefer a "godly woman" with a husband present in Nigeria to tame her.

It could be that she just hates the way I look. Or I remind her of someone who "stole" the man she loved when she was still a "chick".

It could be my aura. It could be that I am different and she hates women who are different.

It could be that my shoulders offended her and she wished for me to have a hunchback. 

So she used her small power to deny me something I wanted. And she still denied me a little poking of my hand into her ugly lies.

Bottom line is I lost the house. If it's any consolation, I hated the location.
