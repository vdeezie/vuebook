Arrogant mummy post 

I make an instruction to MY children, yet we have Nigerians trying to tell me how to re-instruct them.

This community living gets my goat. I don‚Äôt need your advice. I don‚Äôt care for it. And as I am certain, I don‚Äôt appreciate whatever standards you live by or run your family by. You are most likely average or beneath average. You have nothing to share with a woman who wishes for her kids to walk on water.

I don‚Äôt know you people.

I have seen a lot of you as you live your lives in your N500 bra, whilst rebuking other women not to spend N1,000 extra on a brassiere. And you have something to say to me? Look at the rubbish money we are talking about regarding the item that holds your breasts together. These are the women that constantly have advice to throw around regarding marriage. Your Pearl baby oil and how you scoff at any skincare brand that exceeds N1,250, your amazing marriage and all the patience you pump into it, the tokunbo car he finally gets you after 5 years, your little job at that little desk, and how you need to birth all your children before 35 so they appear like progress chart in excel, except there‚Äôs no clear progress in your life. You, as average as fuck, have instructions you need to pass to children?

I say I don‚Äôt want this shitty average life and happiness for my children. But as Nigerians, you have to poke your nose through my door to advice me on how to train my children. You think to recruit the girl child in your pathetic ambitions just so the cycle continues after you.

My kids have read‚Ä¶ oh let me not bore you with my amazing mother facts. I am the mother your children wish they had! I am committed to their lives from the hair on their head to the shoes on their feet. You don‚Äôt have anything to tell me about raising brilliant girls.

They are presently reading Bedtime Stories for Rebel Girls. They don‚Äôt go to church. They play chess. They read every day. I tell them to have a personal relationship with God; whatever they conceive Him to be.

We sit down for one hour every other day and argue about stuff I show them on the internet. They ask critical questions ‚Äì about the church across the street screaming from morning till night, about police officers who ask for bribe, about teachers who beg, about neighbours who are poor. They ask questions and we have lengthy discussions about life. We google, we banter.

You do not have anything to tell my children. They will not think much of you when you start to blab about submission and washing plates.

I don‚Äôt care for your opinions.

Raise your children for marriage. Tell them it is a great thing. Tell them having children is the most amazing feeling in the world, and being in a man‚Äôs house requires patience and the Holy Spirit. That‚Äôs your business.

Let me choose to raise my children differently.

I don‚Äôt believe there is any true balance in life. We don‚Äôt seek balance, we seek Happiness and Fulfillment. Balance is a myth. And please don‚Äôt tell me about your mother, and how she is happy. She is NOT happy. You know it deep down, especially when you start that shit story about ‚Äúlong-suffering‚Äù. Don‚Äôt tell me about you either in your little two-bedroom marriage. I am not inspired by that. That's not balance, that's you living within your means (which is good, of course). The ponmo in your stew, the soapy water after washing oga's clothes that you leave overnight so you can wash the toilet the next morning...because Harpic is a luxury your love life can do without. Sweating in your husband's zero a/c motor... waiting for the day you will upgrade so you can tell other women how to persevere.

I think you are all very stupid. I think so little of you. Is this the reason God gave you breath?

Leave me to be arrogant. Leave me to raise two little rebellious girls. If the world is filled with submissive girls and only two rebellious ones, surely that world will be ok. Abi?

A lot of your marriage discussions make me sick to the pit of my stomach. I don‚Äôt want my kids sounding anything like you.

And when you talk about balance I just want to look for a stadium and faint. What balance?

The opportunity to be where you want to be without the common chains we all have on weighing you down. That is my idea of success ‚Äì free of the popular opinions and lifestyle of many. Balance is success.

This is what I will preach to my kids. It is left for them to take it or leave it. But this unpopular truth must be shared. If they grow up and choose to live like all of you, I will grieve, but I will be fine. Because I love them.

But my ultimate desire is that they stay very far from anything that any of you stand for. I find you utterly beneath anything amazing. This monkeys-and-a-ladder-with-bananas-at-the-top-but-showers-of-water-will-not-let-them-be-great is your curse, not mine.

For me and my household, this rebellious trio, we are free!

Grr! Be very angry üòÇüòÇüòÇ
