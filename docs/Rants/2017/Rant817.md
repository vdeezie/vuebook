..and there's the ugu seller who visits neighbouring fast food joints.

She wears red lipstick, pats her natural short hair nicely, makes an attempt to dress the part hoping she'd fit in.

It is the feet that tells the story of drudgery and travail.

Every story starts from the feet. 

The first time I saw her at TFC, I was rushing in to get my mum some snacks. I know her as the woman in the market who sells ugu. So I thought maybe she was sent on an errand by a customer. 

The next time I met her at Mr. Biggs. She had the red lips on, ordered a bottle of coke... and sincerely, without exaggeration on my part, pretended she was some kind of Marilyn Monroe.

She was flipping invisible long hair, batting her eyes seductively to no one, smiling coyly and sipping from that bottle ever so calmly.

I thought it was incredible. Why should she be stuck to selling ugu, when she could come around a fast food joint and have a cold bottle of coke and imagine a life where she was someone else.

I would meet her again at KFC, Chicken Republic etc...

Legs crossed, lips rouged, sipping on a bottle of coke. Sometimes she had one meatpie in her plate, like a companion she was about to engage in conversation. She sat and ate slowly, smiling, watching Trace TV, breathing in cool air.

At some point it was some kind of magic for me to bump into her. She never looked my way. She would approach the counter with highfalutin accent; order her drink and walk gingerly to a table where she'd be seated for long minutes, smiling to Justin Timberlake or Wizkid on TV.

Her peers may laugh at her and wonder what's up with all the odd trips to joints above her league.

I think, as long as she can afford her bottle of coke and snack wherever she decides to go, and she can be Marilyn Monroe... then heck, nowhere is above her league.

PS: It may be some kind of mental issue, but who wouldn't want a mental escape from the constant bellowing chaos of selling ugu in the open market. 

Let a woman dream abeg.

This could easily be me in Manhattan.

A woman is entitled to her happiness.
