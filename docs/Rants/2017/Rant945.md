I place men on a higher pedestal. I will pass this on to my children. Expect a certain behaviour from men. Anything less than that is not acceptable. 

A man should not be rowdy, lousy, uncouth or stupid. 

"My name is Electronic Money..."

He should not go by a name so incredible idiotic.

And he shouldn't be caught on Facebook LIVE with a friend recording the activities he had with an Ex.

You are a man. That means, as the world is structured presently, you are privileged. You cannot be shamed and your gender loses very little when things go wrong especially in a relationship.

Ask that Akwa Ibom randy fool if his wife isn't giving him her honeypot from the back after seducing and sleeping with - how many girls again? - 13 girls on Facebook. 

Men, your emotional/sexual crimes come with no justice. What the hell do you need to be so petty for?

You. Are. A. Man.

Act like one!

So a girl is ranting about how you treated her. Soooooo???

If you want to marry another woman in 5 days, you can! Those are privileges of Patriarchy. Nothing that tries to shame a man really sticks.

I can't stand it when men act like little girls. Look at them all over Facebook... they are top gossip-mongers, smacking their lips for the next drama, girl-cliquing with housewives, subbing women... 

"There's a woman on my timeline who think she is -"

Shut up! You lousy man!

A man should work. A man should be calm, organised, patient, intelligent.

The world is yours already... so what the fuck?

If you are poor, you will find a woman. They'll line up to fight for you sef. Sleep with you and give you money to feed. Patriarchy has taught women to honour every type of man. From the laziest slob to the wealthiest gentleman... men find what they want.

It is why they tell women not to be "too picky", "bring your shoulders down", "grow with him", "drop your standards lower". -Because every man must fit into your wish list.

So men, what's your fuss?

Let women cry, shout, scream, let them record heartbreak stories... YOU, man, smile and walk away. 

Whether you are a bricklayer or a financial consultant, you are above the theatrics of any woman.

The universe has made you king.

You are judged by very little or nothing at all. 

Whew!

Women, it doesn't matter whether you be married or not, one of your goals should always be: Dating a man humbled by his own privileges.

Selah.
