I just read a munched chat on Olutoyosi Omotoso's wall.

Some dude asking for airtime for over a century... Olutoyosi allows his request grow into a full blown shame of constant harassment.

"Buy me airtime so I can upload videos online."

Is that an ambition??? I'm sure he is a #BBNaija fan. Lol!

My cyber experience with boys is... "don't respond to scum."

Their desperate need to get your attention is hilarious. 

Have you had a boy on social media seek you out? Damn! He can't sleep, can't eat, can't concentrate. He is calling you out on every flimsy post, every other week, hoping and praying you will pay him some attention. 

It's not working, you still think of him like you would think of the rat that jumped over a broom. This infuriates him. Next, your picture is on his wall. Oh lord when will she respond, this damsel called Joy.

Aww, no response. Sorry.

A long ass badly written poorly edited letter follows, you skip this shit... because really the value of this boy is less than a cent. Are you really going to engage someone who can't even buy his own bread to eat?

Then countless daft posts that mean absolutely nothing.

After a while it becomes not just sad, there are traces of deep mental problems and suicidal depression. Yet you care so very much for your laundry, you can't even spare an ounce of emotion on this sad fellow.

They will finally find your very good friend's wall to try out a few new words, fix them into incoherent sentences, hoping to both annoy and impress you.

You still think a rat is worth more attention.

Boys do everything to get your attention. Sub you until there's no blood left in them.

Your job is to make sure you never give them that attention.

Let them burn.

It will kill them over and over again. Drain them of peace. Sleepless night, wanking over the thought of you saying, "Hello".

Make sure that never happens.

At some point, I had to un-friend 99% of the lot so I can let 28 to 45 year old women entrepreneurs into my cyberspace.

These women are buyers of lifestyle goods and services. I produce and create a lifestyle brand. They patronise me. 

Women bought 50+ tickets for my Play in December. Over 30 women have booked to watch my British Council Play, Wedding Blues.

If I start a business today, women will be my biggest and more loyal customers. If I launch a Breakfast Show on TV, they will watch. My radio show, they are the consumers. 

I will be speaking to 100 Konga women in March. It is a top woman executive who reached out to me.

British Council, it was a woman who inspired and encouraged me as my Play hits stage.

When one woman tore her pubic hair out claiming I insulted her child... it was a woman who sent this message:
"I don't know what she is talking about but as long as her name is not on that post then she is a lousy evil troublemaking hypocrite. And she deserved the subtle warning. You can't crave pity when all you give is a tone of war towards a particular person. You had been warning her for a long time to stop the subs, hadn't you? But she thought she could use the numbers from that sick group to cower you. The agressor and the victim all rolled in one. What a witch! How convenient for her to be another Joy hater. How convenient. This people are so unoriginal. Let her burn abeg."

I can't lie, I laughed my heart out at that comment and I healed.

Later the woman sent me a bottle of wine.

My point is, when it comes to women, I will fight and I will love. I will give the attention I want to give if I think you are amazing or an idiot.

But boys? Never. You go write tire. 

At a festival last year, I hadn't even dropped my bags in my hotel room, was trying to get familiar with the programme when a boy asked me for money. Said he was stranded.

Because this happens too often, I know how it always plays out...

If you don't give that money, you become an enemy. The next minute, he is subbing you on social media, TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

If you don't respond to their job application email, you become an enemy.

If you don't respond to the article they send to you, or the lousy attempt to chat with you via inbox... if they cannot have the opportunity to be in the numbers that you care about... they hate.

Many have no real jobs, no regular income. Yet a lot of noise and desperate attention hooks.

Phew. Give yourself a break.
