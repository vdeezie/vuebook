Hanging out with Coldstone dude last weekend, after lunch and after hours of getting-to-know-eachother, silence fell on us (as should be expected). I noticed he was uncomfortable (with silence). I hoped he wouldn't be, I really hate people talking too much (not that he talked too much, but we were getting there because he was afraid of silence).

After 5 minutes of (un)comfortable silence, I realised he was thinking hard on what to say. I prayed silently he wouldn't find a single thing to talk about.

He eventually said something: 

"You are so intelligent, I feel like being silent around you makes me dumb."

Oh wow. Imagine that! 

Here I was hoping we could bask in a moment of silence so we can process all the talk we had shared for three hours; soak in the hour and later find random things to think about... and there he was thinking silence was a sign of incompatibility. 

Whew!

There was a woman I was hoping I could build friendship with. She is smart, unpretentious and low maintenance. But whenever I remember how much talk happened between us in 5 hours of meeting for the first time, I get too exhausted to even pick her calls. And as much as I want to hang out and get to know her (as I think she is a wonderful person), I am weary of friendship that accommodates too much talk. She spoke nonstop, I thought I would die. I got home, shut the door and left all the talk homeless on the street.

That's the thing about chatty friendships - you don't remember half the shit you share. I washed off all the talk and reprogrammed my brain.

I met her only once. Promised to build the friendship we agreed to start... 5 months down the line, I am yet to return her missed calls.

I am afraid. I am exhausted. I don't like people who talk. 

Silence is special in friendship.

I still want that girlfriend who will hangout every Friday night and/or Saturday morning at a coffee shop with little or no word exchanged.

Someone who knows that silence is the strongest bond two people can share. 

A smart person who cherishes silence is a thing of worship. 

So anyways, I made Coldstone dude realise the only way we can keep a friendship is if we appreciate the sound of silence between us.

He gets it now.

Silence, please.
