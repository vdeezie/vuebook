Title: Stay Stupid.

We may complain... but sincerely, we do not want everybody to be smart. Or above petty.

Contrary to what they say, the cheese is not large enough. The sky is not big enough. This is Nigeria. Nothing is big enough.

If you miss the agbado at Iya Risikatu's junction, the next agbado junction will take three bus rides, one okada accident and a 15-minutes walk. No time.

If Olaoluwa Abagun did not make it to #CSW this year... if she was busy trolling on social media, someone else will get her spot.

Every young person wanted Mary Ajayi's spot last year.

Every young person didn't get it. Mary did.

And as far as you live in Nigeria, there are no alternatives to missing #CSW.

You seem to forget you are a third-world problem in the eyes of first worlds. They need to take care of your dying children. They need to monitor your disgraceful level of corruption. They need to help you find water to drink. Confront your government on the level of child mortality rate. Send a few of you Visas to come learn in their well-furnished schools... away from embarrassing lack of everything in your citadels of learning.

Your sky is not big enough.

If your father is poor or broke or irresponsible, your neighbour's open door for dinner will come with strict conditions.

That sky is not big. That sky is borrowed.

The opportunities are few.

It is only one writer that is called to represent Nigeria at an international festival. Maybe two. Definitely not one hundred.

The international community have to break that bread to get to one individual in each African nation.

One Nigerian business gets sponsored by an international investment company. Just one. Maybe two.

This is a queue.

170 million people on a queue, waiting for opportunities. 

Jumping the queue is allowed. Skip all the stupid people/cliques bantering away commonsense, hop all the way to the front.

Apply for a program in Germany. Enrol for business support in Seattle. Apply for grant in Scotland. Be the one to start a million dollar tech company in Nigeria. 

These opportunities are strictly numbered. If you fail to get it, you most likely will spend another year, wasted, looking forward to the next one.

You don't get to hop to a nearby institution to prepare for the future. There are no nearby institutions of opportunities in Nigeria. You sit in a school for six years learning "secretariat studies".

You will wait another full year. And another. And another. And you will not be able to graduate early enough to know what to do with your life.

So it does make sense why trolling is a career.

The least you can do with your life is not focus on your own misery when you can mock Tiger Woods, for instance.

Let's imagine there's nothing he has that you want. I mean, why would you want anything Woods has? You are a troll, your cyber life is puuuuurfect. All these "friends", fellow trolls, 12 likes on a comment... how can you give that up to be a Tiger Woods?

Why would you want to be Oris and go abroad and write about art when you can be a troll and drop LOLs everywhere?

Why should you be TK and be on the speed dial of corporate giants who give real  money for biographies when you can write the best sub on social media and get jobless clowns to crown you the Queen/King of shade?

Why look for a real job and FOCUS on it when you have social media that protects your impoverished reality from even you?

This facade is sweet nah.

After 5 years, you'll be consoled that, at least, you followed every sub, attended every shade, never missed a cyber conflict, typed "gbam" as many times as possible, joined one hundred WhatsApp groups where articles you could never write are analysed by people with brains as smart as a ball of akara.

There's not one troll, causally leaving their imprint on every wall, that is successful.

I do not stand to be corrected. It is a mathematical certainty that you cannot be successful in reality and be a troll at the same time.

You cannot multitask with social media trolling. You either face your life and succeed, or you face your troll profession and be content with the pleasures it gives.

This is perfectly OK.

People do not wish for other people to be smart, anyway. The opportunities for smart people in Nigeria are quite few. You want to be the one who gets the job or gets the call or gets the grant when you ask.

You want to be the actress who gets the Oscars from Africa. No, there can't be two of you, sorry. The "African win" is just for one person. Probably next time.

The more stupid people there are (or distracted by social media rubbish), the more opportunities for the few smart ones.

The consequences of that is, of course, wretched under-development. But it is not your fault nah. 

It is the era of shocking idiocy.

How a one-hundred-and-twenty-thousand naira writing job, for instance, could have no name on it... in a country where minimum wage cannot buy you rice to eat.

YET people have so much time to waste. To be endlessly petty.

I doff my hat for this kind of idiocracy. 

I am impressed. You all have guts to chest poverty, and your dreams can wait forever. Phew.

But I assure you, the smart people are not complaining.

Everyone is a writer on social media, but only one person will get their Play sponsored by British Council next year (PS: I'm rooting for Temitayo Olofinlua).

That is how life will always be. The majority will always be stupid and insignificant.

And that is perfectly OK.
