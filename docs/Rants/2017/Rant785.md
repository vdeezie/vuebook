An authority did this to a child (see pix below)

That authority, a father with his wife, beat the child to death. 

I have always questioned authority. From teachers, to pastors. Fortunately, there was no heavy-handedness in my upbringing. My rebellion at home was limited. If any. But I have always been defiant.

I question everything.

I have a problem with the idea of living under rules made by someone else for my benefit. You cannot make good intentions on my behalf. I have to be part of the rules that are meant to govern me. You cannot care more for me than for your own needs. There’s too much room for abuse when a person is denied the opportunity to be part of the regulations that guide them.

It is my biggest worry with religion. You are shoving down rules of 2,500 years old, yet you do not expect people to question these laws. What do you think we are, dry log?

Same with culture, even more dogged than religion. Norms practiced since the time the first cave man killed an animal and wrapped its fur around his body. Yet, we are meant to follow the doctrines and authority of old worn customs.

It is the same approach we have with uncles who eventually rape children. It is the approach we have with our religious centres.
You fuck out of marriage, then the next minute, tithe in hand; you think your tithe will absorb that sin. You offend even God with your habits.

In Nigeria, the citizens are not expected to question the laws that govern them. Like our pop(ular) religions, we just follow.
As followers, we have no need to develop brainpower. Even when we try we fail, because you can’t become a tiger when you have been trained to be sheep.

It is why the LAUTECH student leaders would go back to their oppressor, the governor of Oyo state, and BEG him to forgive them!

By God, we are finished in this country!
You are treated worse than dog poop, yet you go back to the one who humiliates, and you beg.

You beg because even though you tried to be a lion, your mind is sheep.

I owe nobody any explanation why I want to run a social movement. Be sure not to give your Nigerian counsel to me.

Be ashamed instead that young Nigerians will crawl back to a scumbag like Ajimobi and ask for forgiveness.

There are two things at play here: Ageism and Kyriarchy. 

It is not political parties that will address these issues. We are blinded by many things. Politics in a third world country is inspired by greed. Period. Bright people run under these parties, and they come out as dumb as those they once criticized.

In our unrepentant “humility” we are concerned instead of the need for one person to assume herself able to change things. We are offended. As if anybody cannot start social movement.Go abroad and see the number of social groups they have.

As a matter of fact, we should have pressure groups in every local government, amongst every 30 people within a space.

What I am doing is not exceptional, it is what people who can take a break from eating the shit from the butt of their oppressors should do.

Start a social movement wherever you are. Gather 10 people in your vicinity, hold a meeting, get a water-tight plan and confront constituted authorities. The ones feeding on the future of your unborn children.

It is nothing special. It is not messiah complex, it is YOU trying to save the space that you inhabit from being deliberately attacked by hyenas.

Children were kidnapped from a Nigerian-Turkey school over the weekend, but we are all at work, trying to make a naira. 

Do you know what they do to little girls when they are kidnapped?

If a group of people rise up to demand better security in schools, the rest of Nigerians will sit in their disgraceful comfort zones and judge them. Criticise their methods, analyse their approach.

Well, fuck you!

Have you ever wondered why Aisha Yesufu is so HATED by Nigerians?

“Oh shit, she has messiah complex...”
“She wants to take the glory and the shine of the #BBOG movement.”
“How can she speak to constituted authority like that?”
“She wants a whole Buhari to follow her to Sambisa.”
“It is paining her that they did not give her political assignment.”

That is the bile that falls off the anus of Nigerians about a woman who decided to do something. Your interpretation of what her intentions are DO NOT COUNT.

Whether you like her or not, doesn't count.

If you forget anything this year, remember this:

Students of LAUTECH went back to ask for forgiveness from their oppressor!!!

Let that stay with you and torment your lack of sense until you are ready to shut up when others want to change the way things are.

Again, fuck you very much.

PS: From my last count, The Nigerian Revolution is now 96 members strong.
