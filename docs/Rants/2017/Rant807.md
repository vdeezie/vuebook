Ah! My mother! LMAO!

When I made that trip with my boyfriend a few weeks back, my mother sent me a list of what she'd like me to buy...

Bushmeat was top on the list. She said she would fall sick if I didn't buy her bushmeat. Hian! 

Other items listed were: bundle of unripe plantain, basket of agbalumo, snails, palmoil, tubers of yam.
Signed, 
Dear mother.

When our short vacay was over, my boyfriend took the list and did all the running around.

When he came back with an animal crucified on a stake, an inviting aroma perfect for a pot of oha soup... he was panting as if he did the killing. Lol!

"Your mum would have yanked off 10 yards of my boyfriend material," he said, "I almost bought rotten meat!"

Ha! Rotten bushmeat is the worst thing you can do to an Igbo woman!

Thankfully, the aroma gave it away. He returned it to the woman, questioned the state of the bushmeat.

The woman confessed and gave him a fresh one. He is nice, I would have left her shop and patronised someone else. 

At the end of shopping, he got mum all what she wanted. Everything. 

I delivered them to her. And told her I didn't spend a dime. She was grateful; she sent her prayers, which I couriered to my yoruba angel.

This evening, I paid her a visit. After an hour gossiping about everything on earth, as I was about to leave, she called me...

"Isi?"

"Yup?"

"I need something desperately."

"What is it?"

"In fact, I keep thinking about it. I really need it. I feel like I will fall sick if..."

"Another bushmeat?"

"No. No."

"Then what do you need so desperately?"

"Ice cream. I need ice cream."

Hian!

I asked which flavour she'd like.

"Any flavour," she said. "Use your discretion."

Double hian. 

"Make it a big bowl of ice cream, please."

"Is it good for you?"

"I don't care. I want to eat it."

"OK. I shall get you the biggest bowl I can find."

"Ah! Thank you."

For a minute, she looked so much like Jolade. 

And it warmed my heart :)
