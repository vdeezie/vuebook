Some years back, a very good friend "fell in love" on my wall.

She met someone here and went full throttle into a relationship with him. They made me aware of this. I tried not to be involved, but in some ways she felt I had brought her this goodluck of finally meeting the man of her dreams.

The more excited she got about this love she had found on my wall, the more I tried to stay away from it. Because everyone knows how these stories go.

It didn't take long, he left her.

She cried and wanted me to get him back for her. She wanted me to talk him back into loving her.

And I despised that assignment, you see. Deep down, I don't care about people's love relationships. Unless we have built some kind of interest in careers and mutual respect as regards our personal journey devoid of men, I can't take you seriously. I don't form relationships with women based on heartbreak stories. For instance, I have NEVER met Prisca's boyfriend(s). I'm sure in a period of 5 years as friends, she must have had a few. I just don't want to know except she is willing to share (and she loves to share that part of her life, so I listen). I am more interested and intrigued by other aspects of a woman's life. 

So here I was with a friend who was crying on the phone every other day, begging me to help her get her man back, since he considered me a mentor.

Ugh!

The relationship lasted barely three months. He walked away and he didn't even tell me he did. She did. Yet in some ways I am supposed to bring out my wand and change his mind.

I wouldn't. And I told her that much.

But I did rebuke him when I had the chance, and I told him what he did and how he did it was not elegant. I mean, it's all about approach and perception.

After she realised I wouldn't get him to want her anymore, she blocked me on Facebook and stopped talking to me in realtime. 

But check this out, she is still in contact with the man who broke her heart till date. 

So I alone suffered the decision of a man who didn't want to be with a woman because they met on my wall. Pray tell, how does that make sense?

That girl was all over me with praises at the beginning oh. Always telling me how knowing me was the best thing that happened to her life yada yada. Yimu!

Because of that one scenario I deleted quite a number of men on my list to give an unequal ratio between men and women, and the slimmer possibilities of treating my wall like a speed dating site. And I also wouldn't let followers have any say here. I do not want to be responsible for what people decide to do with their hearts. I focus on the mind. Let's talk business, let's work on a project, let's make money, let's be financially and emotionally independent. Surely there's more to life than the throbbing of your clits.  

Let's make irrelevant what men do to us. 

If women can just agree on this one thing, we'll evolve faster.
