Hey look! I've got an extra N5 to invest in your 2017, dear Millenials. 

*
So... two weeks ago I did a post where I asked for writers with interest in sports, politics and branding to send their CVs. 

I got over 50 entries.

9 entries had no cover letter, so I sent to spam. 

10 entries were begging for the job, I had to delete.

14 entries weren't certain of their skills and what they could really do but they want the job anyways. Delete.

6 entries did not match my present demands. Saved in a folder for later.

10 entries want to intern. Internship is a good thing but Nigerians have a different meaning to it. They actually need you to stop what you are doing to teach them, instead of learning on the job. They need you to teach them how to construct sentences. We don't have that kind of time anywhere in the world except if you are called a teacher.

One entry, Izu, sent a cover letter, his CV and articles in one mail.

That article he sent, after a phone interview, was published that day.

He has written more than 15 articles since then.

He earned a salary just at the tip of December. His January pay (per article) is looking really good.

He is proactive, smart and writes well.

I told him I'd like him to earn more by running a sports show on Happenings Radio along with his articles on the website.

He sent a podcast the next day. When I didn't respond to the podcast in 24 hours, he sent a mail with another podcast and a message:

"Ms. Joy, I had to listen to your podcasts on the site only after my first attempt. I believe your silence means you do not approve of my work. I have done a better version. And I can do a third one if you need a bit more fire."

Izu comes with more than average intellect. Persistence is a good thing when you are smart, competent and you know what is required of you. 

However, persistence is an affliction on the recipient when you don't know jack! 

Nigerians are persistently talentless. That is the problem. That is the thin line. 

Go out and get what you want, demand, knock on doors, bring down walls... but...err...know your competences and skills first.

Be that number 1 out of a 50.

Be like Izu.

Eku New Year oh!
