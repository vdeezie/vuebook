12 jaguda facts about  the domestic abuser in a country like Nigeria:

1. He is deeply religious, serving the Lord. 

2. He is  shocked that you allow him get away with slapping you. When he graduates to hitting you in the stomach, he wonders if you have sense at all.

3. He likes food. Fresh food every day, else slap is your portion. 

4. He cheats. You can't have sex satisfactorily with the thing you abuse frequently nah. You need something else, something fresh without scars, to screw. 

5. It is not true that the "long hand of the law" will catch up with him, not true at all. One guilty verdict out of 5000 cases is not justice - at all. He knows this. It gladdens his heart. Nigeria is a great country, he smiles. The law is a dwarf.

6. He is pals with his pastor. Pastor will pray for him after you report another abuse. His sins are immediately forgiven. If you show up consistently, pastor is going to ask you what you keep doing to annoy him. REPENT, woman! Yes. You are the problem. Not his fist. 

7. He doesn't care about your family. Actually, he wonders what kind of mother/father tells you to stay in an abusive marriage? "What desperate idiots you are!" He says to himself.

8. He is on social media telling men not to abuse their women.

9. When you die, his crocodile tears will serve the purpose. His mother-in-law is going to protect him anyway. 
"How can you say my son-in-law killed my daughter?" She will cry.
"What a dumb bitch, this old woman!" He too will cry.

10. He will not let any man treat his daughter (the one you had with him) the way he treated you.

11. Even in death, he still believes you are the cause of your own demise.

12. He will move on. And never visit your grave. He will miss your hot meals because the instagram chick he is currently dating doesn't have time to cook fish peppersoup by 2am. That's the only karma he suffers in this entire comedy series.
