My mum would scold my children for not jumping all over me whenever I pick them up from hers.

My children don't have that common enthusiasm most children have. They are not overly excited about anything; if it ever happens, it usually last for just a minute. 

They don't scream UP NEPA. And they never find a reason to be excited when an uncle, aunt or cousin visits (not that anybody comes to my house).

Their "thank you" is quick and smart. Then on to the next.

For years my mother complained. 

"Can't you scream and hug your mother? Na wa oh!" She'd lament. My kids would chorus a quiet "good evening, mummy" and back to whatever they are doing. 

I didn't see anything wrong with that. And I used to tell my mum to let it be.

-Because really, that over-the-top Naija pikin enthusiasm is a script adults produce for children to perform.

One of my former neighbours had a little girl, barely six, who would come to my door to beg for cold pure water by 10pm. She cried always. She seemed really lonely, neglected, deprived of love.. But when daddy comes back from wherever, she'd scream and hug him.

One day, his estranged wife picked the kid from school and took her to Benin without her daddy's consent. 

Daddy cried and made a "daddy scene" in the neighbourhood (again, a script). Daddy fell on me and lamented over the "kidnapping" of his "life".

But that "life" was never truly happy.

And when that "life" was asked if she wanted to return, she said "No".

My kids aren't good actors. If you walk into my home, they'll say hi and they'll ignore you almost immediately. It's that simple. 

And I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

So the idea of jumping on mummy and being perfect enthusiasts welcoming me from work, is not us.

We don't do that. 

It'll be cool to get a hug, yes. But it has to happen naturally. It has to come from the heart, from a place of knowledge, of awareness. 

I will not force anyone to "love" me. Not even my kids (of course, my kids love me).

"Love" in this instance being the zealous high jump from the bedroom to the living room door just to welcome a mother they saw only a few hours ago. 

Tell me that isn't bullshit. 

So their grandma complains, and I smile. I have never asked them why they don't jump, scream and summersault when adults visit.

They don't want to. Period.

Lately, I see that things have changed.

When I pick my children from school, Ife always has a big smile, then she starts to dance. They give me a big hug and proceed, with enthusiasm, to tell me all about their day.

Today, they sat at the the back seat, content.

"We love you, mum," Ife said.

Jolade hugs me every other minute I walk by. She grabs my wide waist and sinks her head in. 

Ife humours me by crouching a little to kiss my cheek (just to show off her height. Lol!)

I know what happened.

They are having conversations with classmates. They realise they always have more money than others. They've watched more movies at the cinema than others. They've read a whole lot more books than any child in class (and I dare say, in school). They've observed the relationship some parents have with their kids. They have probably heard stories of physical abuse. 

As children grow older, conversation becomes more sincere. In those moments, they realise how lucky they are. (For some, unlucky).

That everything they ever ask is provided. 

Appreciation meets love... and here we are.

Their eyes light up every time I walk in.

"Do you know you are the finest and the coolest mum ever?" Ife said a week ago and placed a hand on my head. "But you are short," she laughed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

They came to this point of enthusiasm by themselves. No scripts. 

Let it happen naturally.
