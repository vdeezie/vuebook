So one of the estate gatemen was drunk and decided to be a nuisance this evening as I drove my way out. 

No wahala, I decided to meet him on his level.

Whilst he was screaming and convulsing a load of diatribe, he said: "I get your type for house."

I laaauuuuughed! 

"Bros, if you actually have my type at home, you won't be here; you won't end up a security guard." Fact.

De thing pain am! 

Not that I think there's no dignity in being a security guard, but this drunken one is a piece of shit.

You can't have a woman like me in your life and be a security guard. Silly negro trying to judge me and some random wife of his on the basis of gender. 

Breasts, buttocks and vagina don't make a woman.

If you don't know what makes a woman, then you are probably still below the bar of value, relevance and importance. You too should probably go get a job as a security guard. No upgrade for you.

In other news, I'm chilling in my hotel room. And I can't order food because, well, I need my dress for tomorrow to fit nicelyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Fashion is pain.
