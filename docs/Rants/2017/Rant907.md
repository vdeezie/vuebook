Office yarn.

So we had a meeting at the office with a new marketer. 

One madam.

You can tell she has walked the breadth of Lagos as a marketer. You can tell she has seen things, and is formed in her ways.

No wahala.

So I and the other 3 bosses (all men) running the other companies under our parent company, Axon, wanted to ENGAGE her.

That word Nigerians are frightened of.

But you see, we (heads of companies) know all about engagement. That's what we do best. We rub minds, we fight, we disagree, we bring forth superior arguments. But one thing we never do is shut down communication. We always put aside egos and come back to the table to ENGAGE.

These are smart men. And I am grateful to work with them.

So, anyways, we have this new woman in our midst,  and in our typical fashion we try to engage her in conversation on how she plans to market the brands.

She got defensive, which was quite hilarious because, well, we don't run tinz like that. Whether you vex or not, you will still engage us.

How are we going to trust you with our brands if you can't communicate effectively with us?

We don't hold morning prayers in the office. We never say "by the grace of God" as a means to justify inefficiency. We don't assume people are smart or they know what they are doing. We slaughter opinions in our meetings... (by God, we are savage); and we demand an exchange of ideas.

But this was all too much for her. She went on the defensive. And I marveled.

Do we expect to have jobs where we do not get into intellectual confrontations or debates with others? So just because you say, "I know my job", is that any reason for us to believe you?

Our communication is probably the best thing we have in the company. We can ENGAGE for Africa. It is always the first step to greater things.

So one of the boss men, seeing how poorly she was reacting to our questions and opinions, said to her: "don't worry when you bring your ideas, we will accept them."

"No, don't say that," I interjected,  "we won't accept ideas until we can ENGAGE. And some ideas will not be accepted. It isn't personal."

After a while, we all started drawing invisible circles on the table.

When that happens, know that we are gearing up for a little bumpy ride ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
