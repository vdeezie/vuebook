A little girl is screaming next to her mother's shop...

"I am the greatest!"

It is something I have never heard before, such grand enthusiasm. I had to see for myself the owner of this tiny voice, hungry for greatness. 

From my balcony, I see her in a small purple dress.

Ah bless! She is as cute as a button. I watch this rare sight.

Later she starts to jump, with her hands up in the sky, trying to catch an invisible something. 

"I am the greatest!"

Indeed you are, sweetheart. I smile to myself.

"Greatest!" She clenches her fist and groans. Like a cub that can't wait to become a lioness. Lol!

Everything was going fine oh - she, proclaiming her greatness; and me, from a distance, appreciating her greatness...

Until her mother shows up. Pulls her aside, smacks her lightly on her back and says something to her.

From that distance there's no hope of knowing what transpired in 30 seconds; but Miss Greatness isn't so happy anymore. Soon enough, it is clear...

The young performer tweaks her pronouncement...

"I am a child of god," she manages to scream, not as passionately as she did before when she was great. 

She says it one more time without much conviction or enthusiasm and then walks away to the corner of the building to play with dead leaves.

She could have been great, you know?

Why can't a child just be the greatest without the burden of religion or appropriate religious declarations cramping her style?

She just wants to be great at that moment.

May be tomorrow she'd focus on being a "child of god".

Let children be great. Just let them.

A child's greatness should be proclaimed. 

I'm sure God doesn't mind.
