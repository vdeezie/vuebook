I would drive all the way to the end of town to get my groceries. The store is a small room by the corner of a street. The Yoruba owner – a woman hitting 50 has three small children, three sales girls, two wandering sales boys, and one elderly woman whom, I believe, she inherited from her own mother. She is caregiver of her clan. 

But why do I make these long trips to her small store every other day – sometimes four days a week? I never really thought about it until I started a conversation with my kids recently.

“There is a YES supermarket around the corner. CityDia is just across the street. We have up to ten random superstores on our side of town, but you have to drive all the way to that store almost every day. Why?” they asked.

And it hit me, as I drove home after another visit to the store and paying N18,000 for a bag of knickknacks with absolutely nothing in it; the woman had to make the calculation again. Even she was shocked (pleasantly so) of the insignificance of the naira to any modest shopping. 

“I like strong women,” I responded to my kids, and felt a peace immediately. That was the answer to my regular trip to a store with no name, no grand intent, no contemporary, suffocating branding.

I like strong women. And if a strong woman grows a mind of her own, then I’ll be there every time it is necessary to support her.

In my world, there’s nothing as beautiful as a woman with strength of character, wit, and a dogged chase to discovering more of herself, with a mind set to protect her sanity and groom her sense of being. 

Then a few months back, before the end of an academic session, Jolade said offhandedly, “Do you know her son attends my school? He is in my class.”

Oh wow. The woman with the small store and no formal education  has a child in my daughters' school. She is paying the same N70+ for new school uniforms (as they move from primary to secondary); she is doling out the same amount for school fees. She doesn’t meet with filmmakers to talk about movies and TV synopsis. She isn’t getting red carpet invites and tossing them in the bin. She probably doesn’t know how to use a laptop or what “efficacious” means. She probably wouldn’t understand if I told her I am a writer. Ok? You write, but how do you make money? What are you selling? Where is your shop? 

Nonetheless, we are living the same reality.

She probably thinks I am some high-flying banker, working a 9-5 in red stilettos. She’d be shocked to know how similar we are – she, always sitting in her store waiting for customers, and me in my bed, butt red hot after hours writing TV episodes and trying to find a way X must fall in love with Y, without a lazy writer attempt to jump into a Nollywood conclusion. 

We are women who have turned parenting into exquisite art form.

All the more reason for my ride to her store to support this woman. Even if it’s just butter we are getting, we will take that trip. She has school fees to pay, and that school fees is not beans at all. I should know.

I stand for strong independent women.
