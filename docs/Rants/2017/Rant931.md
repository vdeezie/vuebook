So last week I gave almost all my clothes and bags to the Benevolent Unit of Daystar church - for underprivileged women and children (thanks to Modupe Ogundeji for the hookup). Some of the clothes I never wore. All the bags were purchased from my friend, Teetee. Some of them still brand new, never been used. But I've had them for over a year, and I thought it'd be good to share this lovely stuff with other women who can't afford these things. I am hoping they appreciate the quality of the bags, 'cos it cost me quite a sum building my bag collection. 

Handing them to the delivery man, I almost thought to withdraw some clothes oh. I actually saw brand new dresses I never wore. WTF! Ugh! I had to shut these pair of eyes and let the pretty dresses and blouses go!

Children clothes nko? And school bags. I don't know what my problem is, but I know it has a medical term... this idea of buying school bags every new term; buying new school shoes. That idea of new-everything at the start of a new term is some kind of obsession for me.

So some really cool bags had to go. Jolade saved two of her bags though.

Whew!

When everything was gone, I heaved a sigh of relief. 

I love space more than anything else in the world. I want empty rooms. I want to see nothing but a bed in a bedroom, and a couch in a sitting room. Nothing else.

Space helps me think. I have zero interior decor craving. I detest homes with too much aesthetics. 

I am a writer. I am always looking for blank spaces to fill. I want a blank house I can fill with my imagination. I decorate a home in my mind; I don't want to see the decor in reality.

None of that gesture was done for any altruistic purpose, really. I have too much everything, I had to give all of them out and start all over again. Period. 

The motivation was to create space in my home for my mind to fill. That's all. I sincerely wasn't thinking about underprivileged women.

But it feels good, still.

Why am I saying this? Shebi they say one good gesture deserves a reward - or something like that?

So here I was jejely minding my business, when Teetee sent me something; these gifts:

The perfect studded black bag.
Two copies of 'The Diary of a Young Girl' by Anne Frank...

And, wait for it:

FIRE 7 TABLETS!!! Two tablets for my girls!

Wow! Just wow!

So I ask her: what is it that I have done to deserve this kind of generosity? I am a lousy friend. Too busy for my own good. Terrible at keeping in touch. But there she goes, spoiling me silly all the damn time.

I'm yet to get over the gift of "Bedtime Stories for Rebel Girls", now this!

Thank you, friend. Thank you. 

And you know what makes this friendship so beautiful? I'll tell you: It is her desire to give even though she knows I can conveniently afford them. It's so beautiful, I want to cry. 

In her words: "I know your kids have tablets already. I don't care. I am giving them new ones. They are such wonderful girls!"

Ah bless!

May we all have friendships where giving is out of love and not of lack.

If you can drop a "Thank you, Teetee", it'll mean a lot to me.
