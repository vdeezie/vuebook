All these women cooking goatmeat peppersoup for boyfriend... 

Paying his WiFi subscription

Fuelling his car

Contributing to his rent

Cleaning and polishing

Borrowing money from friends to give to boyfriend the minute he carries a long face grumbling about how "business is tough"

Feeding his friends, calling his sister...  

Paying his bail money after the usual Naija Police altercation.

All these amazing female givers of money and pleasure...

I hope your mother has eaten today? I hope she isn't, by chance, lacking anything?

What preek will cause in this world, ehn! Tu fia! 

Isn't it cringeworthy to share all the good you did in a relationship after the relationship is over? Isn't it pathetic? (I mean... the mention of the cooking of a particular food as reason for justice of a broken heart? Hian!)

Do not do anything in a relationship if it'll need a recap, exaggerated mourning, a gathering of sympathy when it is over.

Buy him a pair of socks. Cook him meals. Then rest. Nobody has a garrote around your neck to over-do that which you must perform as a manipulative means to securing the relationship. If he asks, don't give. Tell him to work harder. And if you give, don't demand loyalty or "forever" in return. 

Be an adult, for pete sake. 

The shame of I-gave-him-my-kidney stories, yet someone dear in your family must have died of kidney failure. 

Preek priorities. 

Does anyone still feel sorry for these women? Not me. 

We give women too much attention. They make even elementary issues our problem. 

Keep shifting to the left, abeg.
