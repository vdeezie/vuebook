Nigerian conversations, conferences and summits, even relationship banters bring me so much turmoil. If it is a conference on “Celebrating a New Generation of Women”, for instance, I have my heart in my mouth because I KNOW something disastrous is going to happen sooner. One of the speakers is going to sashay her way to the podium, hold the mic, smile at her helpless audience and spew something tragic like…

“Women, as the neck of a man…yada yada.”

There, my heart already in my mouth, turns to biscuit. I’d have to chew it and walk away, asking God why he made me a woman – this incredibly confused gender. Why? Why?!

I held a conference at Oriental Hotel a while back. The conference was on Child Abuse. And one of my speakers told the story of lesbianism and how she had to be cured from it. In other words, after years of abuse from men, she “ran into” lesbianism because it was only another woman that was willing to love her right… but then a pastor-man cured her of such. And my heart broke for this great ignorance. I remember two women walked out immediately she said that. Not even me and my heterosexual liberal ass could make them stay.

It takes one sentence for a Nigerian to ruin everything. And it ALWAYS happens, because our knowledge is proudly half-baked, poorly sauced, badly sautéed. We are in a hurry to know a little about something and become authorities on that which we don’t yet fully understand.

It is why you have certified therapists who counsel from the bible. How can you counsel anyone from a bible? If I wanted Bible quotes wouldn’t I visit a pastor? You are a therapist for crying out loud. You know?

At police stations, you go there to seek justice… but an officer dressed in his official uniform (not a cassock) will badger you to forgive the accuser. It’s shameful.

I read only two days ago, a woman who was supposed to be responding to a post on divorce, and she managed to tell us how she couldn’t have avoided her own divorce because husband was gay, and when she found out, she tried to keep it hush-hush so marriage can continue… a long ass report about her “misfortune”, even though this was not my kind of post to read, I knew something colossally idiotic will happen before I get to the end of it.

And there it was, I found it, smiled and said to myself, “of course, I would be shocked if I didn’t find the Nigerian idiocy somewhere in all of this babble”.

You know what she said?

Paraphrased: I would have gladly loved to be beaten over and over again if only he would change and stay and love me.

Yes. A grown woman with something like a brain makes a case for divorces with this puke. And you are supposed to “feel for her”, extend your sympathies towards her.

Nigerian feminsists… where do I even start with those ones? They believe in equality, but when they fall out with a friend, the first thing that drops from their skull is…

“Bitch! You slept with Emeka – that broke guy.”

LOL! I mean, these people are idiots, clearly.

The e-hustlers of this feminism thing are still trying to figure out if it is ok to let go of a relationship and pursue proper careers. They have extensive debates on how women should position themselves to be “found”.

I am yet to meet any group of persons so ignorant in their own beliefs, yet too busy slaying to get proper knowledge on the movement they claim to be running with VIP tickets.

You are sitting with a man who believes he is, well, contemporary and he is saying shit like, “women are nurturers, they are supposed to take all the trash of the world and turn them to gold.”

You turn to the other side and a woman you are trying to fit into a friendship box is uttering crap like, “men are like daggers, they know what they want so they shoot and get their prey. If you position yourself well, the right dagger will stab your heart and own it.”

A woman is supposed to be this. A man is supposed to be that. Minds stuck in a tiny box unable to breathe or accommodate real conversations. We might as well be goats, moving round a chalk line, believing it is iron bars stopping it from stepping out of its myopic thoughts.

They tell you about a contemporary pastor and how you need to try this church. “He is not like the rest of them, that is why I go there.”

You go there, and the first sermon is about how alabaster box was broken by a woman to worship her master… and how women should give of their alabaster (their most precious self) to love the men they yada yada.

Then the next sermon will be about Ruth, how she positioned herself. And all these gaddamn rules from the year of the consulship of Messalla and Quirinius, and how we should be shaped by these 12 BC crap.

Our conferences are the worst. If you like your sanity and you are not into constant regurgitation of patronizing women, stay away from conferences that promise to liberate the Nigerian woman or celebrate the Nigerian woman or applaud the Nigerian woman.

You will find one of your women leaders with her fine satin suit telling you what is stopping you from becoming a success, like her, is because of the way you dress – these unwholesome attires of jezebel that are not turtle-necks or scarf-ed around your bust is what is making it hard for you to find a respectable man, and in essence find your calling that will lead you to greatness.

When she’s done putting more shackles on your feet, and you nodding like a stupid lizard, your wealthy Nigerian woman will mount the stage and tell you how it is very important to cook your husband food and wash his clothes with your bare hands, else you will never climb to the top.

And you sit all through this mess. Women of Nigeria, you will never find liberation. Not in the next century, I tell you.

Men go into conferences, talk about business and moving forward, argue and win or lose arguments. Not once do they get to lay their ambitions next to having a partner.

Yet we are angry we don’t have enough women in power. Put a woman in power, she’ll be the one to start a campaign against short skirts and instruct the police to arrest women with dresses above the knee. Put a woman in power and she’ll be the lecturer who tells an entire body of students that “girls are the cause of rape.”

LOL!

See your relationship advisers telling battered women to pray. LMAO! Oh! And some tell women what men are looking for, as if man is the prize.

Nigerian conversations, conferences and summits, even relationship banters bring me so much turmoil. I don’t even know how you people keep friendships and have to hear your friends talk like true Nigerians.

I don’t have hypertension. The one that is worrying you people is not the one worrying me. My worry is this 3.5 liter of Egusi soup my second cook made that I ate once and realized I should never make egusi in that quantity when there’s afang and edikaikong to be made.

That’s my legit worry.
