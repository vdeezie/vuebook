Pastor says..."Women who have their bath after 7pm are inviting evil spirits into their lives".

Another one says, "Don't wear high heels. It distracts you from the things of the lord".

Then another one: "Jewelleries *sic* is evil for any woman to wear."

Oh, here's another one: "Makeup is the devil's tool."

There are more...

"Immediately a man says hello, ask him when you are getting married. Else you are a used woman."

"Kneel and serve your man so he knows you have the spirit of God."

"A godly woman does not argue or speak loudly."

"Caesarean operation is not of god."

"No woman should be on top or sit on her man whilst making love. That position is orchestrated by the devil."

"Motherhood is the most important role in the life of a woman."

"Pray for your abusive husband. God hates divorce."

"He is the head. You are the neck."

"Do not wear clothes that expose your lap."

And on and on and on... until what is left of every woman (who embraces religion) is only but a speck of dust.

Religion will continue to demand and order you around for as long as it can get you to stay afraid. 

What religion will do to black women will eventually be as devastating as the Holocaust. 

Woman, religion believes you are an inferior gender; it's the reason your life and activities are under scrutiny; it is why you are constantly reviewed. 

Religion treats you like a threat to its purity. 

You are impure. You will always be that way in the eyes of religion.

These things only exist around your space if you let it, of course.

Good luck.
