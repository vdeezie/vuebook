Owing to the influx of male interest and attention I get... I think it is important I address this once and for all:

I am not a media mogul. 

I don't know what instablog was smoking when they wrote that title but eet eez not me.

No, I am not insinuating that you are toasting me because of a title. I am just stating a truth. 

So now that you know, let me carry on.

I don't spend on men.

If I can recall correctly, I have bought a pair of socks, a watch, bedspread, and cake for an entire two decades of being in the dating scene. Put that side by side the daily sacrifices of the Nigerian woman, you'd find that my attempts at affection are disgraceful. 

I have cooked plenty of soups though. That should count for something.

I don't date broke. I don't like broke men. I am not 21 so there's no future to be waiting for. This day is my future. This moment. I am living in my future. Come correct or don't come at all.

I don't date younger men. OK that's a lie. Of course I date younger men. I'm 40. There are not many sane above-40 men who are available. And a lesser number I'd be interested in.

But I wouldn't go below an age limit. 20s is out of it, of course.  However I've been swept off my feet by a much younger man in his early 30s not so long a time.

The moments I dated almost a decade younger were for specific reasons:

The first was exceptionally brilliant.

The second was exceptionally rich.

And I ENJOYED every minute of it all; even in our moments of chaos.

I believe in the man displaying a lot of financial muscle. That's OK. I am, after all, not a feminist.

I don't play mummy to any man. I am not your mother. I am not a heroine either. I can't save you.

If you are weak, I can't make you stronger.

I like men who have their shit together.

In general, as a woman in the dating scene, I have been spoilt by men.

I wanted a watch for my birthday, Handsome sent me N100k. 
I wanted a bag, Amazing sent me N65k.

And I am celibate. Whether you want to believe that or not.

As a matter of fact, I have spent more time celibate in this life than I have sexually active. And it is never deliberate. I just happen not to be having any sex all the freaking time. LMAO!

It's a mystery even I can't figure out.

What else?

I guess that's all for now.

Oh! We can split bills during dates, but after a while I get irritated by it all. It's either you are paying or I am paying. That entire split business is just not my vibe.

So you see, I am not the woman you are looking for. Don't let dimples fool you.

I do have a few recommendations though - my friend Maureen Chinwe Onyeziri is everything that I am and more. And she is way younger. You may want to add her up.

Prisca Egbukuchi is single and ready to mingle.

Who else? 

Show your interest. Trust me there are some cool guys in my inbox that might just be the man for you. 

Happy discovery!
