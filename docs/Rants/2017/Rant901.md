I gave a few pairs of my heels to the shoemaker by the gate of our Close to mend. The rubber caps were bad. He charged me N800.

When I got them back, I decided to wear one pair to the office. Before I made it to my car, the entire three storey building of my heels came crashing down. Apparently, the shoemaker used gum, a bit of saliva and sand to patch the caps. He had no skill on how to fix heel caps. My first plan was to take it to a skilled cobbler, but I have no idea where to find one. I took my chances with the shoemaker in the neighbourhood.

I went back in to change to something else. I checked all the heels he claimed to have fixed, and I easily pulled out the caps from the cheap gum he used.

I said nothing to him. I threw the shoes inside the wardrobe. Someday I’ll find a cobbler.

So I was gisting with my girls about this fraud, and Ife said: “But he is right there at the gate. You need to get your money back.”

“Does he look like someone with N800 left in his pocket?” I laughed,” I am not going to fight someone who doesn’t even have a toilet to defecate in.”

It’s the same issue with the disgruntled shoemaker who shares the post with the security guard near my office. I tip the guard everyday just so he can maintain a parking space for me. The shoemaker is obviously pained that he isn’t exactly cashing in on this largesse, so he becomes this bitter little thing, always tossing unpleasant quips in the air, hoping I’ll catch it. Maybe get offended and confront him.

LOL! 

There’s nothing he hasn’t said. One time he was talking to his anus and said, “Na only N200 everyday. Na dat one you go use chop?” 

Says the wretched shoemaker to the security guard who gets N1,000 from me every week just for making a space available for my car. Sometimes, just so I can annoy the heck outta him, I give the guard N500 extra.

Yesterday, whilst I was trying to get my car parked under shelter from the rain. He started farting… “No be becuz we nor get motor person go dey treat us like this.”

Treat you like how? I haven't said a word to this living thing ever. I have not even looked at him to know what he looks like. I would find him some place else and wouldn't even know who he is. I see him through the corner of my eye, in his faded brown shirt. It is his shirt I know. Not him.

I sincerely don’t understand how my car under shelter stops him from getting shelter for himself or buy a car if he wants to. All our dreams are valid.

But then I looked at him… and remembered a shoemaker who dropped his box of tools right beside traffic, and wanted to shit, along the decorated pathway after the CMS bridge only two days ago. It was the most shocking thing I’d seen all week.

I mean… people were taking walks beside him! He pulled his dross down and proceeded to defecate. It took a LASTMA official to get him out of there.

You can’t fight everything that walks. How do I bring myself – with all the blessings I have experienced – to fight a shoemaker?! How?

In all seriousness, anybody who can pay for Clarins should not be caught arguing with people who make lean profit to survive. And I say this with all humility.

These things upset God. He’s going to be up there wondering, “So you are really going to stand there and respond to the bile of a shoemaker? Joy, really? Do you know if he has had any decent meal the entire week? Don’t disgrace me, please? Keep it moving.”

Some things are legit beneath you forever.

PS: However, if his jealousy or ignorance leads him to scratch my car with any of his tools. Then he will know that I don’t believe in karma. Justice is all there is.

He will learn.
