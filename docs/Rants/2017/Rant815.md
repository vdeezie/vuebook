There's a type of parenting I don't understand. Perhaps parents here can explain. 

So last weekend, we went to the mall to get me a bag. When I got to the store, the bag I'd seen a day before through the glass didn't seem so great after all. I had the opportunity to pick another choice (hence the brown bag with the oh-so-sexy-feel I got for Valentine *woot!).

Whilst I was lifting and dropping bags, boyfriend was on a long call, and the sales girl was attending to a few receipts. 

Outside the glass door of the boutique was a child, barely 3 years old, pointing at one of the red Valentine balloons inside the store, crying like he'd puke his intestines out if he didn't get the balloon. I was the only one watching from inside the store. What made it so annoying was the mother who stood there with him, looking. She stood two steps away and just looked helplessly. She would look at her crying son, then look at me... then she'd make those Nigerian weak gestures pleading to the 3 year old to follow her.

At a point, when my expression didn't wear the charm of a woman taken by this crying baby (my stare was blank)... the mother finally lifted her child and walked away.

That was after 10 full minutes crying for a balloon that I had no right to give him, he had no right to take, and his mother had no right to ask for by playing the subtle role of letting the child get away with tantrum...and watching me suffer this tantrum that was not my business to worry about. 

I see this attitude in malls. Children just go crazy and their parents allow them tug and tear at strangers... in response the parents laugh, hoping you'd find the idea of their 4 year old slapping your butt hilarious.  

Me thinks... if you have a child crying for a balloon that is not his, the quickest thing to do is to lift him up and walk away.

There's nothing cute about your child stretching his hand out to grab my icecream cone, for instance. Nothing funny or cute at all. I see total strangers handing biscuits and icecream over to kids who stare too long at their snack. I don't think it is right. 

I do think the best thing to do is: shake the tiny outstretched hand for just a few seconds, and if you can walk away... then walk away.

I am not claiming to be a spectacular parent...so from my unspectacular point of view, I wouldn't want my kid taking anything from a stranger. But first, I'd teach them not to ogle or covet. 

Kids should be satisfied with lack or abundance. If they are denied things from the other side of a glass door, not by the blank stare of a customer but by the insistence of a parent to keep that little cute greed/need in check... then we'll be raising some very self-sufficient humans who can live without handouts.

I think.
