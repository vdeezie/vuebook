Temidayo always says, "my heart goes out to anyone who takes Nigerians seriously".

If you want to grow ugly, wrinkled and painfully old overnight, make Nigerians the source of your convictions and confidence. 

It is a slow rotten death that leads straight to hell.

Everything about us - from culture to religion to politics to social mores - is made to destroy our right to be different. 

My daughter told me that if a child disagrees or argues with the teacher in class, the child would be flogged.

We are training the young generation to be as daft and subservient and confused as all other generations down to the millenials. 

I have instructed my child to ignore everything in school except academics. Listen to them when they teach you Logarithms, but feel free to throw all their moral codes to the bin. I will take care of the moral values, principles of behaviour, scruples and ideals of my children! 

Respect your elders is out of it. 

Respect people of all ages who come with integrity and dignity and purpose. Get rid of scum of any age with the intent to abuse, use, disrespect and con you.

That's it. 

Indeed I feel pity for anyone who takes Nigerians seriously. A people drilled by organised systems to speak from both sides of ignorance. 

A woman is beaten by a power-drunken soldier. She brings this to the attention of fellow Nigerians...

The Nigerian comments go thus:

"You did not tell us what you did. You look like someone that will provoke a man. You look proud."

I kid you not. I saw that shit with my own eyes on a thread!

*
You are butchered by fanatics for a different belief...

The Nigerian comment: "Those people preaching in the morning are causing a nuisance."

*
Dollar upsurge is hitting N500 to one dollar

The Nigerian comment: "What do you need dollar for? This is a good time to grow naira by promoting indigenous businesses."

Question: Do you have the facilities to promote indigenous businesses. Do you even have basic electricity and/or good roads to transport goods or services?

Egg is now N70. Everything is on the rise. 

The ultimate idiotic Nigerian comment...

"The poor needs entertainment. Let's not bash #BBNaija."

Daft as fuck, these twats. 

Ask yourself, can the poor afford DSTV?

Is #BBNaija for the poor? 

Olodo.

Can the driver afford the distraction of Big Brother?

Can you with your pretentious importance pay for GOtv? Can you afford DSTV premium bouquet?

Did you plant a flastcreen in the cubicle of your father's gate man? Is your decoder attached to that screen to entertain the poor with the intrigues of average Nigerians getting set to have oral sex?

We are fighting and defending the right for South Africans to make money off our stupidities.

For those with sense, if you can get out of Nigeria... get out!

Stay in NewYork or Europe and like comments on social media that suggest it is not such a terrible thing to find dead bodies along Northern states... from the comfort of your 911 security dial that protects you from even stray rats.

And if you haven't yet figured out how you can make an escape...

At least eat good food, and love wholeheartedly. 

Toh.
