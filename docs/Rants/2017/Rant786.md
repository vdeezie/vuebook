Life can be a bit of a turd. It is why you would need one person in the entire universe to be present in your life strictly for sowing kind words.

Just one. 

Two or more then you become some kind of narcissist with histrionic disorder.

One person who continues to sow fine seeds of kindness, love, optimism and hope in your daily conversation.  

You don't get to choose them. It is not a job that you get to enforce on your mother or husband or best friend or sister. 

Mba. 

It is a job they choose. 

Their position in your life doesn't necessarily mean they have to be the one to look over your flaws and praise your virtues. 

They have to want to do it. It is important that the sower chooses his/her field.

However, it is OK to confer the position on someone you like/love/admire. If they fail to live up to the duty of making kind words and actions of every experience you record- good or bad or bland, then carry your confernment. Keep looking out for the rainbow some place else. 

Because you need affirmation. Do not underestimate the place of a kind word.

I make it very clear in certain friendships that I am not the one to play that role.

I say that at the very start, just so we know how the truth will be saut√©ed when required. 

If you have assigned the job of sowing kindess to someone and they let you down, it is not their fault. It is not an easy job. Carry your expectations and go.

What you shouldn't do at any time is demand that people be kind when they do not wish to be.

You have a choice. You always do. Use your choices.

Meet someone else who willingly wants to show you kindness.

For instance, if your day is shitty, and the entire world acknowledges how shitty it is... it is the sower-of-kindness that will remind you how beautiful you look even with all the shit that comes with the day.

We all need that.

Or when you'z struggling with the things humans struggle with- self esteem, courage, the illusion of value... The sower-of-kindness is there to tell you (that) you ain't doing so badly on the journey to finding self. 

A constant emotional support. 

Do not let your sitzfleisch make you believe you can do without a cheerleader. 

Just one. Sitting by the corner of the boxing ring, cheering you on. Acknowledging your punches and downplaying the blows you receive to your head from the opponent. 

I hope you find that person. 

Cos it's tough out here.
