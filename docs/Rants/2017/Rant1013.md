Considering the failure of NEPA and the redundancy of a brand new air conditioner in my new room, I had to go get a pedestal fan yesterday, after work.

I had no clue what some of the parts were meant for. Apart from the front and back guard, I was clueless what to do with the screws and attachments.

But I had to use a fan last night. I had to! The first night, I slept with an air conditioner too pompous to be impressed by fluctuating electricity. I was determined to assemble the fan for the next night.

So here I was with a fan motor and its tiny bits and pieces. When I was done assembling, some attachments didn't make it in.

There were no manuals (your fault, Binatone), so I had to guess my way to fresh air.

Some scews couldn't make it in, but the fan worked. And I had a lovely night rest. So much that I missed my morning alarm.

The thing is: all the parts of your life may not be screwed in. 

Truth is: you don't need to get the screws in, as long as you have the basics, you can function. You can go ahead and do stuff. You can be useful. You can live above mediocrity. You can be great. Even when screws don't fit in.

You may not get the screws to fit in, but your fan still works.

You matter. Even if you can't find how the screws of your life fit in. 

Life is not linear. It's screwed up.

That's it.

Good night.
