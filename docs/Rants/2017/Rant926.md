Can we talk about this? 

It's funny and confusing all at once, so please share your intelligent thoughts. 

Yesterday night, we read the story of Coy Mathis, one of the articles in Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls...

Mathis, apparently, is a 10 year old transgender child. Born a boy, (s)he didn't like wearing boys' clothes. One night, he asked his mum, "when are we going to the doctor to have me fixed into a girl-girl."

The surgery happened and he went through the usual issues of acceptance in society... things like that. One of the major issues was: which bathroom should Mathis use?

The school said (s)he should stick with the boys' bathroom or bathroom for disabled children.

Well, Mathis wasn't pleased. They went to court and Mathis won and his parents threw him a party with "pink cake, a sparkly pink dress and beautiful pink shoes".

(S)he is listed in the book as one of the heroes for young girls. 

*scratches head*

Now this is the conversation that happened between Ife and Jolade after reading this out loud:

Jolade: What did I just read?

Ife: I have no idea what we just read. Are we celebrating him/her for turning into a girl or for something else? How did she end up in this book as a role model?

Jolade: Mummy, can you help us understand what makes this boy a success?

Me: Girl. She is now a girl. 

Ife: Whatever. 

Jolade: I have achieved more than this child. I work very hard to be top 3 in my class. At least they should have shared some of his academic success. 

Ife: Did he invent anything?

Jolade: Himself. He invented himself.

Ife: He is your age mate, Jolade.

Jolade: Yes. And he is worried about being a girl? Shouldn't he be satisfied in his body and focus on more important things?

Ife: Mummy is not saying anything.

Jolade: Abeg let us read another story.

Ife: All the talk of "pink pink pink". I thought the idea was for girls to stop worrying over colours. 

Jolade: Ife, please turn the page.

I allow my girls watch some 'Empire' episodes with me. But everytime Jamal is on my screen, having a conversation with another man... I don't even wait for them to get close, I change the channel. 

They'll both scream, "but nothing is happening naaaaaaah!" (I always turn a programme when adults engage passionately, even for PG 13 movies); they don't understand why I do that with Jamal.

I am not ready to have this conversation on homosexuality or Trans with my children. I don't have to state that I am liberal for you to understand that this is definitely not coming from a place of hate. I am just not ready. 

The conversation will happen eventually because there's information everywhere, all around us. But I am yet to gather the right words to hold that kind of conversation. 

What are your thoughts on this?

PS: I trust, as we share opinions, there'd be no need whatsoever to quote a religious book or bash any gay or trans person on this post. 

PSS: Rebel Girls is still a great book. One "uncomfortable" story out of one hundred amazing others does not reduce the relevance of the book at this time when we need girls to embrace their entire being. I still recommend every Nigerian girl child should have a copy.
