I have heard it said many times, in an argument on gender equality or equity... how we respect the work men do.

Something like this:

"Men are really trying. We cannot ignore all they have to go through for their families..."

And I wonder, what do they go through?

This is not medieval times when a man has to go to war, fight until his sword sticks to his palm. No man is David. No man is Jonathan (in the Bible, not your ex-presido)...

No man is Jon Snow. Who fought all his life; was killed, resurrected, and back to fighting.

All a man needs to do in 2017 is sit, think, create, and plan. Like any human being should. 

What really does a man do that makes it impossible for a woman to be equal?

He provides food and shelter and protection for his family- a family he chooses to have.

He pays school fees, pays for the pot of soup, pays rent, and strategises on ways to secure the family's finances for decades to come.

Is that it?

It's not easy, you say. Yes, it's not easy for both men and women. 

Aren't many women working just as hard?

You have three children and a wife, you take care of them, give them the best you can offer... and we have to praise you and applaud you and tell you it is not easy?

Don't a lot of women do this same shit daily without as much as a nod to her hard work? 

Have I not been taking care of two children for upto a decade? Pay school fees, pay rent, protect, provide, give them the best beyond even my abilities?

Who is hailing me and telling me that "you are really trying, and because of your effort you are superior to the man who cannot feed his children"?

No one.

A man manages to buy basic requirements at home and we start worshipping the floor he walks on. Relax abeg, it's basic obligation. If he can't do it, then let the woman do it.

I think we are strung on the fact that many men are irresponsible. It is why we praise to high heavens men who take care of their responsibilities. The ones who take their kids to school, are fully committed financially, participate in the growing years of their children and wards etc. 

We have decided that men can choose to be irresponsible, and when they are not, we should be very grateful. 

Sorry oh, I take care of my children, take care of needs, travel, work, provide like any adult should. Run 101 projects. Source funds etc. 

So that argument of gender equity to balance the great works of men side by side mediocre works of woman is quite silly.

It is not equity we mean when we address gender inequality. 

We mean Equality. 

I think we should focus on the less privileged when we talk about Equity, and not just women.

Many men can't do shit. They are lazy. 10 children and no job. 

7 children, two wives, yet he sells handkerchiefs for a living. A bricklayer with three wives and two concubines. A vulcaniser with six children and agege bread seller carrying his seventh child. 

Equity for all. 

Equality for men and a women.
