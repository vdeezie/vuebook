I had a heated argument with my mum this morning because of #BBNaija.

Imagine that!

I pay her a visit. She's watching Big Brother Naija and eating vegetables. 

I tell her about the sexual harassment. One Kemen groped one Tboss whilst she was sleeping.

Mum says she doesn't like Tboss. 

(The incredible diversion from sexual harassment to a victim's peculiar character)

Why? I ask.

"She's just somehow. She is different. She is always acting superior. She is..."

I am livid. 

"Wait one minute. This woman just suffered sexual harassment whilst sleeping. Can we focus on that?"

"Why didn't she tell her housemates? Why can't she join them in the sitting room and play with them?"

Aaaargh! My head!!!

"Mum! She was groped on LIVE TV! She is living with strangers. You think she owes them any explanation? Why the hell should anyone blame her for Kemen's eviction? He is a fucking pevert!"

"No, I will not agree. This one, I will not agree. It is because Tboss is feeling superior that is why she cannot share her ordeal with the housemates so they can be on her side."

"I don't give a fuck if anybody is on her side. Fuck all of them!" I spit. 

"Then she shouldn't be on Big Brother nah if she is feeling too big and always acting different. She doesn't deserve the money," she spits back.

Lol!

I don't know Tboss or Kemen or TTT. I don't watch the show. I follow the scandalous bits on Happenings website because, well, I manage a lifestyle gig.

But here's the thing... 

I am different, I am the one sitting in the bedroom when everyone else is laughing in the living room. Generic humour annoy me. I am the one who severe ties with women so I can exist alone. I am the one who moves out of a place without informing her next door neighbours...because I just didn't want to. I am the one sitting alone in a bar, having a drink and reading a book. I am the one who dates for poetry, for conversation, for words. I am the one learning and unlearning feminism. 

I am the annoying member of a panel, saying things that shouldn't be said. 

I am different. 

"So mum, should society deny me the opportunity to win in life just because I am different?"

Silence. 

Mum is of an older generation, so it's OK. 

But I have told her countless times that people will decide how best to live their lives. Communal camaraderie isn't for everyone.

And as much as we forgive the older generation for judging people based on their ability to display and parade self in the guise of openness, affability and warmth... 

A crime should not be nulled based on the victim's quirk.

PS: We made up afterwards. And I took a plate of okro soup to cure my vex. Lol!
