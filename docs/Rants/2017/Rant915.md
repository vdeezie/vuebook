You hear about the 70 year old woman shamed for having sex with a younger man. You want to do something about it; the only thing you can really do is gather funds from well-meaning Nigerians, who believe sex is a good thing, to help save this woman from ostracism…

But there’s still an ongoing issue you are involved in regarding a Facebook follower with cancer of the eye. The money is growing slowly…

And there’s the heartrending case of a 6 year old girl raped by her father’s best friend who isn’t getting any attention because daddy needs to protect his friendship than seek any form of justice for his daughter. You have to contact a few friends and see how you can FUND the police to attend to this matter.

And just as you are about to write that appeal to get that 70 year old woman enough room space for sex without intrusion and shame, you read about the woman who suffered domestic abuse for 15 years and is now lying in coma in the hospital. Her face a mash of bloody shit. Ok. Ok. You will first write a long Facebook post to appeal to men to stop abusing their wives, and then you must contact an NGO… and see how much money you can raise to get her shelter and justice.

Phew!

There’s the piece you read about a pastor sleeping with teenage boys, and you need to address that too. Oh! What to do? Write again, asking for the contact of the church so you can lambast the pastor and send him to hell.

You are thinking of hiring a few area boys to beat someone up who stole a cousin’s N500k. That beat-yo-ass money will come out from your wallet, which will affect the good intentions you’d need for the other problems of the world you are neck-deep in.

Your generator just stopped working. You try calling the generator repairer, but a text comes in from one woman, reminding you to raise awareness for an okada accident her son had a few weeks back that is now a lump of decay on his leg. Ok. Ok. You will get to that… after you finish addressing this #NotTooYoungToRun shenanigan on Twitter. What to do? Write a long article on how this will only benefit the children of the elite. Hopefully, ordinary Nigerians will gather sense.

What next? Ok, the 70 year old woman and the freedom of sex… No, that can wait for a few days. Let’s focus on the boy locked up in the toilet for weeks by his father for, well, nothing really… except that his new wife hates the boy. Let’s see, how do we handle this? Hmm! The authorities have to get involved, of course. But, err, the authorities need money to buy fuel for their van… and then money to write petition, then more money to investigate. You write another “Please help this situation” post.

Shit! You just learned that the Facebook follower with cancer of the eye is dead. The money, can it be channeled to some other cause? Not likely. It’s neatly in the care of his mother.

Ok. Ok. What to do? Shake it off. Write a condolence post.

What next? The Police. Ah. Send N25k… for which case now? Ah! A new gist is out! A 3 year old was raped by the school driver. You find it on your timeline. Grrrr!

Wait. Which one should you focus on?

Did you see the flood in Lekki? You rush home; your apartment is a swimming pool.

Shit. Shit.

You put pictures up on Twitter. Tweeps are laughing. They say it isn’t so bad. The water is still below your TV. Stop making noise. Stop seeking attention. Don’t make it look as if APC and Ambode/Tinubu/Buhari aren’t the best pancakes in the world. Shut up and go and remove the pure water sachet from your drainage.

You are enraged! You write a few damning tweets. Ugh!

Someone sends a message to your inbox. She needs help for school. You want to say, “Fuck you, don’t you have hands and legs to work?” But you keep your cool and ignore the message.

Ok. Your house is flooded, but there’s more damage out there. Yes, that 70 year old woman still needs room and privacy to have sex. Now what?

Ok. Police. Ah! Police needs money to track the perpetrators of that walk of shame. They make their bold request. Ok. You send half the sum. Lawyer in Ebonyi needs his own cake.

Ok. Wait. Ayam coming. My house is flooded.

What to do?

You have a headache.

What should you attend to? The caged boy. No, the 3 year old girl raped. No, the abused housewife. No , the area boys who didn’t break the head of that fool. No, the 70 her old sexy woman. No, your generator.

Aaaaaaaaargh!!!

You shut down. Now you are horny. You call your man.

“Baby?”

You enjoy phone sex. Orgasm. Finally.

You close your eyes for a moment to pray for zero shame when you seek orgasm at 70.

That’s it! You choose to focus on that woman. Let’s allow women of all ages have good sex without shame.

-Because you are not the Police; and you cannot save Nigeria. You are going to check on that 3 year old girl though.

Ah! Her mother calls you Jezebel and kicks you out. “Leave my family alone. My daughter is a liar! She wasn’t raped.”

Ok. You walk away. Pfff!

Domestic Abuse victim. She wants her pictures taken down from your wall. “I am trying to reconcile with my husband, please leave me alone.”

Shit! You’ve already raised N100k for this bitch, and it’s sitting in her account. May her face be bruised forever.

Ok. Ok. You need your boyfriend now. Not phone sex. Come here and fuck Nigeria out of my system.

“Baby, I am drowning.”

He knows. He knows. He will give it to you from the back, so he doesn’t see you cry out of pain and pleasure.

NEPA bill arrives. What? N70k for what?

Aaaargh!!!

You holler at a jolly good friend.

“Babe, I need to leave this country for good! How can I proceed?"

Morale of the story: Drops of water will not quench the fire in hell. Nigeria is hell.
