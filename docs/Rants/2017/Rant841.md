The first time...

I was taking a walk to the graphic designer's office to create a new edition of my community magazine, Festac Breed.

My water broke.

So I took a bus to the hospital instead.

Second time...

I was home. It was almost midnight. I felt I should take a dump. Like... I really needed to poop. But it turned out to be labour. 

*
4 things I don't mess with, yea 5 things I don't joke with:

1) My kids.

2) The people I call family.

3) My money.

4) My career

...and as I am growing into 40, one more gets on this list.

5) My Man. Yup, I ain't playing with my man. 
*
I appreciate many acquaintances I have had. Acquaintances drop a word... "Joy, you need to apply for that offer," and things happen. My life changes. 

Motherhood has been great for my mind and my body. Especially my body. I never looked so good until a baby came out of me. My butt got rounder. My boobs got fuller. My skin shone brighter.

Motherhood is good on me. And I am totally committed to loving and raising my girls.

Thanks to everyone who has made this journey fabulous.
