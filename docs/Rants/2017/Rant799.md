The Nigerian Life.

Statement:

“I just got robbed at CMS.”

Answers:

“That’s sad. My neighbour lost two of her phones and her purse at that same spot two years ago.”

“Same thing happened to me at Apapa. I thank God I came out alive.”

“My car was stolen last year under Oshodi bridge.”

“That’s a recurring theme. Happens a lot.”

“My mother says CMS is a death sentence, why should anyone still be using that route?”

“Thank God they did not rob you of life. What you lost can be replaced.”

“I lost a friend at that same place. A bullet to his head.”

“Oh Lord! This is still happening??? I had the same experience in 2014.”

“My brother has beaten up an area boy in that area before. When dem see crase wey pass dem, dem dey know!”

“I nearly lost my darling wife in one of those robberies.”

“May this be the last time you see this kind of experience in your life.”

“That junction is hell. A total calamitous rambunctious higi haga.”

Now rewind. Back to the statement:

“I just got robbed at CMS.” 

It is a complete sentence. An absolute lamentation. A thorough dirge. An award-winning requiem.

It does not require sequels.

What it does demand is SOLUTIONS.

Find solutions to the Nigerian problems.

You have lamented enough.

You have Facebook groups where you lament; Whatsapp groups to lament, Twitter is built for constant lamentations…

You lament to your mother, complain to your friends, lament to your pastor, bewail your condition, lament to God.

Question is: What are you going to do to stop the robberies?

This is the only country you have. It is the country of your father. The country your children will inherit (the way it is, they will inherit rubble)…
They are robbing at certain locations. The police are ill-equipped. Constituted authorities are busy practising constituted corruption.

And all you have is YOU. You are all the Nigerian there is to solve this problem.

The question again is: What will you do?

Start thinking around those edges.
