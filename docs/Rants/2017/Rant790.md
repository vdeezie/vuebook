Nigerian friends will kill you faster than a bullet to your head. 

Or maybe as slow as drops of poison in your juice.

The average Nigerian friend is dumb, lazy, struggles with comprehension, struggles with sycophancy, loud, empty, corrupt, vile, struggles with delusions of glory.

I had to get rid of 99% of people around me at some point because even my narcissism couldn't deal with such hypocrisy. You need air. Especially with women. You need small doses of your Nigerian friends. They are clog in your brain. A mental disease. Sham.

So you excrete in church (aka you don shit for inside church)...

The typical friend is excited you did... but to douse that excitement, they come across as over zealous in your defence. It's a strategy to ensure that, in no way will she be described as jealous and/or happy about your predicament.

So back to your poop in church...

A Nigerian friend will first blame the architect for sketching the church. "Why did he sketch this place to make it look like a toilet? Nonsense architect. Shior!"

They will blame the pastor for preaching in a way that upset your stomach...

They'll blame the food you ate before you arrived church...

They'll blame traffic in the metropolis for aggravating your urge to poop...

They will blame the management of the church for arranging the church as it is.

They will call out the government, brand one of the ushers a witch.

Your Nigerian friends will blame everyone, everything... except you.

"That shit you did in church is God's fault," they'd say, "He should never have made it mandatory to worship on Sundays."

You would think some issues are lucid enough to judge itself... No, not until you hear the defense of the Nigerian friend... not because they love you, far from it.

Deep down they really don't care. And they really don't wish you well. At least not as well as they wish themselves.

It is why you must always apply your own head in your own situation. Always.

"Don't worry, you will build your own church and poop on the seats if you want," is the best advice that will come out of a Nigerian friend. 

"I don't know why they are complaining, your poop smells like perfume nah! Do they have perfumes that smell as good as your poop?"

And because we love sycophants, we nod our heads and wallow under the weight of their stupidity.

Nigerian friends are like the stories we read when we were little:

"There lived a girl who cleaned floors. One day she met a prince... he grabbed the mop from her, gave her a kiss...and she stopped cleaning floors ever again. She built her own home, and now she 's a landlady, no longer a floor cleaner. That will be your story IJN."

It would have been funny if it wasn't so tragic. 

Open the windows of your brain (and the church).  You need to air that shit more than you need friends full of hot air.

Two seconds later, everyone is back to living their own lives. But your friends have destroyed you in more ways than one. 

They pop in once in a while to gauge your destruction... and praise you for being a survivor.

They are never there to build the house, but always around to throw stones. 

In all your getting, get smart friends. One or two or three. Then breathe. Watch how they THINK. It is the greatest gift a friend can give- their ability to think. If you are lucky, their thoughts can be expressed in good sentences like Temidayo or Maureen... then you know you struck gold.
