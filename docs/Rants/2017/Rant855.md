I know many Nigerians don’t find this offensive - taking advantage of young girls in the guise of love and marriage proposals. In a sick society where many of your Nollywood movies preach to the victims to marry their rapists and abusers, this is quite a romantic post. He is “helping” our young girls by gathering as many men of his lowly status to marry them, based on the fact that N100 is enough to feed her hunger.

It is on this same platform, last week, that a mother wrote something just as awkward along these lines: “I don’t understand why the rate of divorce is so high. Just because he beats you once, don’t listen to people who advise you to leave."

This is a woman with children! I should unfriend her and rest from her constant nonsense.

So yes, this is how much value we place on our children, girls especially.

If you can feed her with N100, then you can wife her.

I spend up to half a million every term to see my children through school. 

The clothes on their backs, the food in their stomach, the funds for their entertainment and hobbies… there’s just never enough money even when we make a lot of it. Because we don’t compromise when it comes to caring for children.

I speak to only those who understand. Some of you are terrible parents anyways.

My girls have read over 250 books that have cost me close to a quarter of a million. I keep throwing in so much time and money into their future…

Somewhere in all of this, someone- A TEACHER – dares to disrespect our efforts as parents, by coaching men of his kind to talk to our children when they are set to sit for WASSCE.

It is why I do not think, in this present reality of debauchery, that lines of status and class should ever be crossed.

People are vile.

Here is a teacher who should protect our children. His job is a sensitive one. But he is on social media canvassing for young girls to be married off, as it benefits poor men like him.

Nigerian parents put their children in his care to teach and instruct. But what does the pig do – he is gauging the naiveté of girls on a scale of 1 to 100, and the benefit of their artlessness to his perverse ambitions.

Ask the fool about modern, unorthodox ways of learning; about introducing technology and building proper structures and facilities to meet up with first world academic benchmark, and watch him stutter in ignorance.

If you have children you love and truly care about, tell them there are boundaries in life – do not cross those boundaries. 

You are not under any obligation to be kind to an asshole. A teacher, an uncle or a security guard. No obligation at all.

Lord knows I don’t care about your sob stories. And I will teach my children not to bring themselves even a step lower to make anybody comfortable. It is in that place of “consideration” that many wrongs are recorded.

Tell your daughter, nobody should test you on a N500 meal ticket. It is disrespectful to her and to you- her parents.

I do not wish for any man to tell me he likes my daughter (when she finally grows to a full adult) because she is “considerate”, in this case to his wretched sense of importance, his disgraceful income and shallow dreams.

That will not be my daughter’s headache. She’ll be flying high and talking to men of her kind.

Why should we worry about our daughters impressing scoundrels like this Ifediata fellow?

I am upset. A new school term is here. We are paying money that paralyses our bank accounts, yet we come on Facebook and see morons parading as teachers scheming ways to marry our “naïve” daughters. 

Many Nigerian parents are constantly planning big for their children and finding ways they can meet (up) with the increasing rate of learning all over the world. 

Yet, here in Nigeria, we have to suffer these poor men who need to marry young girls by guesstimating how much they can spend on a hungry stomach.

You fucking loser. 

Our kids will be building aircrafts before you are able to drag out your calculator to determine how many young wives you can feed on a N500 budget.

Wretched ass.

If you are a parent and you do not find this Ifedi-whatever character demeaning and insulting to your children, then you are the problem of society.
