One of the "benefits" of patriarchy is in random encounters with the Police.

My tinted permit is taking longer than usual, so Patriarchy helps me through check points every time. 

How, you ask?

Watch...

"Madam, where your papers?"

I hand the policeman my papers. 

"Show me your fire extinguisher and extra tyre."

I open the booth. He inspects them like a crime scene.

"Madam, where's your tint permit?"

Now my hand is on my chest.

"Oh dear! What is that?"

He is not shocked at all. Infact he expects me to be clueless. He enjoys this cluelessness and is kind about it.

"Tint permit, madam. Your jeep has tinted glasses at the back. You suppose get permit."

"Ah! I did not know oh."

He smiles, kindly. Flipping through my documents, building conversation. 

"Your husband suppose get you tint permit."

"You are right. I will tell him."

"Wetin we go do nah? Tint permit is important."

"Sorry, sir. I don't know these things at all."

"I understand, madam."

"So you mean this back windows suppose get tint permit?"

"Yes, madam."

"Ehen?!" 

A wonderful expression on my face that satisfies him greatly.

"Even your fire extinguisher suppose dey inside that compartment."

"Which compartment?"

"Make I show you..."

And he educates me on how to use the fire extinguisher, where to place the caution sign etc. 

And I am nodding and holding on to my chest, totally in awe of this clever information. I whine a bit about a husband and how so busy he is to update me on these incredible car facts. Policeman and I gossip about this husband for a few seconds as he laughs and tells me not to be too angry with "oga".

After the chat that usually lasts approximately 8minutes, I show my gratitude.

No, I don't try to prove that I know what a tint permit is. I don't get offended that he tries to teach me basic stuff about my own car.

Mba. Patriarchy is willing to rock me like a puppy and I oblige. I allow policeman show off a little, educating me about how to set a caution sign and how to appeal to "oga" to do this and that...

Then I drive off into the sunrise.

Sorry oh, if it is a slight on this great gender equality pursuit. It is not with Nigerian Police that I will start to prove equality.

"How can you think I don't know what tint permit is? What bloody husband are you talking about? I don't need a man to teach me where to place my extinguisher? Please take me to the station like you would if I was a man. Talk to me like you would a man. Don't discriminate. I seek gender equality."

LMAO!!!

I wish you luck with that.

That was how my tyre case fell off at high speed on third mainland bridge the other day. Thankfully nobody was behind me, imagine how ghastly the accident would have been.

And there I was trying to reverse with one hundred cars speeding past. A frightful scene.

I thought I should alight from the car and run towards my case, but the speeding cars told me I would be cleared off the road, body scraped off the ground if I tried it.

Then I saw a police vehicle. They saw a lady in distress. One of them jumped out of the vehicle. I signalled at the tyre case far away from my reach. He sighed. I feigned tears.

He signalled to me not to worry, not to cry. I wiped my crocodile tears...

And like a true superhero, he ran through speeding cars, grabbed my case, ran back to my car, opened my booth, and told me to drive safely.

I blinked my appreciation. He smiled and ran to catch up with his crew.

What can I say?

I love the Police.
