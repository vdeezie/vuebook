There's that scene from Antar Laniyan's movie where Bimbo Akintola took a walk for all of 15 minutes without a word said, background music leading her to nowhere.

I kid you not. Chick just kept walking.

That walk lasted forever. It was obvious that it was meant to fill in time... probably not enough scenes to go round to make it a movie.

I went to the kitchen to grab a biscuit, she was still walking. I used the bathroom, she was still walking. Went to the corridor to get the laundry, still she walked.

The walk started from when she was as small as button on the screen, until she became a fullblown madam. She walked her way to a point where I could count the colours on her anakara dress.

I called the movie The Walk. Just because. I was in my late 20s, it was hailed an "anticipated movie". I died.

Then there was Osuofia and the hype. I watched it, and searched the entire room and the back of the TV for my sense of humour. 

Then Jenifa made me feel alone in this world. A movie loved by all, and the endless sizzling reviews. Ha! What is happening, am I normal? Do I need new pair of eyes?

Then in my old age, 30 days in Atlanta. Lord!

Now I understand, it's not them, it's me. 

I can't do slapstick screenplays. If you can't find the humour in regular words (and how I am able to weave them for the sake of wit) or expressions, then there's a problem oh.

I swear I can make you laugh, but not in that obvious manner with twisted faces, twisted languages, and deliberate, almost desperate, means. Mba.

I never laughed at Baba Suwe's jokes. Not ever.

I don't think Kevin Hart is funny. I think Trevor Noah is intelligent and witty.

I like humour that is seen not heard. Same way I feel about anguish and tragedy. I want to feel it.

One of my favourite scenes in a movie is in Contagion...

When Gywneth Paltrow dies and doctor tells her husband (Matt Damon).

"I'm sorry, she's dead."

"OK. Can I go talk to her?"

"She's dead."

Beat. 

"You mean like 'dead dead'? How?"

-Because all she had was a headache, and she only came to the hospital for checkup. Hubby waits for, say, 30 minutes and then a doctor is telling him she's dead.

His expression makes you laugh, then makes you sad. Then when you leave the cinema and drive home, you remember the scene in the shower and laugh again.

Priceless.
