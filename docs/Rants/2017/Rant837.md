Yesterday, in the middle of an office meeting, I got a call from an acquaintance. 

She went straight to her worries...

"I can't think of anyone else to call. I dey with man wey I nor love, crushing on another man. I used to be career driven, you know. Had my whole future ahead of me. Now I'm just lusting, afraid, and fighting temptation."

She spent close to 45 minutes on the phone. Unburdening. 

I was happy for her. Not for her endless lust and regrets, no. But for the power to confront her issues. To relieve herself of anxiety. To unbosom.

She chose me.

Now here's my point: whatever I decide to do with her demons, why should that be her fault? 

If I decide to share her demons amongst jobless twats, that foolishness is on me.

She's free. She's working towards her salvation. She took the first step. Getting it all out.

If I decide to be a jerk about it, then I'm the one with a problem.

If you go digging into people's shit, whose hands get soiled?

I suspect she didn't call for advice (I don't have any advice to give in these situations). She just wanted to get it off her chest. And I let her talk. And she did. And I envied the peace she must have felt afterwards.

The recipient's competence in these matters should remain ONLY the recipient's responsibility. 

So, my people, don't choke on your hurt. Talk about it. 

You may not be able to write your story or experience in a way that gives it breath... but you can talk, you can sing, you can scream.

Whatever you do, find your means of expression.

And if anybody wants to inherit your shit, by all means point them to the direction of the toilet where you dumped that loaf.

PS: Choose wisely whom you share your joy and pain with... but if you realise later that you shared with the wrong individual(s), take a deep breath, buy a new dress and move on with your life o jare! Toh.
