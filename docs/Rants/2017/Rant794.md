There's a lot going on in our country that is not represented and/or intepreted in our movies.

Kidnapping, fulani herdsmen and the thirst for blood, flagrant corruption, bad governance, children mortality rate as heartrending as 90 to 1,000 births, the corruption in PHCN, NNPC, State/Local governments, the waste of funds and alarming extorting in thousands of agencies...

These present and consistent woes are missing on big screen.

Our movie practitioners only want to make us laugh... and then fall in love.

Two things: Laugh, then fall in love.

Like the Americans. Except that Americans have told all types of stories. They have documented and captured all their experiences from racism to social bigotry to political treachery and machiavellian deals, drugs, cops, law, mafia... everything has been presented by the American entertainment industry to the American people. 

Here, what we have are "Wedding Party" and "10 days in Atlanta".

We laugh and laugh and belch and scratch, while teenage girls are kidnapped from schools. We talk about marriage and lust while people are slaughtered in Kaduna.

We watch #BBNaija while the economy is in ruins.

We are alienating the millenials from leadership positions. They are political neophytes and cannot comprehend or engage in worthy discussions on how to build a better nation beyond "respect your elders and involve God in all you do."

There's no future in Nigeria. The ones who should be prepared to change things are on reality TV, and the rest of us are waiting for the moment one of them will let their breasts run free from the straps of a bra.

We are expectant. The camera will zoom to a naked butt soon enough so we can masturbate.

That is our future.

If America was in this position of desperate economic crisis and political decrepitude; not forgeting religious falsehood... America would have done something about it. Through movies, through entertainment. 

We are still laughing at the cinemas. Movie practitioners will tell you that you deserve a break from Nigeria's woes. They will tell you, "you need a break".

You need respite despite the falling of a nation. Your country. The home of your children. 

We have been on a "break" for decades, yet it stands as the only thing we have done and we deserve.

A break.

I remember, as a child, the TV series: Mindbending by Lola Fani-Kayode. It was the era of debauchery and an introduction to drugs and blatant social waste and malfeasance...

And Lola used her talent to produce relevant skits that instructed Nigerians of the spiral that could occur when life is treated like a butt of a cigarette. 

Priority. 

We have zero priorities. Movie practitioners are defending the respite BBNaija brings. Because they need to bring out another silly movie where Ini Edo, the MD of a company, falls in love with Mike Ezuronye, the bricklayer. 

There are no documentaries on kidnapping, none focusing on the cost of rape, justice and social stigma in a country like Nigeria with ill-equipped Police.

We do not have a movie yet telling the disgraceful stories in IDP camp.

But we have three versions of Ayo's escapade in Atlanta, Jamaica and only-god-knows-where-next.

These movies are like the bone a thief throws to a dog so he can proceed to robbing the house.

Keep licking your bone.
