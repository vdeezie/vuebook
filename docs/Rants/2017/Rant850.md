Body shaming.

Here are a few ways you can shame a man:

You mock the size of his penis. 

You call him short.

You point to his potbelly.

You say he is effeminate. Mocking his gestures and gait.

You laugh at his bald (especially when it appears in his 30s)

You badger him to grow a six packs. Feet too large. Head too big. Nose too wide. Lips not kissable. 

Men are body-shamed everyday.

But we need to focus on women. How she feels when they call her "ugly". We always have to walk on eggshells when it comes to women and do solidarity on their behalf.

Just because she's ugly.

How about the broad waisted guy with short arms, big head and no neck... who fights for him, huh?

Women body-shame men more than we can accuse men of retaliating.

"Beard gang" is a thing. No man lacking beard has made any noise.

But when a few guys gloat over "light-skinnned women", madams black-and-proud-and-burriful with insecurities the size of Olumo rock will not let us hear word. They'll take offence and cloud our cyber existence with their angst and tears. Start a hashtag, badgering men to "love and respect real black women", with all their airbrushed pictures of all their horrible sides of blackness as a means to convince naysayers of their awesome beauty. Guilt tripping every black man for what a few want.

If you can't take it, don't give it in any measure. Women are not entitled to extra care and kindness. It's an equal world.

I could have just been a man. The gender of common sense and tranquility. 

So tired of all this double standard mixed with feminism and large doses of idiocy.
