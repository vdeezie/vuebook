There are specific days set to mark motherhood, womanhood, feminism.

There are one hundred and one causes dedicated to issues affecting women - fistula, rape, domestic violence, early marriage, breastfeeding, child birth, gender poverty, sexual assault, stereotyped career roles.

The lifestyle industry focuses on stereotyped female beauty, female body size, how to love a man, the home maker, the multi-tasker and other random premises for women. 

Organisations, niche groups and cliques exist; dedicated to female inclusion in every industry imaginable - from STEM to hairdressing, make-up, dentistry and carpentry. Or just faffing.

The most popular themes in movies, plays, poetry, fiction and many art forms discuss the plight of women.

Beauty products promise women forever youthfulness (sometimes they promise men big penises, but that's a story for another day).

At war and peace, the safety and sanity of the world is judged by the number of women (and children) killed or saved. Men are largely statistics.

YET it isn't enough. They say women are relegated. They demand more themes.

Women are themed out and thinned out with over-representation. But it is never enough, women still ask for more themes and more representation. 

How about painful menstruation? What about the beauty of my vagina? Growing old and grey as a woman nko? What about discrimination against dark-skinned black women? What about my hair - oh! I am not my hair... and on and on and on.

Hashtags are made to empower, delude or shame women.

In poetry, men are telling how they want to love women... but women are telling how they want to be loved by men.

This is how you build a gender of perpetual victims.

Always seeking representation. Always calling out for attention. Always needing empathy. Always seeking to be heard.

What about men?

Who listens to men? 

And boys, how odd it must be for a boy to see his sister aptly represented in the media through the voice of the world, yet it is assumed that he has it all figured out.

That is how you build a (male) gender of privileges. 

Women are victims. Men are privileged. 

We made it so. And I dare say, for the sake of our tea parties, we can't live any other way.

Women like being victims. It is the only life they understand.

To take that away from us is to rid us of oxygen.

What it seems we are clamouring for sometimes is not inclusion but outright replacement. If you want to be included in STEM or Art or any form required, go out there and demand it. Ignore society. Nobody will stop you. They may suggest you pause and "act a woman", but you do have a CHOICE not to accept.

If you really want to become, nobody can stop you.

Throwing banana peels at black sports men have not stopped black sports men from winning... why then should comments and rhetoric stop you from gender phenomenon?

Truth is, to stay a victim requires no brain work and little responsibility or accountability. It is always the fault of someone else or a biased system. It is too comfortable. Too convenient.

Focus on boys and men.

-Because after the chants of gender empowerment and a million gender themes and round-floor gender meetings... our daughters will go into the world to live, work and exist with men who are clueless, and never held one theme-d meeting to tell how the world should work.

Back to zero.

*PS: This is not an attempt to trivialise devastating gender issues. They need to be addressed. Yes.
