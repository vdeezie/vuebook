My electrician is a young and competent expert. 

My mother introduced him to me two years ago. Incredibly hardworking and reliable. 

When I was moving house, I employed his services, not only for the electricals but to supervise the plumber, carpenter, welder, bricklayer etc.

I'd leave my keys and he'd check on the jobs of the other artisans. 

One day I came back and my kitchen was squeaky clean.

I hired him to clean the tiles and toilet for extra pay. He did a great job.

During that period he'd run errands for my amala or jollof rice. We would eat and drink pulpy all day. Lol!

So one day laik dat nah, he decided to find out if I was lonely and would like to share my life with someone. 

(Don't panic, he wasn't proposing. By God, I'd slap him and pull out his tooth if he was. Lol!)

He was trying to hook me up with someone. Another customer he works for. 

A generous kind man, he said. 

I chuckled. I was amused. But I was also curious. 

So I told him not to bring anyone to my house. Let's meet at my Play, Wedding Blues, on Sunday. He wants to meet me? OK, buy my ticket. 

"And you must come with him, so I can dump him right on your laps and walk away if it is anything close to what I believe he'd look like."

At Freedom park, I went straight to the hall where my Play was staged.

When I looked down at the food court, I found my electrician... and a man.

I laughed tears and catarrh.

Habamana!

Courtesy led me to where he sat with this man he had picked for me. I couldn't help it, I chuckled this time. 

"Hallos, I'm Joy."

The man stood up like a soldier. Straight like a ruler.

"Good afuun,  I am Dee." He said it like a Nigerian child would recite some horrendous chorus.

I smiled. Poor dude. Of all the sane women he could be with, he let his electrician lead him to me... after showing off my pictures, and he getting all excited about meeting a "fine woman."

After five minutes, I excused myself and didn't return. 

An hour later, I am back to finding my electrician all alone.

"Where is your suitor?"

"He left, ma."

"See, if I slaaaaaap you ehn! How could you possibly do that to the poor man, introduce him to fire that burns."

"You are not fire, aunty. You are a nice woman."

"Shut up. Go and order nkwobi and eat."

I left him there for three hours. He had two pots of nkwobi, rice, chicken, coke and only God knows what.

This morning he called to say he has been stooling. 

"That's what a combination of nkwobi and aproko does to the stomach. Who told you I was searching for a man?"
