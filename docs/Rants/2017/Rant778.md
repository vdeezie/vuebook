Question:

What is the most critical mission of the Nigerian church?

What is the predominant chore of religion as practiced in third world and/or dark continents?

Answer:

Religion's principal mission is to enter your vagina and see what's going on in there.

Let politicians steal. Let Kaduna burn. Let emirs wed children. Let businesses crumble under the weight of recession. Let education moan on the tables of lecturers. Let the health sector serve as death traps. Let inflation kill the ordinary man...

Religion isn't bothered.

Pay your tithe... Then come here and tell us how you are fucking your husband. 

Are you sitting on top of him? Sin!

Are you drinking sperm? Sin! 

Are you taking a shower at night? Sin!

Are you having oral sex? Sinner, you!

Are you fucking anywhere else other than the bed? Sin!!!

Are you sexting instead of praying? Sin!

*

Let the world burn. Die in third-world disgrace...

But don't you dare let your private part out of our sight!

And the church says, "Amen"!
