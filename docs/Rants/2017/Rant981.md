My generator repairer calls me and asks if I'll like to eat "ugba".

I tell him I don't have time to eat. 

He says I should "try and be eating"
. 

"I say make I find out if you like Ugba, make I bring some come give you," he says.

"No jare. I nor send food like that. Na work full my head," I reply.

"Abeg try to dey eat," he adds.

I'm not even offended by the call. 

Maybe because he does it respectfully. He is not cunning; works diligently. There's dignity to his labour.

But when my mechanic calls me ten times a day just to "say hello", not having the common sense to know that I have the right not to pick his delusional calls, I get sick and lash out at him!

"Nor dey call me except I call you to repair my car. Dis na your last warning!!!" I screamed the last time he called whilst I was in a meeting. 
He calls me non-stop. What kind of delusion is that? 

That sorted. Now I am facing one retarded NEPA man and his silly gimmicks because I have to register my prepaid meter card number.

When he came to fix the meter, the fool leisurely walked into my bedroom where I was sitting on my bed with my laptop on my lap working on a script.

"Sistah, I say make I show you -"

"Get out of my room!"

He rushes out with that conspicuous stupidity of a moron on his face.

"If you enter this room again, I will kill."

"Ah sistah! I think say you dey busy that's why I say make I nor disturb you to stand up."

"I say I go kill you, stash your body for inside nylon if you enter my room again. Can you hear me?"

"Sorry, sistah."

"Sorry for yourself."

I just hope it has nothing to do with the Nollywood movies they watch on Galaxy TV, where the madam of the house sleeps with the gateman. That's TV make-believe. I won't even sleep with an educated, brilliant subordinate. 

A man (I am interested in) can be younger, but he has to be doing better than me. And there's nowhere in the equation of affection that an artisan features. I hate it when they try.

Not all dreams are valid, please.
