It happened really fast. 

I heard a sound, and I thought the car behind had kissed mine. On a normal day, I wouldn't pay attention to it. I don't come down for scratches. Okadas and tricycles are built for that purpose. How many crazies are you going to fight on your way to work everyday? 

After a year, you count all the scratches and do a bodywork... then you start the countdown for new scratches which will be taken care of by the end of another year. 

However if I hear the sound of a broken tail light, then I'll be out with all the fury I can gather.

I entered a pothole, so I wasn't sure if it was the sound from that experience or the car behind actually kissed mine for a second. 

And I did something I never do... I parked to inspect the car.

I parked by a corner for a second. The car behind didn't wait. I checked quickly and got back in.

I swear, it took just a few seconds and I was back on the road. And right in front of me... in just a split second, was an accident. The car was crushed by a trailer that had lost control. 

So crushed, it looked like a rumpled sheet. 

It was the car behind that I thought kissed mine.

Truth be told, it took my position on the road. We traded places because I alighted to check for any damage.

I couldn't believe it. 

One minute the Sienna was driving by, and the next minute... it's all scrap.

I couldn't bring myself to the think about anything except... What the fuck?!

I didn't allow myself to think long enough to be thankful or sad or confused.

I just decided not to think about it.

Today I remember my friend, Sylvester Barzini... (he is still the profile picture on Izedonmi Ilobekeme Precious Facebook. Yes, that's him).

And for the first time, after letting my mind wander to different calamities of the Nigerian state, I said out loud as I drove to the office...

"You are lucky to be dead, dear friend."

That was the only thing I said all day that comforted me. My radio show was such a drag. I left immediately it was over. I was in no mood... I put up a "bold face" all through. 

It was a really strange day.

PS: I trust my very smart friends not to thank God for sparing my car... with the knowledge that someone else's car was totally destroyed in its place.

Thank you.
