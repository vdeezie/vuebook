I have dated men who were disgruntled about their exes. Of course, we all have been many times.  
We would have conversation and they'd wear a frown or grumble about the relationships as they share their own understanding of what transpired in these situations. 

But I cannot recall ever dating a misogynist or a man with archaic cultural standing or a man who shames women in the last 5 years.

Maybe because I am willingly stuck to dating a particular tribe. And the truly enlightened men of that tribe are the nearest to civilised Caucasian men like George Clooney *coughs*. And if at all they have reservations about certain gender roles or issues, it is never a thing they throw at you to fix for their bloated good or ego. 

They simply let you live and accept you for who you are OR let you go and respect you for what you stand for.

Yes, in the last 5 years I have grown an acquired taste for men of a certain kind - good men, even if I say so myself. They are not perfect, but they are not losers looking for women whom they have to shame. 

If we start text flirting and I realise you are some kind of opinionated man in the affairs of women, I will kick you out of my chat life immediately.

The only rule to dating is: No Shaming.

It is not even a thing of caution or a conscious effort to do right. The men I know and have loved never have the right words to find if they need to bring a woman down... even when they are skilled in written words and creating beautiful sentences; they just will never stoop so low to describe a woman with certain sexual terms that includes her vagina.

I will die first than be with a man who shames women. It is beneath everything that is decent. It is public toilet living. It stinks. 

I have been at a bar or a restaurant or chilling in the lounge of a hotel or relaxing at the seaside... and I have heard men who mouth off to women beside them about other women that they call "useless" "smelling" "who she be?" "wetin she get?"

Stuff like that. 

The women laugh at this conversation. 

The only reason you and these neanderthals occupy the same space at a fancy hotel, where you are paying for luxury that promises peace so you can finish a screenplay, is because they have some kind of money that will never buy them class or commonsense. 

I have been on a date where the man I was with had to stand up, head to the manager of the restaurant to tell the man on the other table to pipe down on his misogyny as it is making his woman uncomfortable. 

The fool was making a call and was busy embellishing his anger with some of the worst derogatory terms I have ever heard. Slut-shaming reserved for pigs.

Thankfully, the manager was a white woman. She understood at once, and did something about it. 

The only thing superior to the misogyny of black men of certain tribes is the presence of a white woman who doesn't give a rat ass about your culture.

I have had to be on dates with friends whose boyfriends or husbands had very nasty things to say about celebrities. And they call it bants. Telling me I have no sense of humour. 

One particular guy went off about Tiwa Savage when her husband's scandal broke. There was nothing he didn't say about her. He talked about her vagina... how he imagined Don Jazzy would have fucked her. How Dr. Sid would have pressed her breasts...

He talked about her aging fast. Talked about "those tiny things she wears on stage showing black thighs". He said women like her will be fucking and cheating into their 60s. He spoke of her "upcoming menopause" and how he hopes it will slow her down... he talked about how wide her mouth is - perfect to give good head. He said she ruined Teebillz. He called her an easy lay.

This fool is dating a close acquaintance. I deleted both their numbers on my phone and never attended to their texts messages ever again. 

Bants, they call it. I call it zero sense.

A man should not be able to form those words in his head; how much more the indecency of spilling it out. It should be beneath him to bring out a woman's vagina - one you've never seen - just to talk shit. 

Phew!

I concluded he had an incurable, almost destructive, crush on Tiwa. The woman he will never have; best to shame her. 

I couldn't stand the sight of him after that encounter. 

Lowly creatures wank on that shit. When you shame a woman whose attention you will never get, probably to the rousing applause of your kind of crowd, it grows your penis an inch longer, expands the size, drips of wetness occurs, and a strong urge to force it through the hole of a needle.

That's the satisfaction.

I don't have any kind of these creatures around my space.

And if you are dating one of them...

How does faeces served in chinaware taste?
