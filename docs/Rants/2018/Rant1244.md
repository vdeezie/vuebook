# Rant1244


August 24, 2018

Tonight, as the kids tuck themselves in bed, they ask...

"Mummy, what makes you happy?"

Ah!

I can't do this alone, so I get a bar of Hershey's cream cookies.

I tell them...

"My art makes me happy. Which is actually the essence of my being. I love my job. I love what I do. I love my work space. I love creative corners. I love to work.

"My kids make me happy - two of you. I'm proud of you. And I'm glad we could do this together. I'm happy we could have a Dubai vacation.

"I'm in a relationship and it makes me very happy. It's a fairytale. All the stuff you must have read about Cinderella doesn't come close to what I experience being with this man, I can assure you.

"And Facebook makes me happy. The fact that I can purge myself of over 1,240 rants in the last four years has healed me in ways I can't explain."
.
.

They smile, "Ok, good night..."

PS: We had talked about what makes them happy earlier.

It's 11.30pm here.

Good night, people.
