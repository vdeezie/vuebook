There's this dude that sends prayers to my inbox every week. He's been at it for over three years.

I think it is mass produced. Maybe he sends it to everyone on his list.

But he is not even on my list, yet consistent with this project.

Many times I try to block him on messenger, but I am too amused to let it end. The sheer dedication to his craft.

On a few occasions, I have grunted an "Amen".

Not all his prayers are amusing.

Tonight he sent me one, and the intro made me chuckle.

"Every group of people that hold meeting in the night to destroy your life, God by your power scatter them by fire in Jesus' name..."

I am here thinking, why night? Don't they get to think about destroying lives during daytime? 

Does daytime witchcraft require a different prayer? What if these...err..."life destroyers" fall asleep and forget to "destory" these lives... if they wake up in the morning will the prayer still work against their "plans". 

Why night? Why not evening, say, 7pm? Why not midday when the sun is blazing?

Why night though? Why specifically pray to destroy the wicked ones that "hold meeting at night"? Do they not converge for destruction during the day? Or are they at work in offices at that hour?

Questions. Questions.

Should I recommend creative ideas and editing services to the e-prayer warrior? So his prayers are well polished.

I'll charge him a premium, of course, because the God he serves is rich.

He can pay.
