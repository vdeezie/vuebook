LMAO!!!

Something happened in the office this morning...

So we are holding auditions for another stageplay.

Dude walks in with his script, ready to perform the role given to him.

Dude is hot as fuck. 

"What role will you be playing?" I ask him...

But I am distracted by how goodlooking he is, so I turn to Roberta, my manager...

"What role did you give him?"

"The role of the random lout," she responds.

"WHAT?!!" the staff writer, Tosin, and I scream.

Sisters in da Lord, there is nothing random about this man. So why relegate him to randomness?

"Please excuse us," I tell the hottie.

When he leaves, Tosin and I pounce on Roberta oh!

"Roberta, what the fuck is wrong with you? How can you see a man this hot and give him the role of a random lout with only one scene?!"

"Errr..." she stutters.

"If that man mounts that stage and he doesn't come back for another scene, the women in that theatre will NEVER forgive us," I say

"What do we do?" She asks

"Give him lead role. If he can't pull it off, then he is not ready. Lead role or nothing. He doesn't fit in randomly anywhere in this script I wrote. He is a fine man," I say.

"He doesn't look fine to me. He is not my type," she says.

Tosin and I pause for a moment, waiting for Roberta's nose to grow longer. Then we laugh our asses out.

"Roberta, we don't care who your type is. Give him the fucking lead role." 😂😂😂

Write Culture staff wee not kee me! 🤣🤣🤣

We try to play down beauty in Art.

I'm sorry, but from where I stand, beauty IS Art.
