In our tradition of greatness...

Ife and Jolade came first position in their respective classes for mid-term examination.

Smart girls!

Now a random-as-hell question: How does my very smart and brilliant daughters fit into a Nigerian marriage?

How can they be reduced to home-makers and domestic lovers and submit to "wifely duties"?

How can they be told to be the neck of a man when they probably have the smarter brains? They are definitely going to be smarter than many "heads of the house" and their entire generation.

I'm just saying.

Why should society demand that they live out their "biological obligations" just because they have wombs. What if they have no interest in nursing or tending to children?

"Revisiting Matrimony/Monogamy/Motherhood" is a topic I would like to talk about... but y'all are not ready for truth.
.

Now let me go ask my beautiful girls to give me a list of whatever the heck they want to buy. They totally deserve to be rewarded.
