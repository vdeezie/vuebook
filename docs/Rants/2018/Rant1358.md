Tinder Update...

I found a Facebook friend on Tinder. 

I quickly clicked "nope" and fled.
.

I saw the 32 year old with the profile picture on an economy flight...

The 41 year old in a tired suit at a conference.

The 36 year old smoking shisha.

I saw Shakiru with matching attire at his traditional wedding with his bleached bride.

I saw the 37 year old at a construction site.

The 39 year old waking up from bed.

The 42 year old having dinner at Berlin.

The 34 year old in a Mercedes. 

The 32 year old in Ray ban.

The 36 year old on his mother's couch.

The 42 year old at the window of a New York hotel.

The 38 year old too close to his phone, I could see his skin needs moisturizer.

The 32 year old starched for an owambe wedding.

The 42 year old in a helicopter.

Nope. Nope. Nope.
.
.

Then I saw the 42 year old advertising practitioner... and I finally clicked "super like".

Only for Tinder to tell me I have run out of "super likes". And it will bill N3k for requesting more likes.

Bhet... bhet...

How could I have exhausted the likes I have not used at all? This is the first time I am attemtping to "super like" nah.

I kuku clicked "Nope" as fast as I could, and moved on.

Sorry handsome, I really did like you... but I'm not paying just to tell you that.

Tinder, why?!
