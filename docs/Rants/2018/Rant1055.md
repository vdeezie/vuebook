Planning towards one of his conferences, Martin Luther King had a reservation at a motel.

He knew he wasn't going to be allowed in but he went there anyways.

He got there and informed the receptionist that he had a reservation. 

The receptionist said, "I can see that, Dr. King, but we don't accept negroes."

So King went outside and sat at the entrance of the motel. 

The owner of the motel walked up to him, exasperated...

"What do you want?!" He asked King.

King looked at him and said...

"My dignity."

Good morning.
