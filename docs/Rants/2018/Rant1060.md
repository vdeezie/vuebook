Who pays on a date? Who pays on a first date? Who pays for lunch? Who pays on a last date? Who pays for transport fare? When should you split the bill? When should you order an extra ponmo? Yada yada yada!

How much will a cheap date cost?

2 meatpie -N500
Two bottles of Fanta - N300

Talk for 5 hours, sipping one bottle of Fanta till eternity. 

Total: N800

Buffet for two?

Are these the sums we are endlessly yapping about? 

Pay. Don't pay. Whatever. 

I sincerely will not go on a date and be making a fuss over wanting to pay. 

Years ago, I would do that - put my foot down and insist we split the bill. 

You know why?

Because I didn't have enough then. I had to project an air of financial independence. 

Now? I have nothing to prove. 

You should be glad I said yes to dinner sef. Pay. Don't pay. Means nothing to me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
