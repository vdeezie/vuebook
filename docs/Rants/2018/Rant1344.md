Warning: This rant is NOT funny oh.
.

So...

My boyfriend and I had a misunderstanding, and we didn't see eachother for a week.

I didn't know if he was in town or out. I carried on living my life. I'm sure he did same too.

-Because nobody owns anybody on this green earth.
.

So he came around a few days ago...

And I said, "I thought you were gone for good."

I wished I had a knitting kit and rocking chair, or maybe a nail file, to perfect my nonchalance ðŸ˜‚

"Gone for good, huh? Are you, by any chance, comparing me to average cowardly Nigerian men? Don't put my name on that list," he scoffed.

Wow!!! My jaw dropped. 

Then he moved to the door of my bathroom...

"Can I use your bathroom?" He asked.

"Do you need permission?" 

"Oh yes, I do. Your bathroom is like your private part. Nobody enters your vagina."

ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

Then he screamed comically, pointing to the ceiling...

"Oh look! Cobwebs! You have cobwebs, Joy." 

Da fuck!!!

He went away for a week and came back savage.

I will never forgive him for this shade.

Never!
