"Hello."

"Hello."

"Am I on to Joy Bewaji?"

"Yes?"

"Ok. My name is XXX. I met you at XX two years ago."

"Yes?"

"I don't know if you remember."

"I don't."

"Ok. We have one mutual friend on Facebook. Actually we have two mutual friends - A and Z."

"Yes?"

"So how have you been?"

"Good."

"And how is work and life?"

"Is there a specific reason you are calling?"

"Not at all. I just wanted to say hi. And maybe you can save my number."

"Ok?"

"So, how is your day going -"

I cut the line.

I know this might sound sexist, but I have certain expectations of any man that comes anywhere near my personal space or private/cyber corner.

Don't make calls that have no purpose. Don't interrupt the flow of my day and the rhythm of my life.

There's no time in this world for random average uninspiring small talk with strangers that hold no chutzpah.

No time.#Rant1303
