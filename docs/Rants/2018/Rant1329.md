LMAO!!!

So I told Roberta (that) I have found a muse for my stageplays.

Roberta said, "I hope it is not a full-blown crush, because we are too busy for that. We don't have time. Don't worry, your feelings will die."

WTF! 😂😂😂

And Tosin, my staff writer, nodded in agreement.

I have created little monsters at Write Culture 😂😂😂

It's a muse, not a crush.

He inspires me to write.

I wrote a script in just one day because he was in my head all day - my muse.

A muse is a source of inspiration for a creative artist. They lead you to greatness, which they may be unaware of.

I have had a few muses over the years, and anytime I find one, I become a genius of sort. I write more, I write amazing dialogues... my skin glows, my smile broadens, my heart beats twice as fast.

It's beautiful, I tell you!

Without a muse, I'll sit on a script for one month, suffering chronic writer's block.

I have told these ladies of Write Culture to go find their own muse. This is important for every creative person.

You may eventually crush on a muse or you may not.

Kunle Remi was my muse for a while. He inspired me to write up to four brilliant screenplays... yet there were opportunities to meet him and I didn't take them, opportunities to chat with him and I didn't.

He's not a crush, he's only a muse. I don't want to see him or talk with him.

You'll have muses like that.

And you will also have muses who will rob you of sleep and occupy your mind half the time you are awake!

This is one of them. He led me to writing probably one of my best stageplays so far.

The Play is for December.

I'm excited to have some fire in my bones.

He may never know what he has done to me.

He doesn't have to. He is a muse.

PS: Ok, he asked me out on a casual date. Fuck it 😁
