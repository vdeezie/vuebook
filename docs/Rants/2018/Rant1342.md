I've been trying to say this for the longest minute...

I am not boss lady.

I do not want to own a conglomerate of serious businesses, talking about investments and transactions.

I just don't care. 

I don't want to be anybody's wife.

I don't want to be a Nigerian mother.

I don't want to cook.

I don't want to endure a bad relationship.

I don't care for friendships.

I don't want anyone to root for me.

I don't want bad sex.

I don't want to have a conversation on strict gender roles.

I don't care who is winning. I don't care who is not.

I don't want to come to your wedding.

I don't care to be part of anything.

I just don't care.
.
.
.
I care about a trip to Seychelles and staying in a fancy hotel with a man who makes me want to have sex every day.

I care about my art.

I care about my kids.

I care about love notes and romantic gifts and gestures.

That's it oh.

I am not here to prove anything to the world.

I have seen wealth through my father. Been there. Lived that life.

I have seen lack through a marriage.

I have embraced great contentment through my art.

I am complete.

I don't need any validation from anyone

I validate myself.

I validate the lust I feel. The love I want. The experiences I crave for. 

I want the orgasms I haven't had in a while.
 
I am woman all by myself.

I need no permission from society.

I need no definition from culture to tell me what my duties are as a Nigerian woman.

I Am.

Period.
