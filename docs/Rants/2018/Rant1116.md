Instagram makes everyone a celebrity like no other platform can possibly achieve.

The obvious narcissism of average celebrity doesnâ€™t allow much time or interest in discovering new ideas except it looks good on you â€“ new lip gloss, new dresses, new shoes, new weaves, new houses, new carsâ€¦ nothing that would require you shedding your skin to put on a cloak of something more profound than self. Say, a conversation on the world's last male white Rhino?

*crickets*

Instagram hardly cares for cerebral. The biggest stars on that platform have lips made broader by filter app, yapping about the most mundane crap that shocks me every time I listen â€“ not for its lack of content (which is apparent), but for the number of people actually loving this mess.

Itâ€™s a universe with no oxygen for me. But Iâ€™m the only one not breathing, as I can see everyone is alive and well over there. And pretty too.

Thereâ€™s not one ugly person on Instagram. Not one crucial conversation either.

So you scroll through your timeline and everyone is pretty tired, or pretty successful, pretty-heading-to-a-meeting, pretty-thanking-god-for-life, pretty married, pretty-praying-for-twins, pretty-out-with-new-deal, pretty-hanging-out-with-friends, pretty-having-coffee, pretty-waiting-on-jesus-for-what-is-promised.

Instagram is equivalent to moving from your posh bedroom, to your stylish wardrobe, to your grand carâ€¦ to a restaurant to have a day-out with your friends, talking about the nail polish you couldnâ€™t find in Nigeria, so you must hop on the next flight to Europe to get that damn polish.

Itâ€™s really about pretty pictures and some really tired conversations on nothing substantial. And there are people rooting for you mindlessly to continue being pointless or echoing their truest clichÃ©s.

Do you see how the likes grow? Put your face close to a wall with just a love emoji, and you get 9,000 likes in thirty seconds. WTF! ðŸ˜‚

It's Kardashian-esque lifestyle that is dizzying and clearly useless. I lose brain cells just looking at all those flawless beauties â€“ from beard gangs to stainless women.

Please tell me why I am the only one that cannot see the usefulness of this. Is it because I am broke? I'm a hater, arenâ€™t I?

Shoot.

Away from the pretty world of Instagram, Facebook is facing an ugly data scandal. Their shares fell 6.77% yesterday. The company has lost over $37billion in value over this data-use scandal. It is selling personal data, compromising its integrity. Itâ€™s a mess. I am not rooting for Zuckerberg, that algorithm dictator. Heâ€™ll be fine. He has WhatsApp and little-cutey Instagram to console himself if Facebook goes the way of myspace and other faded glories.

But we will not be alright â€“ mortals, like us, who love ranting and do not ever need to be judged by fashion and contour before our opinions are respected. 

If Facebook dies, then Iâ€™ll have to finally meet with a therapist.

These rants will not die inside of me.

Ehen.

*PS: This was breakfast this morning. Is it Instagram-worthy?
