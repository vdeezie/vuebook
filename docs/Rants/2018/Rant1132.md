I went to the school to pick Ife...

I met one of her teachers. When he was told I am the parent, he was so elated.

"Wow! Should I kneel? Should I bow? Your children are brilliant!"

Ah my chest! The joy of a mother!

When I walk into the school premises, the ambience is so full of love. A school with a soul, priceless! There's something about it that makes me want to cry.

For the first time in years, I feel safe when I walk into a school I PAY FOR,  and I am certain there are no whispers about who I am or what I write on my own private Facebook wall.

No matter what society does, I am unshaken. I will never blend in. My children, even though they couldn't understand why I had to move as fast as I did changing their school, I know they have a better understanding of the situation now, and are totally in awe of me.

I see it in their eyes.

Ife is soooo full of life like never before! Jolade has a peace that is so beautiful.

If my life doesn't inspire them to make smarter decisions and be in charge of their own existence, then nothing else will.

I have played my part.

And it's still a long road of rebellious examples I am living that will shock, amaze and liberate them.

I hope they learn.

They will learn.
