We are going to wake up in a world soon where men are relegated to the background so aggressively that their identities are lost, troubled, confused... and nobody gives a fuck. 

The world is preparing girls and women, and neglecting men (so much that a literary prize abroad gladly noted that no men were winners as a sign of women's liberation. Smh). These narratives are not only shocking but dangerous. 

The problem, as I have always said, is that boys will grow up with no counselling, no structure to fit in or work with, nobody genuinely looking out for them... yet would have to operate in a world with smarter girls, and build relationships with women who perform better in every form that it exposes the mediocrity of these men.

The sad part is, the girls will grow up to be women and will have no choice but to marry these men - boys who didn't really develop to become men; men who were not prepped (like the other gender) by a world totally uninterested in the mental, intellectual, spiritual growth of men.

A world obsessed with the "new woman", that it forgets she shares this space with another gender brewing with anger that cannot fully express itself except in dangerous ways.

In this sad reality, there'd be a small number of worthy men, and an entire country of women settling for less... or willing to share.
