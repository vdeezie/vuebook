When we were kids, my father made us breakfast every Sunday morning.

(Sometimes he will be smoking his cigar and making the breakfast ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤£)

The kitchen was his office on Sundays.

He would start as early as 7am. The aroma will drag us out of bed. 

After taking a shower, we would sit at the dining table stationed outdoor, on the second floor, with a lovely seaview, and we would wait for daddy to bring our breakfast to us.

We were four or five children present at any given Sunday.

I knew what omelette was at four. Lol!

Dad would make toast bread, baked beans, omelette, veggies, sweet corn, a slice of bacon, and a big fat pork sausage for every plate. With tea or custard on the side.

My older half-brothers would chuckle and say...

"This sausage looks like our thing inside our knickers. Only that this one is biggeeeer!"

Then they'd expand their hands.

I'd scrunch up my nose and scream...

"Daddy! They say that our sausage looks like their private parts!"

Dad will scream from the kitchen...

"What is wrong with you boys?!! Show that young lady some respect or I will deal with you!! Bloody nonsense!!!"

We were 6 and 8 year olds ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£
