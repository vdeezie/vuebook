Ah! I have window from work to share one of my love stories with my man.

So here goes...

Two weeks ago, I was spending yet another weekend at a hotel, alone. 

I'd forgotten one of my handbags at my place. Next day was Monday. I'd be going to work from the hotel. I needed my bag, but I wouldn't think of making that trip from VI to Lekki to pick my bag. I was cozied up in bed with a book already.

Boyfriend is at home in Ikoyi... I am thinking he can make some superman moves and help his woman.

"Please can you get one of my bags from my place? Pleeeeease?!"

I tell him to bring the one he bought for me.

He goes over to my place, looks at all my bags, then calls.

"Babe, I'm at your place. Looks like I bought all the bags oh. So which one do you want exactly?"

At this point, I am wondering... how can? Where are all the bags I bought with MY money! 

Then I recall the last time I bought a bag for myself was ages ago!

"Oh wow!" I responded.

"You need to give me a colour."

"The grey one, superman."

We laugh.

Then I ask him to bring my trainers... 

"The one you bought," I added.

He pauses again for effect, sighs for more effect, then says...

"Again, it looks like -"

"Nigga, just bring one of the trainers YOU BOUGHT."

We laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh into a beautiful future.

I love my love life at 41.

I love it. Love it. Love it.

I'm here for all of it! üòç‚ù§üòò

Ok! Back to work!
