If you can stay away from sex that first day after your period, you are a strong woman.

I have stayed away all my life. Because I like to rebel... even against the wishes of my hormones.

Celibacy is some kind of self-flagellation. It"s your own delicious pain, your little self-righteousness.
.

So your body is quivering... and your mind is telling the rest of your quivering flesh to control its raging self. 

"Why? Why would you need a man this desperately?" Mind says.

"It is the day after my period, you asshole!" your Body responds to your Mind.

"Well, you are not getting laid. Woman up!" says the Mind.

"Fuck you! You don't control me!" your Clits respond.

"Oh yes, I do!"

"Uuggh! I hate you!" your Nipples get really angry. It's been burning with sensation all day.

"Your needs are base. Elevate your mind!" Mind reacts.

"You are the Mind, you moron! Don't talk cerebral shit to us!" the Flesh screams.

"Little wonder you act like a raving beast," the Mind tilts its glasses.

"Fuck You!!! We want to get fuuuuucked!" your Body howls.

"Sshhh! I'm trying to read!" The Mind says.
.

And everything is quiet again.

Sigh.
