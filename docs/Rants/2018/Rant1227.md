I did tell y'all to wait for your female president/aspirants to open their mouths, didn't I?

This is just the beginning, wait for more Zee World scripts to make it to a political party.

Wait until Eunice finds a comfortable marital sport for the third time, and watch her remind us how she campaigns in the day but pounds eba at night to feed her husband...

As if the man suffers a debilitating disease.

That is how the Nigerian woman presents her man all the time.

Like a fucking imbecile.

Ever wonder why a wife subs the girlfriend of her husband... but excuses the man?

It is the inherent admission that a man is incapable of comprehension and figuring out life all on his own. He must have been seduced by a woman to ever be able to make a move.

Now take some toilet paper and clean the butt of your husband.

Sad sad Nigerian women.
.

The feminist revolution you seek will not come from a Nigerian woman, they are busy trying to bring one another down - except, of course, their goons (even that can be questioned, you know? These goons thing is a performance for us to watch. They hate one another).

The feminist revolution will come from a man - a privileged, thoroughly enlightened Nigerian man, who takes full responsibility for his actions.

He will not be on social media trading words with e-paupers.

Wait for it.
