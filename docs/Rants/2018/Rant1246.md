MI Abaga comes out with Art.

You say he is "forming". His market is not for Nigerians. Nobody will patronise him. It will not be successful.

What they really mean is...

Nigerians are too slow to appreciate anything other than shaku shaku.
.

When you read. When you flaunt intelligence. They say you are "forming". You are not being real.

What they really mean is...

Nigerians are not smart enough to love books. To read. To elevate reasoning. To embrace knowledge.

And as long as you are nothing like the rest, then you are being a hypocrite.

You will find these plebeians believing strongly in their opinions.

I come up with a Play - SATAN.

A coconut head on IG said, "Nobody will pay to see this."

Bitch, I sold 204 tickets already. AND IT'S NOT EVEN SEPTEMBER YET.

If you are going to remain sane and achieve anything in this country, you are going to relax with a glass of your favourite drink, sip slowly, listen to people talk...

Then trash everything they have to say and go do what you want to do.

People are so sure of their opinions. So sure of unresearched, unproven opinions they cook up in their sad, miserable lives.
.

Go and do great things and leave these Neanderthals to their perpetual averageness.
