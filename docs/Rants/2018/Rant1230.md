I interviewed 55 stage actors yesterday.

The odd talent, the real talent, and the no-talent came with their sparkling good manners.

I was entertained. I was amused. Five hours later, I was hungry.

Roberta got me doughnuts.

Veterans showed up every other hour. I sincerely didn't know what to do with them. I didn't tell them to audition, of course. 

So whenever Roberta cooed "there is a famous face in the crowd", I call the famous face into my office, offer them a seat and have a conversation.

Which wasn't fair. They were there for a role. I didn't think it was in my place to audition them though. And I do not have the money to pay or even negotiate fees with them. So I encouraged conversation instead and I got their numbers for the hour when I can say, "Yes, I can afford you".
.

Ten more actors showed up five hours later, yapping something about "an audition happening here". Roberta and I laughed. 

Late as fuck and feeling fly. I love artists. Lol!

Of course, they weren't auditioned!

I am trying to do something with my art. It's crazy. I hope it works out.
