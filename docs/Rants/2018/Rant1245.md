Second day in Dubai, touring the amusement parks and aqua adventures, I realised how very little of Dubai I had experienced the first time I came.

My first visit was, of course, with my boyfriend. And all we did was shop at expensive popular brand stores and eat at very exquisite fine dining restaurants.
.

So I called him just before I jumped on one of those terrifyingly exciting rollercoasters.

"Honey, you didn't tell me about the amusement parks in Dubai!!!" I said, laughing.

"Babe, we went there on your birthday in June, and all you wanted to do was shop. And I didn't have a problem with that," he laughed.

"Yes. But this is so much more fun than shopping! I have played with every single game at IMG, and I'll hop to Magic Planet for some more, then Wild Wadi!!!"

"That is so cool!" He laughed some more.

"We have to do this together. All of it! Even the jangolova horses!"

"Hahahhahahahaha! Yes we will."

"Wish me luck. I'm about to enter a ride that spins your intestines out of your mouth! Can you hear the screams?!"

"Yes, I can hear the screams."

"It's our turn next. I'll be screaming your name."

"Scream without any inhibitions, my darling. Scream my name all day long!"

I run into a corner for a moment's quiet.

"I want to do this with you," I smiled.

"Me too, babe. We will. I'm down for whatever."

PS: And the movies! I have to do Dubai movies with my man! I want to pop that caramel popcorn in his mouth, and kiss him so it crushes in mine too 😁
.

So I hopped on the ride and I saw death LIVE. I couldn't even remember anybody's name during the "ordeal". I screamed for God to save me! 😂😂😂

I could hear Ife screaming, "My life! My life!!" 😂😂😂
