My very unpopular opinion goes thus:

Love Myth:

"If he really loves you, he will marry you."

Err... nah!

Very selfish people get married for selfish reasons too. Marriage can be an attempt to curb poor self esteem or insecurity just as much as it can represent commitment and whatever else makes you sleep well at night.

Marriage can be a hoax. But that is another topic, and I am clearly not interested in sharing any opinion deeper than my sandwich on this.

Marriage is not the ultimate act of love. Any reasonable person in 2018 should know this. 

Giving is.

Giving of your very best - time, talent, money, ideas, soul, mind, heart, space.

If he or she really loves you, he or she will do all of these amazing/romantic things, yet give you the freedom of being single, available and ultimately making up your own mind whether to be constrained (or not) by legal documents and cultural encumberances.
.

PS: The difference between you and me (which implies the next random person who reads this and wants to tear out their oesophagus in rage) is that I allow myself think these uncomfortable and unconventional thoughts without fear or shame or desire for acceptability or likeability.

Capisce?
