IK Osakioduwa on a self-destruct mission. 

His constant misogyny makes it so easy for others to win at his own game.

After every event, whilst Ebuka enjoys the blessings of the (online) crowd in  massive proportions, IK is cussed out for yet another female-bashing/drooling exercise on a major platform!

It's incredible.

When you consider the fact that IK is exceptional but so fucking distracted by his own need to be sexist... you want to slap him, shake him and tell him to get it together!

You are better than this. You are better than many, actually. Better than everyone's MCM.

Yes, he is!

IK is eloquent, breezy. Heck! IK is so good as a compere/host that I can envisage him on a Trevor Noah's seat (he just needs to embrace new knowledge, read widely and position his brand a bit higher than pedestrian online approval and acceptability). 

IK can get your respect wearing a bland t-shirt and zero style. That is how much skill he's got.

His talent rolls out of his tongue and quenches your need like cold water on a hot day.

But no! He is always trying to talk some degrading nonsense about a video vixen or a random slay queen or a female celebrity or fellow compere in a bandage dress.

Why does he keep having such lazy opinions about women in the guise of humour?

Misogyny debases men. It reduces the quality of your brand.

Doesn't he have anyone in his life who can shake him up?

It's tiring, abeg.
