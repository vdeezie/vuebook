"Your children are very quiet," the hairdresser says.

"Yes. They internalise many things. They read widely. Books have taken them to places even adults who travel cannot fully articulate. They are little gods. And they have nothing to prove or say that they have not yet proven to themselves and to me. Their silence is a rare form of confidence and non-fuckery. I don't want loud children. So I silence them with the wisdom of books. They are quiet because they have read things bigger than themselves that they need their entire lives to process."

"Oh wow!"

And she continues styling my hair.

I'm not sure she gets it. But who cares? ðŸ˜‚
