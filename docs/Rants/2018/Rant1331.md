So my December stageplay has alot of fucks in it.

The first time they read the script, the actors, they were humbled by the number of "fucks" a woman could possibly insert in dialogues.

Lol!

And I discovered, during rehearsals, they always smothered the "fucks", as if extremely shy to let it be great.

Why, I wondered. These are thespians, for chrissake. Say the fucks as they should be said nah ðŸ˜‚

But I didn't say anything. I knew my day would come when I would let the "fucks" in my script reign victoriously.

So last week, one actor, getting into the vibe of the script, whilst rehearsing, said FUCK without fear or shame...

You know how you are driving fast on Nigerian roads thinking, for a minute, you are driving through first world expressroad... then you enter a pothole that reminds you where you are?

Yes. That was the kind of effect the "fuck" he said whilst reading his lines had.

I was happy, of course. Someone finally breathe life into one of the "fucks" I have carefully crafted into my script.

So happy was I that I told everyone to say fuck as many times as possible so they get comfortable with it.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

Exhilarating, I tell you 

I can't wait for December.

18+ of course.
