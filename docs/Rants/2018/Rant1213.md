I have English breakfast every other day.

Those are eggs in my plate, by the way - probably four, made to a perfect omelette. 

Would you like some?

The menu comes with two eggs. I ask that they make it four. And I just might not finish it. 

I don't know how much my English breakfast costs, I don't look at the bill.

I eat what I want and leave the rest. 

He hasn't lifted a hand yet to slap me for eating four eggs and wasting some.

He never will.

N.E.V.E.R

So while you are receiving slaps for daring to fry four eggs and waste two eggs (or whatever the fuck the story is about)...

Remember there is one woman called Joy that eats egg in peace.

Stop living like a dog. Stop dating poor, angry men. Eish.

One life. Do right by your choices. 

Class over everything.

Toh.
