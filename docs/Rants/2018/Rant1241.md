In Dubai, coins are important part of trade... relevant method of business exchange.

A coin is part of the day-to-day transaction in every sector.

But you will come on social media and be talking crap about "Nigeria's fast-growing economy".

Which bloody economy?!

An economy without coins!

My children are seeing coins in circulation for the first time... in another man's country.

They are witnessing 24/7 light for the first time (apart from the pretentious 24/7 electricity they enjoy when they visit me in hotels in Nigeria).

They are seeing a functional amusement park with too many options that leave them dizzy with excitement and spoilt for choice.

They are witnessing orderliness.

They see good roads, sophisticated transportation, impressive road network.

They see malls bigger and glossier than what they imagine could be humanly possible to achieve. 

And they will never fully comprehend how African leaders enrich their pockets and leave the entire continent in ruins.

It is my job to explain trailers on Oshodi all the way to Apapa expressway. It is my job to explain constant under-development shamelessly peddled as growth. 

And all I can do is sigh.
