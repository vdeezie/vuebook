We work in the same office. 

You are a subordinate (because I am always a boss... after The Boss). 

We both leave the company at different times.

Then you reach out to me and start asking me out.

Sigh.

Young man, you cannot handle this level of Art.

Think of me as Caviar.

That is way over your head.

Exactly.

Double sigh.

PS: This has happened too many times in my career than should be necessary. 

Triple sigh.
