Who are You?

Person A: I am king.

World people: Proud idiot. Carrying shoulder up. Get lost abeg. Burn. You are nothing.
.

Who are You?

Person B: I'm just an ordinary person. Just managing life oh. God help us all.

World people: Aww. So humble. God bless you. He will lift you up.
.

Real situations:

Person A wins at life regularly. 

World people; Well, he is trying but he should bring his shoulder down. No gain in pride. He will fall one day. Shior.
.
Person B steals at work. He is caught. He apologises blaming the devil for his crime.

World people: Forgive him nah. Nobody is perfect. At least he has apologised. God will lift him up. He is not proud. Country is hard. Don't judge.
.
.
.
Again, I feel sorry for those who live their lives according to World People. You have my utmost sympathy, you hear?

My best pastime is pissing on every stereotype "World People" represents.

If you want to live happy, fuck the world. Thank me later.
