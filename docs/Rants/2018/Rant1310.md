So I got lost trying to locate my next train ride, which was just amazing!

I feel like I have been baptized as a Londoner ðŸ˜‚

Anyway, I lost my way. Everything was so confusing. So many maps. Everything is electronic. Even buying my McDonald's was an electronic confusion... but I shamed my village people and conquered my burger and oreos icecream.

Yas!!!

So... I was lost, in some ways, looking for my next train.

I looked though all the white faces hurrying to their destinations, trying to spot someone who had a second to spare... I spotted a plus-size teenage girl sitting, waiitng for her train.
I asked her kindly for direction to my next stop - Paddington.

I could see from the electronic board that her train would arrive in 3 minutes. All I wanted was direction... but she followed me back into the train station to figure out the puzzle with me.

She is pale, freckled with braces (or a missing front tooth, I can't be so sure now)...

All the while she was looking through train maps, like John Nash trying to solve impossible mathematics, I wondered...

Is she happy? Is she being bullied in school? Has her heart been broken yet? Is she thinking of her life beyond friends and boys? Is she studying what she liked? Will she become a tech genius? Is her mother kind? Is she wasting her time on Instagram?

"Got it!" She smiled and traced my map to train platform.

She had helped me solve my train puzzle and directed me to the platform I should be waiting.
I couldn't help her with anything... so I gave a profuse thank you and she blushed.

I hope she didn't miss her train.

I hope her life is beautiful.

Picture: My burger and ice cream... after shopping at Oxford street for 4 hours.

Meanwhile... I LOVED OXFORD STREET!!! 

I bought the baddest winter coat from Selfridges.

I can't wait to rock it!#Rant1310
