I legit saw a rich man's wife celebrate the end of her business.

She ran a boutique. She failed at running a boutique even with all the money available at her whiskers. This same business Yoruba women are running successfully in Balogun market in tiny crowded spaces facing the stinkiest gutters.

Rich man's wife threw a party to close her very fancy shop.

LMAO!

As in... people showed up to eat rice, and a pastor was called to pray for the successful closure of the business.

Money that makes people think like idiots.

You fail at something. Your mates are succeeding at this same business under very harsh conditions. It is not enough shame that you cannot run a business even with money you don't have to work for, but you fail at it and call a party to celebrate failure.

I don't... I can't...

Help me understand.
