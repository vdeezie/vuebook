Naija blog: 
Doctor marries illiterate man with no job or ambition. They met at a cement shop. He was sitting down doing absolutely nothing. But he wasn't afraid to approach her. With his bad English, he asked her out. The doctor noticed that he was a handsome man and also confident. She was ready to be humble and accept this man. She taught him how to start small business and earn something. She didn't use her career to do superiority with him. She was very humble and allow him to take the shine at all times. Now they are married with 3 kids, and live happily ever after.

Naija man: 
Hope other women can learn from this. You may miss your destiny if you are not humble like this doctor. You will just be single for nothing while good women are getting married and starting a family. Humble yourself. Bring down your standard, and don't have "tear eye" for worldly things.
