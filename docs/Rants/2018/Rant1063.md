There was that movie with Resse Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg, in love.

They went on a spin ride at an amusement park. 

As the ride was about to get crazy and wild, he slipped his hand in her skirt...

When the ride began its crescendo, Resse was also about to experience something earth-shattering.

She screamed, like everyone else, just at the moment the ride went absolutely nuts with drunken ecstasy.  

Hers was obviously made of more substance than others. 

She orgasm-ed. 

At that moment - 6 seconds long - she was the luckiest girl in the world.#Rant1063
