We are looking through the window in our hotel room - a wall-to-wall wonder.

The view is exquisite.

"Dubai is beautiful, isn't it?" I smile

"It is," Ife responds.

"Can you believe it is not qualified as a first world country?" I say.

"Why?" Jolly asks.

"The West is jealous," I hiss.

"Hmm. Is Dubai a democracy?" Ife asks.

"No. It is a monarchy, but -"

"That should be the reason it is not classified as a first world country," she says.

My Ife! Whew!

This is not conlcusive, this stance. I am not trying to verify her statement. Google is there to help anyone's confusion. She is 13... and speaks from her own understanding, which I think is rich (if I say so myself ðŸ˜Š). It is her confidence... it is that sense of knowing that makes me proud. 

It is all the years investing in their mind that is my daily reward.

Get it?

Exposing your children to books should be intentional. It is a very expensive venture... But better be broke than dumb.

We bought our first batch of books on this trip today. 

I know they will read everything before the week runs out.

I'll have to buy a truckload of books to bring back home.

Deliberate Parenting should always be a trend... and a lifestyle.

Join in.
