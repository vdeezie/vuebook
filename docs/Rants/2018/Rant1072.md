If you need to employ scriptwriters in Nigeira... don't!

Hire content writers instead, which generally stands for writers who write every other thing... then turn those ones into scriptwriters. 

Scriptwriters are not writers, per se. They are... I don't know what they are, but if we review scripts in Nollywood, then we can conclude that the use of Final Draft or Celtx does not a scriptwriter make.

There's a dearth of imagination and creativity. You use final draft, but can you build five characters in a movie script and give them personalities that are consistent, intriguing and believable? 

No you can't, but you use Celtx. Employing anyone based on the use of Final Draft or Celtx is just lame.

Heck, write your scripts on tissue paper, I don't care... just be able to break through tired dialogues and plebiean scenes.

I have more faith in content writers. I could have them and make them good scriptwriters, because the elements are already present - they can write and they have a good idea what imagination is.

Many people prowling the scene claiming to be scriptwriters, woke up one morning, paid for final draft app, and decided it was time to go get a job.

It doesn't work that way.

Employ the content writer instead. There's hope there.
