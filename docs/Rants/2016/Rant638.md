The archetypal Nigerian woman is a daughter from a prayerful home- a selfish cocoon where people pray that herdsmen-can-kill-all-of-Nigeria-but-will-not-get-to-my-domot...

She knows a little about every small business- makeup (how to perfect the eyebrow), tailoring (how to stitch the seams of a dress), bartending (how to steady a tray with a thumb and the ring finger)

She may be out of money 24 times out of 30 days in a month; she may be holding on to the the edges of a lousy relationship with a man just as unremarkable as she is...

She may not know the career path to take and understand what priorities should matter...

She may be cliquing to her detriment, and living an almost beggarly life- soul and mind lacking nutrition...

She might spend too much time thinking of a man instead of planning her own damn life...

BUT nobody can tell me that her first response to dissatisfaction is Prostitution. 

Stop insulting an entire gender with that crap.

For the classic girl in this country, she moves from being broke, to a prayer session with her family, then special session with a pastor. 

Then she finds solace in sex with a boyfriend who is broke anyways. She searches for words that are yet to be formed in the heart...or have not made that transition from testicle to brain. Even if it's a lie, anything that can make her feel good about her not-so-good self.

Then she starts to beg. It's our culture. Begging. 

Daddy could send her to an uncle for help. He is rich. Someone who can get her a job as a receptionist after studying business administration for 7 years in a state university. 

She may sleep with uncle, but that is not prostitution. That's desperation. No money is involved. Transport fare, perhaps. Or something just as insulting.

She doesn't get the job. A few more pleas with uncles and aunts and frontrow members of a church... and some day she tires from the search and...

A. Starts a small business that would require a capital of N25,000 or less.

B. Works for her mother's wicked sister- the one she swore never to work for.

C. Gets married to quickly shield her from protuberant failure.

Nowhere does sexual rascality or profligacy happen. 

It is still a small number fucking for money. 

And that small number are girls who just need a little more.

Greed.

Poor women find work. 

So don't EVER respond to a woman's lack with that tacky insinuation of "saving her from prostitution".

Don't encourage silly headlines that place prostitution next to artisanry.

E.g: "Instead of being a prostitute, I chose carpentry"

What kind of insane headline is that?

Is Prostitution directly linked to craft? Or the lack thereof?

Prostitution is not on the top ten list of what Nigerian girls think of when they have no money. 

Give them a broke negro and a marriage proposal, and they will live that broke life like it's golden. 

We know the flaws of our women... prostitution is not one of them.

Funny because the headlines are usually carved by women who think themselves to be better than the stock.

Empower a woman if you want to...but don't flatter yourself that you just saved her from prostitution. 

Whatever the heck that means.
