Oh did I forget to share this story?

Of our trip to Apapa Amusement park...

When I almost caused my daughter, Ife, great embarrassment.

Lol!

There I met three sisters. Two of them believed they were beautiful.

(They weren't)

The third one believed she was ugly. 

(She wasn't)

She was fat, dark. And she had a short weave.

Her sisters were lighter. Weaves riding to their buttocks. Attitude scraped from a gutter.

One of the evil sisters was demure about her position in the world.

The other was brash and constantly needed to show her superiority with her "beauty" as stepping stone. 

Since there were no worshippers in sight. No redcarpet to spread on the floor to lead her through the park..

She picked on her "ugly" sister.

She was constantly rude and condescending.

And unfortunately I had to watch that because my kids were set for the same ride.

The "ugly" sister couldn't ride with them. They said she was too fat. She would break the chains.

And they laughed. The "ugly" sister laughed too. Even louder.

They tossed the phone to her.

"Take pictures!"

A minute later...

"Are you stupid? Take pictures nah!" One of the "beautiful" ones yelled at her.

She smiled and laughed.

That smile.

I watched in pain. 

My daughter looked at me even as the whirl got faster and she shook her head.

No, mummy. She mouthed. 

"You are talking nonsense there, I am sure," arrogant "beautiful" sister rebuked her for chatting with one of the Amusement Park workers.

I went to the ugly sister as the ride got even faster and her "beautiful" sisters were lost in it.

"Why does she talk to you like that?"

She looked at me for a minute and I saw that sadness in her eyes. But she was quick to laugh it off. Wiped her nose and held on to the phone to take more pictures. 

"It's fine," she said. "Thank you."

"No it is NOT fine. Tell her to stop talking to you like that. Can you do that?"

She laughed even louder.

"Why are you not riding with them anyway?"

She shrugged.

Now I knew she wanted me to leave her alone...before, maybe, tears give way. Or she allows herself think of the many demeaning episodes i am certain she has suffered long enough to begin to despise them.

But I wasn't done. When the whirl trip was over, I took quiet steps to where one of her "beautiful" sister was.

I swear, I was just going to have a simple chat with her oh. No fight. 

Then I felt a tiny hand on my wrist...

"No, mummy. Not today. Leave them alone. Let them hate each other. I just want to have fun and go home. Leave them alone," Ife said.

"Yes oh! No AKTIVIZM  today please!" Jolade mocked. 

So I retreated.

And pretended for the rest of our stay that it was ok to watch a girl, barely 19, made to feel inadequate by her 22 (or so) year old sisters.

Life's tough.
