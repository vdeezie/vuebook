If you reach out to someone to ask that a hatchet be buried...

You need to allow the person accept there was a hatchet in the first place...

You also need to drop your message and move on.

The idea that you want reconciliation yet want to determine how the recipient should respond and when this reconciliation should take place is not only disrespectful, it is manipulative. 

I don't respond well to these methods. 

You have said your own. That is enough. Allow me to ignore or respond.

Don't come back demanding a response and leaving "hmmms" all over my private lines.

These things are annoying. 

There are people you stop talking to. No major fights. They just don't fit into the bigger picture of what you stand for.

If you have not noticed in your own daily living, I have...

Small people take too much space, ask for too much attention, cause too many distractions from the major milestones you need to reach.

I think we overestimate our importance.

When people talk about doing others a favour by not clicking the unfollow or friend button just so they don't feel hurt, I laugh. 

Who do we really think we are to think that people care about follow/friendship buttons?

My goodness! You are one sneeze away from death.

One handshake away from paralysis.

Get over yourself!

When I woke up this morning, I wasn't thinking about a follow button...

I called my kids to see if they slept well. Called my producer to know if he can squeeze through the marathon gridlock to produce Barbara's debut show on http://radio.happenings.com.ng 

And finally I responded to a mail from a client. 

We don't have time to glorify friendships and pettiness.

It's the same approach we should have with love relationships...

We waste too much time fucking and loving the wrong people. Wrong in the sense that on a scale of real value, that relationship is watery beans.

And those type relationships are the ones that have the nerve to be dramatic and needy. 

We can do so much better. 

I told someone last week, someone I totally love as a friend- a friend I am willing to invest time and everything into. She is probably one of the women with the biggest hearts and most sincere kindness...

But I told her if she has to make me work for this friendship, then I'll gladly count it as one of the unfortunate losses I'd have to live with. 

Because I am not interested in proving myself to anyone. 

If you are surrounded by people who do-not-like-Joy...you either get to know me OR can bloody well stick to your crew of lamentators. 

The dahling called immediately to talk it out.

Period. 

If you come into my inbox after a few years asking for buried hatchets... 

Allow me to care about it enough to give it any attention. 

And if I don't, what does it matter?

Who the hell is Joy, anyway? 

Go ahead and live your life.

The only thing I care about now, especially with women, is WINNING.

Your get-together selfies and your group of wailers... I don't hate them, I just don't care about them.

I don't care about alot of things.

I really wish I did. But I don't. 

And I wish you all the best regardless of the fact that I don't feel the need to respond to your hatchet messages.
