I was hoping Tolu Ogunlesi wouldn't turn out this way. It seems he is the one in a bubble. This reminds me of that drivel from Bayo Onanuga. 

All over the world, this is what middle-class worry about- the ability to use their "MasterCards" and yes, travel expenses and opportunities. 

We all cannot worry about daily food. That would be mad.

Middle class may "complain" over the rise of a bag of rice, but they can still afford to eat at fancy restaurants. 

School fees may be nerve-racking, but they still pay. Home rents may be frightening, but they are still going to work hard enough to keep their Lekki apartments. They do this to keep their sanity intact. To be able to feel the hair on their skin. Is that a crime? They worked for their money!

Middle-class will get up and try again when the state government destroys their shops and offices without advance warning. 

They will gather their funds and get loans to start all over again.

It is what middle-class people do. It is in their place to worry about vacation and MasterCard, yes.

How can that possibly be a crime or something to criticise?

Why do we always blame the middle-class for not being poor enough?

Journalists who manage to find themselves in government or hobnobbing with power should stop appreciating or criticising Nigeria based on the middle-class.

These people just want to survive despite all odds. Do you know what a trip to Manhattan can do to social depression?

Heck! I think about vacation all the time. I am on a broom every night flying to NYC to get some air. Even when I hear my neighbours prayers, I still don't open my eyes. And I am not middle-class enough... yet this is my worry. 

And I worry about not finding cocopops for my kids for a full four months in any shop!

How does that translate to being apathetic to the many Nigeria woes of pepertual lack and failure?

Every nation protects its middle class... but Nigeria attacks them and uses them as a pivotal chart of what is wrong with the country. 

It is your President and all the baby boomer leaders we have had and their young cousins and aides that are wrong with this country.

This regime is a sport for blame-game. The President blames all "ex-presidents" especially his predecessor...

And his aides are busy blaming middle-class for daring to want what all other bourgeoisie in every nation wants.

Turn to Buhari and tell him to ensure that the middle-class never worry about anything except MasterCards and vacations.

Then turn his head to the other side where Nigeria lacks everything and has given nothing to its people, and tell him to stop passing that blame around.

Let poor people worry about three square meals. Let lower middle-class worry about pay cheque ever meeting demand...

Let middle-class worry about ticket to Chicago.

Abeg! This country annoys me.

One last thing... we forget that all the gofundme accounts for sick Nigerians to travel abroad for treatment are pioneered and sustained by the middle-class.. and the many poor children heading to school with leather shoes and bags and books are sponsored by the middle-class.

The middle-class is the government (that) we do not have.

Yet they can't worry about sex on the beach and MasterCards.without government boys poking them?

Please!
