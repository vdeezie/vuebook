The only resolution you may need to make as a parent in 2017... 

Above academic excellence, let's focus on the self-esteem and confidence of our children - boys and girls...

So we do not continue to deal with this "Nigerian female woe" like a broken record...

Where the mistress beats and stabs the wife. Tells her she is "bad ass" (*roll eyes*). Strips wife, videos her naked body etc etc. Plus many other things I can't be bothered to care about.

Actions championed and/or ignored by a husband.

All the while these women looking like they need to care for their health and body and skin and hair and eyes and nails and trailer load of education for the mind and soul.

One of them confesses to high blood pressure. Both on the verge of obesity (yes, I said it!).

Too much love they deny themselves... because they need to love a man.

One random nobody of a husband on one hand, and a fuckboy boyfriend on the other.

The man is vindicated. He was voodoo-ed. Not his fault. Penis cannot be blamed or helped. 

The wife is asking the husband if he lied about his marital status. He is already being pampered back into matrimony. The next minute, she will carry her broken bones to the kitchen to cook his meal. He will remain unrepentant. 

So police is searching for the mistress, but prick of the house is not guilty of any crime. All his actions are what is expected of the head of a house and the baby of any drama.

I am tired. 

Train your children, whilst they are young, to have fullblown almost arrogant faith and dependence on self...

That nothing should be more important than self-preservation.

That his/her first god of worship is his/her mind and soul and body...

Before they get wrapped up in a decrepit society of ruined esteem.

Save the children.

Most especially, save the girl child.
