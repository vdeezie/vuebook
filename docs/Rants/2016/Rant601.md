Let me tell you about my day.

I woke up by 5.30am. Staggered to the next room to wake up the kids for school.

It took me 5 seconds to bring myself to the present. 

Midterm break. Kids with grandma.

I get to sleep an extra 30minutes before getting set for work.

Back to bed. 

30 minutes later, I am calling the radio station.

Is the content producer there yet? Check.
Technical producer? Check.
Morning presenter? Check.

I click to Happenings Radio with my phone. Crisp music, like it could make a crunchy sound if it was edible. Bless.

Phone battery dying. 

Generator refuses to respond. Not in the mood to pull the smaller one (that one is hypertensive). I call the generator man.

I grab my laptop. Click to Happenings Radio. I call my kids on the phone. They want Archie comics. Ok. Good morning. Goodbye.

I am in the shower when the radio stops playing. It must be Naija internet issues.

Internet provider is the culprit, as usual. But this time it lasts too long, Over 20 minutes. Never happened before. Not in my one odd year here. 

I call office. Office is trying my other numbers.

Internet provider has cut us off.

Smoke is coming out of my ear. 

Still in the morning mental haze, I try to recall if payment was made to renew internet subscription last week.

Yes, it was. Phew! So what is the problem nah? 

Customer service isn’t picking.

Calls start coming in, mostly from outside Nigeria.

Ifeoma calls from South Africa. “I can’t seem to get the play button to play. What’s happening, Happenings?”

Jessie calls from London, “Please check your internet. The radio isn’t playing.”

Someone calls from somewhere, “Is Talk Nation on? I can’t get it here.”

Another person calls from an unknown location, “Are you giving out recharge cards today? Is the morning show on?”

30minutes later, we are back on.

It lasts for only a few hours.

It goes off again. 

Okechukwu Ofili, my guest, is here. 

Oh dear, what to do? Record the show and play later. Ok. (forgive me Ofili, I will play that interview over and over and over again. Thank God for cloud)

Internet comes back on. Phew!

Just when I am about to breathe… the broadcasting software starts with its own tantrum. Everything is hanging.

A harmattan-aggravated wall pad falls on my head. Just like that.

Now I am tired.  

We move to another software. But it can’t connect to cloud. We move back.

I am talking with the consultant on the phone. And all I want to do is strangle a chicken (no offence to vegetarians).

Now I have to get back-up internet from another internet company for days like these.

Someone suggested Swift, and I want to cry. 

No. I. Cannot. Deal. With. One. More. Shitty. Customer. Service. With. Big. Name. And. Zero. Performance.

Why is Nigeria like this?

I have to get another broadcasting software.

It is what business is like in Nigeria.

It is constant frustration. Constant torture.

Like walking in the dark with no clear direction where it will lead.

No structures mean you’d have to build them yourself. 

I finally exhale. Not because we sorted the issues out…But because my constant worry isn’t going to fix anything.

I buy lunch and feast like a king.

Nigeria will not kill my joy. I am taking this one day at a time.

I didn’t think I would have this now. So getting this far…I’m not going to let something as simple as software come between me and my peace. We’ve got a Macbook Pro. Next week, we are getting the iMac.

We’ve got a tight schedule. What more is there to do?

The rest of the work is to pray Nigeria does not continue to be a thorn in the flesh.

For now, I am going to console myself that these are stuff that can be fixed within the next 24hours.

Nobody died.

I am sorry we could not present our shows today. But there's music. Plenty of it. You can click to enjoy... www.radio.happenings.com.ng

I’m going home now to have a shower and read a book.

Tomorrow is another day to conquer Nigeria.
