Nigerians are always embarrazzed. 

Always.

Your ex steals phone at computer village... you are embarrazzed.

Your child divorces his/her spouse... you are embarrazzzed.

Your colleagues take turns in raping your 9 year old and 5 year old daughters... you tell the press you are disappointed and...well, embarrazzzzed. 

Your 3 year old spills his drink on his shorts at a restaurant... you scold him and warn him not to embarrazzzzz you.

Your boss tells you that your work is below average... you say this is embarazzzzzzing.

Rihanna wears bum shorts all the way in Los Angeles, away from your underdevelopment... you stay embarazzzzzzzed on her behalf. 

Your cousin speaks proper Nigerian English with his calabar accent... you are embarazzzzzzzzzed that he cannot roll his tongue like flour when he chats with a white man.

A woman shares her story of abuse... you send her an inbox message to tell her it will embarazzzzzzzzz her future. 

The irony of any Nigerian being embarazzed by anything!

The one that really gets my goat is when a relative commits suicide, and all the emotion you can muster is embarazzment.

A very selfish emotion. Always looking out for its own tattered ego.

Try other emotions...

Try being Devastated by rape. Become Overwhelmed by unfinished office chores. Be Inconsolable and seek justice when a child is raped. Be Terrified by the factors that push your loved ones to take their own lives. Be Appalled when people judge (wo)men who share their stories of abuse.

Be anything but embarrazzed.

"Oh! I was so embaraaaaaaazzzzzzzzed! He didn't recognise me when I attended his event."

Nigga, pleaze!
