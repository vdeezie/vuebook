I thought it'd be interesting to meet with a therapist before hitting forty.

Since I have never met with a professional therapist. 

My mum has heard too much of my angst. It would be fun to lay that burden on someone else.

So began my casual search for a therapist.

When an acquaintance made mention of someone, I asked for her number.

But before making that call, I decided to look her up on Facebook.

I see she is quite active on social media. And friends to all the "Women in Nigeria" who have passed her on to the next friend and to the next and the next and the next...

Bottom line, it's just another owambe gig of women who live to lick their own colour off their skin.

I burst out laughing to myself. 

What really was I expecting? 

This is just one fucking charade.

I'm suppose to trust someone who has all these cliquey women as friends... cliquey women who inherit their friends' enemies like a N45million loan to be paid back in bits?

I am supposed to trust a Nigerian woman because she says she is a Therapist?

Mba.

I will surrender my Google history to the Federal Government instead, expose all the porn I have been viewing.

Not Nigerian women. I will kill them one by one first.

I have kuku called my mother.

"Mum I need to get out of here. I am tired. I am fucking tired of doing anything except breathing."

After all, that's all I really wanted to say to a therapist.

My Facebook page still is my best therapy. 

If you have ever felt like breathing is all you need to do at a particular phase of your life (this is not for lazy ass people with no dreams)...then you are all the therapy I need biko.

Wherever you are, just nod. I will feel you in my spirit.
