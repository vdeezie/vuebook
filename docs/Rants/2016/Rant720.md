Should we have "Day of the boy child"? 

I don't even subscribe to days dedicated to the girl child.

Like Valentine's Day... if you need a day to express love to your mother or someone you admire, then there's a problem. 

It all seems very pretentious and patronising.

And I hate being patronised! I'll rather have a dentist pull out a tooth viciously from my gum!

It's the same way I feel about issues on women, where the world needs to address us as "our mothers, our daughters, our wives, our sisters".

By God! I am not your daughter, sister, mother or wife...

Would I be less of importance if I didn't have children? Pfff!

I am a human being unrelated to you by any title that requires male affiliation or social empathy. I am equal because I am equal.

My gender is not superior either. Jeez! They move too quickly from convincing women they are to submit, to a lofty role of superiority... all of which is just condescending!

Women are not special, they are not inferior or superior. They are equal to men. Period.

Don't upgrade or downgrade. 

Let's stick to that and all will be well.

There is absolutely nothing wrong dedicating a few hours to celebrating the girl child...

But when my daughters ask me why... I have to tell them it is a method to boost their self esteem... because boys are already privileged... abi? 

The easiest explanation, however, is happening right before us- Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

So amma tell my girls to look at the screen...

"You see that man interrupting that lady every minute? You see how flagrantly disrepectful he is? You see how he breaks? His outrageous and ignorant stance? Did you hear what he just said about grabbing women? Have you heard the countless racist comments he makes...

"If he was a woman, he won't be anywhere close to becoming the President of a village in Agbor how much more the United States...

"It is male privilege at work.

"Now, if the woman next to him was a man with her rich experience in politics and a bit of manipulation, it would be counted for good as qualities needed for the number one position...

"It is an insult to everything sensible that He stands on this platform with Her. But we bear this circus... because male privilege insists that men get away with almost everything that would have been used against them... if they were women."
