All these deaf and dumb custodians of Patriarchy. These women!

I did not say marriage is not good...

I had my girls in a marriage, is it not?

Hian.

And I plan to marry again. Have I not said that before?

Toh.

I said... DO NOT REDUCE THE VALUE OF THE GIRL CHILD TO A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE OR THE AMOUNT OF SALT SHE PUTS IN EGUSI SOUP FOR A MAN.

If you are not half the problem in society, how can that be hard to understand?

Marriage is not an accomplishment. Unless of course you are not accomplishing much, then by all means straddle that horse till it bleeds. 

Alot of women who achieve, would have achieved with or without a husband. 

Tiwa would have found someone else to believe in her and pay for her first music video. 

Olamide believes in Lil Kesh. It is to his credit (beyond one music video) that Lil Kesh is topping charts.

Did Olamide have to kiss or marry him for it to be possible?

Women applaud their husbands at every point of their success because this society will not let them be if they do not act like they are nothing without their men.

You have to act that role. That role that forces you to submit; that script that says...

"Beyond this success, I have a great man, I am a true African woman. I am not sleeping around to make this huge success. There's a man who allows me to be great. And I am grateful."

That's the script. And you all play it well.

The only woman, that I see, who doesn't give a fuck and completely owns her success is Mo Abudu.

She would thank her crew, thank God, and reserve some 'thank you' for her bad self.

That's confidence.

And that's exactly what I want for my daughters.

I want them to climb that platform and thank their bad selves for breaking boundaries. 

After your parents spend all that money on your education for close to two decades, you finally succeed...

Then when you want to give a shoutout, you start to act out Patriarchy's script... laying your success at the feet of a man you've married for just 5 years. 

Does that make any sense?

Please ehn, go and train your children to wash the feet of a husband. 

Leave me let me raise fellow rebels.

Iz it your rebel?

Toh.

PS: There are still men who do not want to feed off a woman's pride. They don't want that shit that makes you smaller than them. They are not giving you permission to succeed because they know it is not in their authority to do so. They acknowledge that you are an adult and your purpose is yours to fulfil. Helping out doesn't make them Lord over your life.

They are out there somewhere.
