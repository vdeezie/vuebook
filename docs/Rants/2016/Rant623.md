Gender sexual abuse is purely an intellectual concept...

Until it happens to YOU or someone you love.

So long as gender sexual abuse remains a random picture trending on social media...

It will be analysed by people stuffed in average homes, eating biscuits with coffee...who move from political discourse to Kim Kardashian's latest nude picture in minutes.

It is not yet important or even real if abuse is not happening at your doorstep. 

It is why you have women telling other women to SLAP a group of men when attacked. 

How?

How is this young lady supposed to spread that slap? Like butter spread on bread? Or like Jackie Chan?

Oh yes! Some have advised girls to learn karate.

Where?

How many do you see around your neighbourhood here in Nigeria? (Please don't drop one random karate school here like it is accessible to millions of women if we decide to enrol).

Are they as prevalent as churches and grocery stores?

And of course, we have those who think she shouldn't be smiling...

Why isn't she screaming?

Why isn't she punching?

Our only grasp of shock is when we roll in sand. Ashes on our heads. Wailing like idiots. Exaggeration at its finest. 

It is why a woman has to scream when her husband dies...else she would be observed as the killer.

We want exaggeration to excuse what society permits.

It annoys me even more when it's a woman dishing this shit out.

You want to tell another woman how to behave during and after rape?

With your bloody lousy data you turn sexual abuse to intellectual bargain from the the corner of your lips.

You are a disgrace, by the way.

You and women like Uwa on TVC Breakfast Show who spreads her ignorance on a couch on LIVE TV and announces over-and-again, in many ways, that sexual molestation allows for some form of consent.

Indeed, this lady asked for this. These men and women belch...

If not, why didn't she give the man grabbing her breast a slap?

#

I have been in speaking events where a co-speaker instructs girls to slap men or boys who molest them...

And when it is my hour to speak, I do not waste time in opposing that instruction. 

Do not slap a Nigerian man.

You will give him the full clearance to beat you, rape you and strangle you.

And society will understand. 

"Bhet...why did she slap him?" Will be the end of you.

And we will move on. Away from your death.

You hear me?

You are living in a patriarchal society.

Slapping is not the solution to molestation. Stop telling girls to hit men.

Unless she can match his strength. Then let her.

I know women who beat up their abusive partners and with that show of strength, they end the abuse in their homes/lives.

But those women are the exception. Women are not built with physical strength. 

What we need to do is seek justice.

If you try out the justice system in Nigeria for rape and assault...you will be confronting demons.

You can cast the demons to hell!

These molesters are cowards. When they see the numbers stack up against them... when some random person petitions the police...

We will be wiping off that smirk of privilege on the faces of men/boys who think it is ok to rape or sexually harrass a girl...because she didn't return a "hello".

So...if you have any information on these boys (especially that fucker grabbing her breast), holler.

I want to see what we can make of this in a court of law.

Thanks.
