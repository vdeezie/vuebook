When I was a church-goer, I spent the entire time fighting sexual temptation for the years I didn't have sex.

The energy we need to fight lust is the amount needed to create a car with 3D windshield...or a smartphone with built-in device that can test your blood and diagnose diseases.

You keep binding that natural sexual feeling until there's nothing more to do with your life.

Energy expended.

So your accomplishment at the end of, say, 10 years would be successfully fighting sexual urges.

In a world where science creates wireless electronic implants attached to the brain to detect ailments in the body before it happens...and where sunglasses are made to microwave your food...

Your sexual sobriety is quite the achievement.

Anyway, I decided not to be a church-goer anymore so I can have sex and lust over Usher...

And save my energy for other things that can change society.
