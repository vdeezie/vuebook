I wish I was a Caucasian male living in Toronto, with a job as a financial analyst, burgeouis lifestyle and the simple reality of knowing I am an entity. An individual. Complete. Without a need to be made whole by a hashtag...dating a white woman with freckles on her cheeks, with a degree in Psychology.

Something like that. 

Because this black life is just really annoying and distracting.

Chris Rock has a shot at standing as the host on the biggest stage in the entire world...

Yet people expect him to boycott The Oscars with other black folks.

Are you on crack? 

Chris Rock should leave the stage because madam Pinkett is upset her husband and Eazy E are not getting Oscar recognition. 

Will Smith is a good actor, no doubt. Not amazing. And definitely not a god.

Leonardo is king. He is a god.

He just so happens to be white. We can't blame him for being white. 

Next to The Revenant, Concussion is a thoughtful story of the greatness of a doctor. It has its place.

But The Revenant is world class Art.

People want Straight outta Compton to get Oscar nomination?

For what? The acting or the directing? Which part exactly so I can drown in my cup of tea.

Or we just want inclusion so badly anything will do? 

Soon, Tyler Perry will have a word on #Oscarsowhite...

Then I can finally hang myself.

As a race and institution, we are average. 

Black is utterly average.

I read a piece on programmers. When black students were sent to Silicon Valley, they met with white students who started programming as young as 7.

Black fathers don't have time for that. They have to cheat on their last babymama with the third babymama...only for the fifth babymama to get pregnant for the third time...

And he is only a cab man. 

We do have black exceptions, of course. However, the privileges we demand rest on sentiments and colour...

Just for the heck of being black, we think we deserve stuff.

I am not only black... I am black and female.

Double tragedy. 

The segregation within us is appalling.

One: Do you have natural hair OR a weave.

Two: Is your weave a cheap beehive OR of Brazilian quality?

Three: Are you a feminist OR anti-feminist?

Four: Are you a cliquey feminist OR an outlier forming tough shit?

Five: Are you light OR really dark?

Six: Do you align with #blackgirlrock OR are you just black for nothing?

Seven: Are you a Caucasian-dating black girl OR white men put you off?

Eight: Are you a pretty black girl like Beyonce OR pretty black girl like Viola Davis.

Nine: Will you support a group of black women's right to ask for more sex from their men OR you want to be pretending dat penis is not your problem?

Ten: Will you join the group of black sisters asking the world to love their blackness OR are you going to deny your own.

We go on and on and on...

Segregation within black women. A pointless war. Until there are no groups and causes left to form; until our backs are bent and the world leave us behind as we struggle with black zootomy...

And every black woman becomes a black dot on the face of the earth. Energy expended on trivialities.

Oscar so white my black ass.

May the best human being win for every opportunity life presents regardless of race or gender.
