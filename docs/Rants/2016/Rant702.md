Nobody ever stood on a platform, held an award plaque and grinned...

"I watched alot of TV, now here I am."

Never. 

Children don't need TV. They need books.

Let them read everything they need to watch.

Take out the TV plug, and plug in the bookshelf to illuminate the books.

Take down the TV and build a library instead. 

It is ridiculous to say that a parent is taking away their childhood because of a ban on TV.

It's the same way I was accused of taking away their childhood because I stopped them from going to church to be part of children church activities. 

Lol!

We need to sit down and shape the life we want for our kids.

Dumping children infront of the screen without monitoring the content is lazy parenting. 

I have monitored the content. I am tired of cringing. I need to take a stand.

Three days ago I went to get groceries and I noticed that the store had a book section. Naturally I went over to buy books for my kids...

My girls have too many story books and very little space. 

(They have read over 200 fiction. They are yet to understand why I keep buying books, but someday they will. But read, they must).

I handed them the books and told them to read all of Wednesday. 

"No TV when I'm at work, ok?"

They nodded. 

Yesterday morning, Ife was done with her book. She told me the story. 

Now she knows the story of Oliver Twist. 

Of course, they have some of these stories in movies... but DSTV isn't showing them.

All we have on Disney Channel and other drab kiddies channel on TV are...

Young-girls-looking-for-love... Young-girls-hoping-to-join-the-popular-gang-in-school... Young-girls-trying-to-get-a-boy-to-notice-them... Young-girls-hoping-to-become-the-best-singer-or-dancer-in-town... Young-girl-upset-that-she-isn't-as-pretty-as-the-cheerleader-in-basketball...

Uugh!

I see how white kids talk to their parents on TV without a speck of respect, banging doors and acting privileged. 

No nah.

That's lazy parenting if I let that slide thinking it wouldn't stick. 

Denying your children TV for one year is not "taking away their childhood", we are such drama queens in Nigeria.

If there's a good movie (like Frozen) showing at the cinemas, we shall march over there to watch it.

But no more daily witchcraft on how to fall in love when you are 10 years old!

Jeez!

If at all they have to learn this kinda crap...then they should READ not watch. That way they learn more vocabularies.

All of the writers whose works and sentences blow my mind always say...

"I read alot. I devoured my parent's library. There was very little else to do when they were at work. No TV. No light. So I read and read and read."

Reading is not so you can become a writer or author...when you hold conversation with a reading child- whether she turns out an engineer or architect, you will know that knowledge resides here.

That's the story that makes sense to me.
