Kpankere is a successful businessman.

Kpankere grew up in Oshodi where he sold adulterated bottles of perfume for his mother.

But he knew that one day he'd be rich...

So he would visit Banana Island every weekend.

Spend his last penny to observe the rich...because that is where he believed he should be *sic*.

Now he owns businesses all over Africa. At 23, he is the epitome of success in Nigeria. This was achieved through hardwork and dedication. 

He is worth over one billion euros and helps the needy.

He acquired a brand new jet last year and is very humble even in the midst of plenty.

This is how our media profile Nigerian billionaires.

It's the reason you cannot find proper biography or biopic on the wealthy (monetary success) in Nigeria. 

We have books on emotional, spiritual and career successes and wealth because...well...it is easy to wring pseudo virtues out of those themes.

But financial success would require FACTS. Solid facts. 

How. Did. You. Make. A. Billion. Dollars?

You can't faff around that. 

And so in a very corrupt society, what you'll get is sycophancy and brown-nosing techniques to the subject.

We all know how Zuckerberg and Jobs and Branson did it.

There are movies and books to show.

Who knows how these young lads are making $750million in our tough and depressing economy?

Don't tell me God.

Then you insult me.

If you represent a billionaire as a publicist...please get a script for the "HOW".

It is the only way your client can get true respect.

All other methods of noisemaking will only irritate us further.

PS: *he achieved this through hardwork and dedication* is the part I HATE the most (and then, of course, that shitty word- humble, in the Nigerian context).

What are we all doing? Aren't we just as hard at work and dedicated to our hustle and craft?

Nigeria insults me everyday.
