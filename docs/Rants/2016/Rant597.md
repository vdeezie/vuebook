Life is a bundle of emotions. 

I had a great day at work. Hosted a foreign investor and actually clicked the deal.

My team was happy. They congratulated me. Congratulated one another. We talked about buying big cars and taking trips to Mauritius.

We nailed it. Things will never be the same. And the feeling tastes so good.

There is plenty of work ahead to justify this big leap, but for the moment I just wanted to get home and be with my kids.

They wouldn't understand what it means to host a few French men and get a great deal for my company...

But they would, at least, feel my joy and it may send sunshine into their hearts even at night.

I hurried to my mother's place, picked my girls and hurried home.

I got them some fruits on the way home...the plan was to sit and let my joy spread across the room..

Until I asked my older daughter how her social studies presentation went.

She burst out crying. 

Her costume was wrong. Everyone laughed when she stepped out. And she got 6/10.

I felt like shit immediately.

She told me about the presentation a week ago. She was to get iro and buba.

She has one iro and buba. So I was just going to pull it out from under a chair or a wardrobe on D-day.

I was swamped with work and the idea of sewing a new one for a presentation didn't occur to me.

Today was D-day. In the morning, we searched everywhere for the iro and buba. Fail.

I don't have any of my own. So we decided she could take a dress made of local lace (like the ones made to sew iro and buba) for the presentation. And I gave her the necessary accessories.

But everyone else had very colourful ethnic appearance for the presentation. So when she walked in with a dress...

She was out of place.

And kids are mean.

They laughed. 

She held the tears for over 6 hours...and only just expressed her- dissapointment? anger? pain? shame?- when I asked how her day went.

I cried too.

Because I really hate to be the one standing in the way of a child's greatness.

For instance when children wake up by 5.30am every morning to prepare for school...

They have no business getting to class late.

I'd be damned to be that parent who drags her feet around the house until 8am!

I respect them enough to get my ass up and take them to shool by 7am. Bright and early. 

I am that parent who pays fees even before the two weeks deadline.

I run a system where my weaknesses do not rub off on my children.

So this, for me, is a big failure on my part.

I should have ensured the iro and buba was found before D-day. Ironed and ready to be worn.

Or make the time to sew one.

I work round the clock- holding down a career and a home. Trying to make sense of life.

I am usually too tired mentally for alot of things afterwards 

I told her to tell me exactly how she felt. Shout at me or cry some more if it would make her feel better. Anything.

I am sorry.

And she put her head on my shoulder and cried. 

It is tough being a single parent. 

Sometimes.
