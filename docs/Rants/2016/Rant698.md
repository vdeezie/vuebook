The comp√®re at Mark Zuckerberg's event in Lagos said...

"Ask smart questions. Do not embarrass me."

A joke. But quite an awkward moment. 

Trust Nigerians to laugh it off.

I don't understand how that should ever be funny though. 

It was not an open event with agberos in attendance, hungry for a meal...without a clue what the word "coding" represents.

These are tech engineers and entrepreneurs, digital marketers and social media pushers selected for this gig.

Let us try and not be so dissapointed in what people who already survive in a country that provides them absolutely no facility to succeed have to say... what they have to say is far more golden than what Zuckerberg can share.

Mark Zuckerberg said it himself: There's a part of LUCK that played in my life.

Oprah says the same thing everytime she climbs a rostrum.

Luck.

Call it favour, if you like. 

Grace, maybe.

Favour of being born in a privileged society that rewards your industry and vision...and protects your dignity... lifts you from poverty...and celebrates your unique gifts.

Nigerians are not stupid. 

We are just unlucky to have old wicked clueless baby boomers holding on to the reins.

Picture this: I am trying to convince my friend Vivian to launch a Web radio in Houston for diasporans. 

If she buys into the idea, Vivian will turn over ten times in her business before I dream of breaking even here in Nigeria. 

Why?

Vivian wouldn't have to worry about poor Internet service. If she pays for premium service, she will get premium service from her Internet provider.

She wouldn't need to buy a generator. So there's no diesel cost running into N45k weekly.

She wouldn't have to deal with corrupt tax officers requesting a bribe of N3million. 

She can conveniently run a 24 hour station with less operating cost and headache. 

Vivian will not have to deal with fake products. If she takes the dollar equivalent of N100k to the market to get extra Web radio needs...she will most likely be getting warranty on the products and be rest assured they are of good quality.

She can get a bank loan easily if she wants to expand the media business. Opportunities like that are almost nonexistent in Nigeria. 

Just by being in a privileged society, she is many steps ahead of me even before purchasing a soundcard!

That's the reality of succeeding in a first world as against pushing through a third world and all its "drudgery and broken dreams".

We are here on Facebook because America gave Zuckerberg, a student in higher learning, the right to dream and succeed.

It is what I wish for my children. 

Respect what we go through everyday in this shithole called Nigeria abeg.

To overcome our daily travails and still not be trusted to ask "cool questions" when necessary at an event is like beating a dead horse with an iron rod.
