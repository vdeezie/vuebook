Apparently, when rape happens and videotaped in Nigeria...

The sister of the rapist protects the phone...

The mother of the rapist protects her son, and then calls the victim over to apologise to her...

And life as we know it is supposed to carry on with roasted corn and laughter?

Wrong! 

I want to thank Evans Ufeli for the amazing work he does constantly on protecting the dignity of women, especially girls raised in the most uninspiring family setting...with the most presumptuous and ignorant of parents, romancing stark poverty... it makes you want to stomp on a demon.

We are going to court!

But I have to add this:

Justice is its own reward. It shouldn't turn a victim to a beggar. 

I do not support gofundme activism for every little tear. We need to teach young girls how to balance education and trade.

Justice is its own joyful reward.

When we can take a rapist to jail...

That is all the 'money' a victim needs.

If she requires more...let us direct her through the path to self-empowerment.

(Counselling and therapy will be offered, of course).

Remember: conscience is a waste of time. It's either we are educating these boys against rape...

Or we throw them in jail.

No time.
