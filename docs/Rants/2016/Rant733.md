The toughest part of a relationship is meeting the cultural and social expectations of the family and friends of your man. (God help you if there are religious expectations involved!!!)

-Because love between a man and and woman is never enough in Nigeria. 

As an outlier I am certain I will fail when I need to cross that bridge.

Sometimes I wish love between a man and a woman should be enough.

This idea that a woman should be liked by everyone is really pretentious. And it is why many Nigerian women are relationship frauds. 

It's a performance of sort. An acting role to perfect the smiles, hair, makeup and social interests. 

She studies the people she needs to impress, then wears her Jennifer Lawrence attempts at best actress to winning all their love.

Girls start to talk about football the minute a boyfriend is into football. If she changes her partner, her tastes changes immediately to suit the interest of the new partner. 

So one month she is a Chelsea fan, the next month she is a ManU fan. All depending on who she is with at any given time.

Then she becomes a lover of long-reads when she dates a long-reader. The next season she likes to club because new boyfie has a permanent seat at Quilox.

Check back in another season, she is anti-feminist because boyfriend can't stand feminism. 

When that charade is over, she meets a male feminist... now she is back to acting the part of a feminist. And updates her profile as a passionate fighter for the equality of the sexes.

Fashion tastes also fluctuate.. This new season, she hates makeup because boyfriend says his shirts are too expensive for the shoulder stain...

A few more seasons ahead, there's a new man...he is a makeup artiste, now babe is back to loving MaryKay. 

At the end of a lifetime, we never really get to meet the real woman. She has worn so many costumes, performed on so many stages, read so many scripts to fit the social and cultural puzzle of many families and friends...

And she never gets to live an authentic life.

I shudder.

I have seen relationships where the opinions of the neighbour, the bobo's mechanic, the random church member, the dull colleague... all count to determine its future. The dude rests on the approval of everybody to make decisions concerning his future with his woman.

I just can't. 

The Nigerian relationship/love has always been a dress rehearsal of some kind. A runway show where everybody gets to have an opinion about how a woman smiles, how she sits, eats; an xray of her opinions, her "godliness" etc.

And I think a "good person" is overrated. Especially when "good" is suggested by Nigerians. It is usually a despicable charade of little dignity and commonsense.  

Miss me with all of that.
