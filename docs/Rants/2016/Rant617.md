Feminism above everything else.

If you cannot accept that my daughters are equal to boys...

If you will argue that a woman should be assigned to certain limited aspirations and ambitions...

If you believe a girl's true achievement is in marriage, or a boyfriend or some kind of situationship with a man...

If you will badger teen girls on what to wear without telling boys how to treat them...

If you patronise women... box them under ridiculous tags like:."the African woman"...and all the condescending suggestions that usually follow to suppress, to crush...

If you mock feminism or even make snide remarks about the movement...

If you will not save yourself the sheer embarrassment of ignorance and genuinely get understanding on what we stand for...

I don't care what I have done for you before or what lovely post you have written about me earlier...

We are done.

I will not regard you as a human being. Since you believe my daughters are sub-humans.

It was last week that I refused dinner with someone I had spent an entire year admiring...only to hear his thoughts on an issue on abuse...

And his position upset me so greatly, I stopped feeling anything anymore. 

Maybe I have truly become a Feminazi...

An intolerant being.

Well, fuck you. 

We are not friends or kind acquaintances if you cannot accept a simple truth...

That women are, without any doubt, equal to men.
