About New Media Conference yesterday.

The best parts were... 

1. The buffet. Alot of dead animals on my rice that would give a vegan a heart attack. Loved it. 

2. The ambience. Four Points crossed all the 'T's on hospitality. 

3. Olori Supergal looked regal, happy, a little stressed (as should be expected), fulfilled. 

There's no blogger more successful than Olori Supergal. Beyond wealth, influence and goodwill will make you king.

4. The turnout was very impressive. A packed hall. Another crowd littered on the corridor. People come for conferences of this kind for different/many reasons. You can see the expectations on the faces.

5. The people who work for Olori, super polite- it made you want to cry.

6. Oscar, the MC, was a good balance of humour and professionalism. His suit could get him into the White House without proof of identity. 

7. Then there was Julius Agwu whom I sat next to... except I didn't know I was sitting next to him for about 15 minutes. I was reading from my phone Wana's interview with Emmanuel Iduma. For the sake of beautiful sentences which could be like a pat on my back before my session.

"Cosmopolitan angst". Emmanuel describes Lagos. And I traded Cosmopolitan for words like...

Bourgeoisie angst, which many people suffer on the Island part of Lagos. 

Trepidation of not meeting up to certain materialistic ambitions, or pretense. 

Which, if you do not suffer, could be one of the best things that can happen to your earthly existence. 

Island behaviour amuses me. 

A hello starts from your shoes to your wrist then to your hair. So you know if you are going to get a curt hello or a congenial one.

But everything is in the eyes. Your fear, your confidence, your anxiety, your peace.

They miss that part. You can bury intellect under a heap of manure, they don't care. Just own a fancy car and a few rare colourful Louboutins.

An acquired accent along the streets of Dallas to Manhattan is also very important. Even if you are going to go home later and cry out the debts you are piling up...like a N45million bill that could lead you to a bridge and force you to jump 

So I was preoccupied with beautiful sentences, when I got a nudge by the person beside me.

"Hello."

I turned, said a quick reply...then did a double take and started laughing. 

He was laughing too.

"I didn't know it was you, good afternoon." 

"Good afternoon. I can see you like to read."

"Ah. Sometimes," I blushed.

"You haven't looked up to see if you are sitting next to wild beasts or human beings since you walked in. Your head is buried in your phone, reading. What are you reading?" He asked.

"An interview, by people who write well."

"Ah! So what's your name?"

"Joy"

"What do you do?"

"I'm a writer. I think"

"You think?"

"I don't know anymore. I do alot of other things now."

"My name is Julius Agwu, I am a..."

"Of course, I know who you are!"

When he laughs, you can tell he has come through fire into a place of calm and beauty and peace. His eyes hold a secret. As if he has been somewhere he wouldn't be able to describe with mere words.

"I like your shoes. And I like your dress."

"Thank you, Mr. Agwu"

"I saw this event on twitter, so I decided to come and see what it is about. Are you going to be speaking?" 

"Yes, I'll be speaking later," I said.

"Ok. I am here. I will wait for your session."

I was sure I was going to break his heart when I start to talk about Feminism and my abhorrence of Patriarchy.

But he took it all in, and even grabbed the microphone to add a few kind words during my session. 

I had heard about his Abuja event last year (I think) and how some people complained that he turned it into a pentecostal revival of some sort.

For some reason, I think I now empathise. 

Julius has been through something that many of us may never understand. 

You change when certain things happen to you.

He changed. But he is still a comedian. Just a more spiritually inclined one. 

And that is ok.

PS: Big congrats to a Olori Supergal for a brilliant and more colourful second edition of #NMCLagos
