So...

We are still here in 2016...

Screaming to women to leave abusive relationships. 

*yawn*

Samsung introduces a new phone every other month.

LG is fixing mosquito repellant device in their air-conditioners.

KIA is thinking of creating a sports car. 

We have portable devices that can test if your food is gluten free.

First world is creating fuel cells to produce cheaper electricity 

International brand, Ikea, has a chainless bicycle that never rusts.

There are microwaves that can monitor diabetes. 

Should I go on? 

Rats no longer fall for the crayfish in the rat gum in your house. 

Mosquitoes don't die when you spray (cheap) insecticide anymore.

Abusive men too have evolved. They have creative ways of humiliating you- 

All they need to say is: "You look like a cow in that dress" and smile, hold your hand and add..."But I love you still."

You begin to wonder if this isn't worse than a slap.

For those with less impressive IQs, they slam your head against the wall...and when you die of head injury, they tell the neighbour you died a jealous wife who couldn't stand his cheating habits. You killed yourself. 

Which is actually true.

If you stay in an abusive relationship... you are the one with a knife to your throat.

You are a murderer. You are an accomplice to your own death.

Even in death, you are guilty.

Everything evolves...

Except the woman.

We can't still be talking about walking away from abusive relationships in 2016.

I refuse to be part of that conversation.

What we fail to realise is abusive men LOVE being abusive.

It is time you hold the women responsible for their choices, their abuse...

And their demise.
