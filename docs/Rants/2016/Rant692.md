As we carry on with our daily hustle, trying to locate our miracle...

Be reminded that a man is in police custody for calling his dog 'Buhari'.

Yet the incredible truth is: there is nothing you can do about it. Our helplessness is similar to the death of chickens for stew. The helplessness the chicken suffers when it is about to be killed in a bucket of hot water, feathers torn out, knife to the throat. 

Powerless. Zero dignity.

Tell me again about patriotism and putting Nigeria first.

Tell me about loving my country. Tell me about baby boomers and listening to elders. 

Let me hear you talk about investing in Nigeria. 

Let's talk about our voices effecting change... when a woman can be slaughtered like a pig for preaching.

Let's talk about political bloggers picked up and the rest of us moving on. After a few hours of calling out the government... how our collective amnesia blurs the experiences of others.

So tell me again about speaking up for Nigeria. Standing for your rights. Speaking back to the police. Confronting the ruling class. Attacking the judicial system. 

This is not a country. It is that simple. 

There's not one thing Nigeria has done for me. Not one thing.

Carry on with your business quietly. Move slowly.

There are no heroes here. They will throw you in jail and call you whatever they want, and it will stick. 

There's no justice. You sit on grass for abducted children and you will have to stand up soon enough to go and look for food, or clamour for relevant national positioning.

You die for Nigeria. You die in vain.

Nobody remembers. No holiday in your name. No statue for your fight. No benefits to your children left behind.

Like a dead rat, you'll be forgotten. 

You will not get a befitting burial from the government. Unless you are a thieving politician and part of a caucus of abysmal national deceit.

It wouldn't matter if you are the coach of the national team with a record of many good deeds. You will not be remembered.

Why?

There's still a lot of stealing to do. They have to pilfer every single naira note before they die or expire. 

Greed is like the underwear blocking the toilet pipe. You flush, shit can't pass through... it's coming back to you, boiling to the top. You are daily confronting the same mess.

So you are looking at my child, tall beautiful Ife... and telling me she should play basketball for Nigeria...

And I laugh. 

I will not hand over my child to the famous national mockery.

I will not let an idiotic baby boomer tell my child, "who sent you to Rio?"

You will not throw a cheap jumpsuit on my child as a symbol of her patriotism. 

And as I have lived my own life where I give no one any right to decide the measure of my faith or action...

I will not give my child up to Nigerian Twitter for rebuke...in a country that supplies zero facility. Your patriotic expectations of others are stupid.

She will use her height for technology at Silicon Valley. Or any personal goals of her choice.

I don't owe Nigeria nothing. 

As long as I have to continue to break concrete to find flowers everyday for survival...

This is not a country.
