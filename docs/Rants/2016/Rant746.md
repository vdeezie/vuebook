I want to talk about yam.

Yes, yam.

I started pounding yam for my father when I was about 13. With my older half-siblings, we would pound yam almost every night because dad didn't think eba was an option...

Edo men do not eat amala either.

Pounded yam is first choice. Pounded yam is the only choice. (OK, there was semovita for sombre moments.)

It was a beautiful routine. The sound of mortar hitting the foundation of the house.

Dad ate pounded yam and afang soup. He would use afang soup for his rice, his boiled yam, his bread.

If he could roll it and smoke it, he would. 

But I deviate.

This post is about yam.

I haven't pounded yam for many years. I took a break in my 20s. 

Except for that one time I had to flex my skill at, say, 25... pounded yam for a pastor.

My mother looked at me like I had gone absolutely mad.

"Me wey be your mama, you nor pound yam for me oh. Na pastor you dey pound yam for with my mortar. You sure say you well so?"

My brother just hissed and shook his head. "You will learn. Life will teach you," his silence passed a subtle message.

Needless to say that I learnt. Religion is not for me. At all. Pastors can eat raw yam if they like.

At Ake festival, an admirer, YE, had asked if he could bring me tubers of yam from Oyo state.

Yam? 

Yes, yam. Did I have a car that would take it straight to my house in Lagos? 

Tubers of yam, you say?

Who gives yam to the object of their fascination? I wondered.

But then it made sense. Yam makes sense.

There is recession. If you bring flower to my house, I will flog you with it. 

Yam. Yes. Definitely.

Yam works. 

I like practical love.

Will the object of your desire not eat? Ehen nah!

Bring rice too if you can. Big bag of rice for Christmas. And palm oyel for my mother. 

Feel free to squeeze in a rolex watch, a smart phone, a laptop (I need a laptop desperately), and maybe flight ticket to Miami. 

I hear it is N400k to New York these days.

Love in the time of Recession makes practical sense. 

And I love how I am being loved.

PS: Ladies, wait for it. Wait for your 40s. It is glorious, I tell you.

I am almost there. And I can smell the pounded yam.
