Naira is now 500 to Â£1...

We can't run effective small/medium scale businesses because of the surge. People are losing their jobs.

General inflation and personal depression working hand-in-hand to destroy many Nigerians. 

We are getting ready to produce pencils in 2018 in a world obsessed with breakthrough technology where car-to-car communication is possible to reduce car crashes. 

We still don't have any healthcare policies that can protect the ordinary Nigerian. No medical facilities to attend to ailments except headache and malaria.

Our educational institutions are churning out graduates who cannot succeed at the simplest attempt at sarcasm... into a society with no jobs.

Security emergency is non-existent. The police is under-funded, unenlightened, unprepared.

We are denied basic amenities for even the most banal existence...

Yet, what pastors care about is Marriage. Who cooks the meal. Who can pray for one hour. Marry a church member. Serve a glass of water on your knees. 

They feast with corrupt leaders, and tell victims of abuse to remain in bad marriages.

They flaunt wealth in the faces of their givers. Open expensive schools. 

They have mastered the effective use of fear and anxiety to paralyse rational thinking. 

I know surgeons and engineers stuck in churches, attending to their heavenly ambitions. Their worth reduced to serving tea to a pastor who probably couldn't get a degree in any basic academic pursuit. 

What really is the use of religion? 

If for instance you do no want to get married or have kids... how important is religion to you?

What more does religion teach after telling the wife to submit and the husband to provide?

What more after praying your way to quadruplets? What else?

Religion is not interested in science. It is not interested in how the world works, how it evolves. It has no interest in fixing African corruption. Morals are only for poor people. Wealth of any kind is usually celebrated, not questioned. 

Religion is only interested in building swanky nuclear families with the ability to smile for the camera, and wear crisp asoebi. 

Religion wants submissive wives and sexually satisfied husbands. 

Then when religion is bored, it attempts to preach financial freedom... where it tells the employee to "be your own boss".

Why then do we place any form of significance on religion?

There is no benefit to this madness in 2016.

Get rid of it!

One minute they tell you television is a tool of the devil. The most basic of science. 

The next minute, they are flying in private jets, enjoying advance science with zero input or interest on how they can get their thousands of simpletons to think outside the box and be part of a colourful world.

Why do we still tolerate religion?

We are putzing around this rubbish, getting entertained by its incredulous idiocy...when we should abolish it totally.
