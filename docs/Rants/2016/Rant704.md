This little post is titled: The Irony of Life.

So I was looking for a great writer, abi?

"A god with a pen/keyboard" as I call it.

I poured my heart out on a post... what I wanted in that writer. 

I haven't found the writer.

But someone read that post and sent me a message.

"I hope you find the writer you are looking for... because I have found the one I am desperately searching for."

Err... she found me.

My own vacancy post got me a nice writing gig.

I have two new scripts to write.

I have collected my cheque.

It is a good cheque.

Writing can buy you a good life... or leave marks of poverty on your back.

It's up to you.

Someday I will talk to young writers... gather them in a hall...and just talk.

This idea of writing only poetry... you want to starve to death? 

In what world does prose pay your bills?

Write everything. Learn how to write many genres.

Write plays. Write TV series and movie scripts. Write documentaries. Biographies. Essays.

Get a writing job and a writing side job and a writing second side job.

Make that money.

Writing is the only job that wants you at any age.

Write. Damn it!

If you are a writer, just write. 

Happy weekend!
