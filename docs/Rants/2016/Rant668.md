Dear Nigerian Employee,

If you've been working in an office for over four months and you receive a salary constantly- waaaaaaay above minimum wage, here are things you must ensure you do...

If there's no trash can in your place of duty, for god'sake buy it with your money! Do no write a report requesting a trash can for use or bother your boss about trash cans.

It's trash can! It costs less than N500! And you never have to buy it again. Buy the damn thing. Show you have the ability to be responsible.

If you receive a salary every month, do not open your mouth to tell your boss that you cannot send a text message as requested because you have no credit on your phone. 

What is wrong with people?!!

I cannot remember the last time I bought tissue paper in my office. My editorial assistant always ensures there is tissue paper for my use. Tucked inside my cupboard. When I am able to get my mind around that need, I give a bulk sum to her to make it available.

It might seem like a casual conduct at the office, but it is a big deal in a society where people just wait to be fed without really giving back.

If there's no diesel or the generator needs immediate servicing or we need to subscribe to an app or something of importance...

My creative executive is there to make that haopen. He ensures it gets done. He will bring out N15k to buy diesel for work to go on without waiting for me. 

If the A/C is bad, he calls the repairer and fixes it. And pays. Later reimbursed.

These two are priceless.

My editorial assistant comes all the way from Ogun state everyday, yet she's the one who holds the office key. Why?

She gets there early! Before people from across the street make it to their own offices.

My creative executive is so responsible, I can tell you he'd be the first person to jump up if the generator goes off. Not the front desk officer whose job it is to check with these things...

Nor the over 10 men working at the sister company next door.

Two of them are responsible! Do you know how that warms my heart?

I've been through fire with over 20 workers... and only these two came out unscarred. 

The Daniels in my den.

Many people want to earn what they have not worked for. Living up to a challenge is not part of the deal. 

In this Buhari economy? Who is going to keep feeding your unimaginative ass?!

I have held company events with my money. I give recharge cards on my show with my money. I have treated prospective clients to very expensive dining with my money (still the business partnership did not work out oh). And I keep taking big men/women prospects to expensive lunch and dinner to ask for partnership and sponsorship without ever requesting the monies back from the chairman.

Nigerian employee, the way you give your all to an average uninspiring relationship, is the same way you should give your all to your job.

Especially one that pays you.

Lazy ass people want to be left alone to decay on a job. Do not rattle them. Don't give them new challenges. Don't question their disastrous work ethics...and you'll be fine.

But the minute you judge their performance... they begin to tear up. They yank the cross from Jesus and carry it on their backs. A method to keep you away, to sympathise... to deal with their analog methods. 

Showing up to work is not all there is to do to get paid. If you shut your heart to new thinking then you are no better than an old scratched CD in a Download generation.

Because thinking is the hardest part of the job. And it's so much easier to just say the boss is mean...than to admit your head is blocked.

If you are anything like my assistant editor and my creative executive then we will be fine.

I have my bad mouth and my fire...but they are not for you.

Just for being responsible...you have passed the test. 

*whew*
