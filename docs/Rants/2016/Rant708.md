Everyday we celebrate births. Lots of rejoicing.

Children are born after 9 months in the sack.

Over 7 billion people alive. Many births have happened in this present world.

We see it everyday on social media. A click of your smart phone to capture the frown of your newborn... brought to the world via a vagina.

I am yet to find one human being who ripped a rib out of his own body to form another being.

So when I am expected to disregard what I see everyday... and what I have experienced twice as a woman, only to believe something propagated by greedy deluded people in a space so dark and gloomy yet preaching light and love and exhibiting nada...

I wonder.

Do you think me to be dumb?

Every human being comes through the womb. You see it everyday. So what's with this rib story that religion uses to tame women?

*

Everyday, someone is screaming to a woman to submit. 

Women monitor the submission of other women. And judge if their submission is the appropriate method to submission.

The part of submission in the bible is one sentence long. 

As long as the instruction for men to LOVE their wives as Christ loved the church.

How did Christ love the church?

He fucking died, yo!

Some of these men cannot make money, pay school fees... they owe rent, steal from their aunties, have no proper jobs, cheat, and get away with all kinds of ish.

How is it then that your religion isn't talking more to men?

Why everyday badger our social media space with submission?

Love comes first. Love is the root, submission is the leaf.

And that's for people who want to live in that bubble. 

I say it is better to just be partners. 

Partners in lovemaking. Partners in making money. Partners in building careers. Partners in contributing to life and society.

Partners.

But what do I know?
