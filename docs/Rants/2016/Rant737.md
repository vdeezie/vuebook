Anybody can cook up any lie about a woman's sexual life.

Anybody.

I hope y'all know that? 

It doesn't require talent. It doesn't require common sense. 

It is such an artless craft that even a mad man on the street, butt naked, call women who refuse to pay any attention to his insanity, Ashawo. 

It is the key word to shut women up.

Having access to the Internet and having a dead brain full of fabricated vagina stories doesn't make you a slayer.

That you are able to gather likes and comments under a vagina slut-shaming episode proves that majority of people are dumb. I mean, look at America, Trump won! What other measure shall we use to judge the stupidity of the majority?

We have told women over and over again...

If you have to insult another woman, if it is so necessary to be so low... leave her vagina alone. Be creative; find something else. 

-Because you have your own vagina with its terrible stories of fuckboys and abusive men to inspire you to shut up. Tell your own shame through your own vagina. 

But no.

Women are still shaming other women's vagina.

"That 45 year old useless man that slept with a 25 year old girl should be ashamed of himself. Sending her texts and asking for a doggy. Shameless man..."

Said no one on earth.

So why, pray tell, do you think you can shame a woman's vagina?

Especially from women who claim their vagina cannot be shamed.

What level of low is this?

Get an education. Improve your vocabulary. And if you have to hate, hate with a measure of finesse and enterprise.

It really is shocking the wretched intellection of many women and men.

But how then can we expect men to respect the vagina they don't possess... if women continue to use it as an instrument for shaming the next woman?

Check your miserable horny lives.

This shit makes no sense in 2016.
