Nigerian Feminist: I can buy my own food...because when you buy my food, you may think you own me. But as a gentleman, it is important you open the door for me. It is important that you validate my presence. My body is mine. I do not wish to be seduced. I want to have only feminist sex, where I am not objectified... but please feel free to tell me that my boobs are full and soft. You do not have to worry about bride price, but fixing things in the house is your role. I do not, however, subscribe to gender roles. I will scrub the floor... but only because I love scrubbing floors. It shouldn't, in anyway, suggest I am beneath you. If you cheat on me, I will be very upset because I am a beautiful woman and equal to you. I shall tear the limbs of your mistress...and proceed to give you great feminist sex. The vagina is powerful and I want you to treat it as such. I am the new morning. I am the cool breeze. I am the calm evening. Yada Yidi Yugu Yigi Yaga. Blurp. Fart.
