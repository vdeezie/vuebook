It is Patriarchy that makes us believe our mothers are indebted to us in some ways when we start to pop babies.

People say, "nor be her grand pikin? She go take care of am nah. Make I go live my life."

Your mother also has a life. Yes, even at 68.

I certainly do not accept the notion that grandmothers love taking care of grand children.

It is, for her, as frustrating, time demanding and limiting to personal goals, as it is for us.

If you have a mother who takes care of your children while you "live your life"...

Recognise that it is not her responsibility.

I know culture explains this away...and I am aware that many parents cajole and manipulate their children to have grand kids (for them)...

Still, it is not her primary duty to care for your children. 

My mother plays a healthy 45% role in the duties of motherhood as it relates to my children.

Not a day goes by that I do not allow myself to feel grateful for her role.

It is not her responsibility. 

I am always going to remember that when I pick up the phone to call her concerning my kids, she is helping out. Doing me a favour.

I hold my breath when I have to tell her that the kids are coming over for a "few days".

Of course she is going to chuckle and say it is fine.

But it isn't exactly "fine" if the arrangement doesn't sit well with her own plans.

Or you think your old mother doesn't have plans of her own...even if it only involves eating unripe plantain and watching Africa Magic in peace?

But our mothers never say these things. Culture forbids.

Just know they would rather be having sex with a hot male than cleaning shit from your baby's diapers.

We don't ever want to see our mothers in that light...but they are humans. They are exactly that way!

We take advantage of a culture that judges grandmothers and makes them feel useless when they refuse to play active roles in the lives of their children's children.

What if she wants to travel the world at 61?

What if she wants to go under the knife and slice 20 years off her original age so she can find a lover?

What if she wants to fall in love all over again with her husband- probably your father- and needs none of that grandchild distraction?

What if she doesn't want to be involved with parenting a toddler? 

What if she prefers sitting in a rocking chair all day, reading a magazine?

What if all she wants to do is call up the only friend she has who is still alive for chit-chat that could stretch to midnight? 

These rights are not irresponsible.

We should remember that equality covers even the rights of old women.

Their happiness is just as important. 

If you've got a mother like mine...just remember that she is doing you a huge favour. 

PS: I say this now because I am very certain that at 60, I will be married to a lovely 62 year old white man who still gives me neck massages...

And I will not be available to bath any newborn.
