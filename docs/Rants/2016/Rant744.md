It is not cute to beg on people's social media walls. It is not. Please stop it. 

People should share their "happinesses" in annoying doses to the gnashing of your perceived lack without believing, in some ways, that they owe you a piece of what they have. 

Don't beg.

It is not the time. 

We are all in recession.

If you have value, then bring to the table. Let us make an exchange of your worth for mine. It is how proper societies should work. It is how your parents should train you.

How is it that I will buy books for my children, and someone would think she is deserving of a "mini laptop" from me? How, for godsake? 

At what point do you convince yourself that if an acquaintance owns a property, you are entitled to a spare room?

Which religion or thought is feeding you that shit?

Ask and you shall be given? No! Don't ask, you shall not be given. Your pastor lied. You are reading your religious books upside down.

I work. I work and sometimes I want to marry a sugar daddy just so I don't have to work again. You hear?
Maybe get a bae like Bobrisky's bae, and be flashing nonsense cash like an idiot on instagram, with petals like a halo on my head to consummate my eternal idiocy on Snapchat. 

Yes. That nonsense thought has crossed my mind too. Fuck feminism. I want someone to take care of my bills so I can stretch my legs on the beach at Seychelles and read all 25 books I have bought from Ake since last year that almighty Work will not allow me to enjoy.

But here I am, hustling for me and two girls. YET you think you need to ask me for anything. Why?

You don't have a child. You don't have responsibilities. You are younger. You have unlimited freedom to think, create, build, grow.

So what the hell is your problem?

There is no room for self pity, especially the Nigerian kind.

If you want used textbooks to read, I have them. But what the fuck makes you think you should request for anything brand new from a single mother counting her pennies to the next house rent and school fees?

What makes it ok for a vibrant, healthy 20-ish individual to ask for a laptop from me or any other parent hustling through this economic mess.

What fabric is this entitlement made of?

This kind of squeaky clean greed is grating! Stop it.

I shared the story of a well dressed white executive who I met at the bus stop in Manhattan. His bag as a pillow. His jacket as a duvet. He was set to go to bed. Because society that will progress will continue to tell you in many ways that you are your own responsibility. 

This idea that any random social media handle can help you is really a terrible thing. And when I see 21 year olds catch feelings on this habit, I get really sad... you are the generation that we hope will come with some dignified pride and new knowledge. 

What are you doing begging for smart gadgets? Do you know if I have one?

Why the hell are you begging on people's walls? If you are so desperate, can you not sneak into their inbox, drop a message and let it ferment?

Stop it.

Nobody owes you anything.

When I didn't have anything. I didn't get anything. 

Now there's a lot of exchange. You give your talent for the worth of the other person. They place their numbers on the table- sometimes in millions, or in thousands. Other times in opportunities to harvest. 

You write. You get paid. 

Nobody gives to the poor.

You must understand that. 

The poor is bad investment. It is why people hand N200 notes to them at best or a pack of sugar with the curses of all their ills placed on it for the poor to inherit, at worst. 

Nobody really gives to the poor.

Stop being such a lousy "poor" cyber person. 

Go and work, abeg.

Me that I am writing 15,000 word document daily... am I mad?
