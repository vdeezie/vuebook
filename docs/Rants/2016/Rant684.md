It could be that the reason we are telling 21 year olds to get married is because we really don't know what to do with them.

Nigeria has no clue what to do with its youth. We cannot engage a child, even at 5.

Apart from basic education- uniform, textbooks and Debating Society... there's nothing more to keep our children thinking. Thinking out of the box is totally out of the way.

It's the holidays, if you can't take your children on a N689,000 flight to Chicago or a N315,000 trip to Dubai... then you and your children will have to stay at home and think of ways to crack some fun out of a country designed without consideration for their leisure or curiosity. 

Children spend 16+ years pursuing some form of education in Nigeria that is rudimentary at best...

When it's all done, they manage to get jobs (most of the time humdrum)...then they spread their material out for marriage bargain.

There are no ballet classes, no music schools, no film academy... we don't have a technology base that can get them excited seeing what the world can become with science (please do not be tempted to mention one tiny practice in your locality as the solution to leisure).

We don't have institutions that keep the young productive. We don't have a society that remembers to engage the youth.

We are not thinking of space buses or any intriguing idea that can divert the attention of the young from obsessing over a (wo)man.

So what you have are bicycles and movie tickets and amusement parks and dirty beaches for your kids.

After a week, there's nothing more to explore. DSTV isn't even rich enough with kiddie programmes to keep them busy. 

They are going to read books (which is great) and learn to fly to these places they read about in their dreams.

So when you have exhausted your personal efforts on how to make your child great in a decrepit society... you will make church-going some kind of art... a hobby.

Then the discussion that will keep you sane would be "soon you will get married".

How many of you have ever told your 18 year old daughter/niece/cousin that, "soon you will join a group of people to produce mobile homes that can be folded like a file and carried around to any location"?

We don't have those kind of conversation. That is not how we speak around here.

We only speak of working up a booby trap for love, being wife material, learning how to cook and pray.

It is why your sports minister cannot understand this zeal of young Nigerians to be in Rio.

"Their mates are married, and they are embarrassing themselves upandan..." He will scream into his plate of food when his wife of 23 years sets the table.

It is more an achievement for the Nigerian to be married than to fight for his/her dreams.
