I like strong women. 

It is probably my biggest weakness.

I will go wherever a strong woman goes.

She'll fight for a cause she truly believes in.

It is the most glorious thing to watch. 

I have seen too much weakness displayed by us, by women... I cannot cry any more tears for any woman; I cannot feel any pain, bleed any more despair.

If you want justice. If you want to roar. If you want conversation that is empowering and unpopular...that's all I want. That's all I need. 

No more victims. No more fear. 

Be strong or go home.

That should be the mantra.

I watch Viola Okolie fight for Chacha. I see Pamela Nwansoh take shots for Chacha. 

Then there's Amanda Chisom who will not let any idiot get away with idiocy.

And Ifedimma Onwugbufor who has received blows... thrown out of her page, stood in the centre of a war and still will not be silent on a matter that she could have casually ignored. 

My spirit aligns with the strength of these women. 

I have followed their posts and the consequences of their unpopular actions... and I am so proud to say, "I met you here."

Chichi Nnani is, of course, writing her anger on concrete so it never goes away.

Generations will come and they will read about this angry feminist who did not buckle under any pressure. Who was made stronger by the anger of a mob.

They wrote their posts. They stood by their words. 

They did not flinch. They did not cower. Let the words bleed love or rage, what does it matter.

I am always careful of people who are too careful. Who repent too easily. Who give in too quickly. Who take out evidence too fast. Who want to be seen as good.

Whatever that means.

The concept of death is a beautiful thing.

You die so you can truly live.

Not many people are alive. 

If you are always watching your words... deleting and editing your thoughts. Flinching at every word of fright...

You are dead. Beneath every living thing.

Salute to the ones with grit and fire.
