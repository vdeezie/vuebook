It seemed half a century ago when I had loud disagreements with my neighbours. 

Threats, even.

They had a script. A script they believed a young single mother of two living next door should fit into.

I was the new neighbour. I looked young. I have two kids. Living in the same kind of apartment they stuffed themselves in.

I was supposed to be vulnerable. And needy. And nice to a point of incredible selflessness. 

And probably ashamed. Asking for someone to cover this position I shouldn't occupy.

This position as the head of my own life. Of my own home. Of my own children. 

Too shameful. Where is the covering of a man?

So they volunteered, without permission, to get me out of this problem of mine...

They asked for my kids to come around for prayers. 

They wanted me to hurry to their sitting room whenever their prophet called...

-Because it is impossible to be divorced and fully responsible for two children... and be happy all at once.

They wanted to cure me of this unhappiness. And probably pray for me to meet another husband.

One that might spring from their religious caucus. 

They wanted nieces and nephews to enjoy the freedom and access to my own comfort. 

Wanted to share a few bric-a-brac off my shelf. And maybe off theirs too.

And I continued to place boundaries every single step of the way.

I stopped my children from praying with them because it allowed for judgments on my own spiritual journey. 

And of course, I never honoured any fadafuckin' call from a prophet.

A hard knock on my window on Sunday by, say, 7am...

"Mummy Ife, are you not going to church?"

"No."

"Why?"

Why? I would chew on the why until it lost its sour taste. 

Why? 

What gives anyone the right to question another  adult's decision to sleep through her Sunday morning?

I built walls as high as the Great wall of China. 

And when they saw how high my walls had gone, they became very resentful. 

Very bitter. Very judgmental. They came together to build a formidable force to try to, well...

Break me.

Isn't that always the story? *yawn* (losers everywhere)

They were so deluded in their hate that they would harm their own chances just to hurt me.

One time, PHCN cut off my electricity supply from my meter because they are a clueless bunch of retards who go around without records of paying clients. 

I wasn't owing. I've been paying exorbitant electricity bills for years. But my light was cut off because I am not a woman who sits at the window everyday waiting for stupid PHCN staff to show up so I can wave my receipts.

So when I got home and found that there was no light in my apartment, I naturally called an electrician to fix it.

PHCN staff took the keys with them, so electrician had to pass through iron wrought to do the work. 

My neighbour passed by...then decided the good thing to do the next day was to call a welder to fix an extra iron rod so no one could make an easy pass. 

But the thing is...I've got receipts to show I pay every month. 

They, however, have fabulous PHCN bills running to over N150k...that they cannot offset. 
But at that minute, jealousy and rage for the audacity of a young woman who chooses to live differently from the script they have written, blindly consumed commonsense. 

Three months down the line, the iron rod was cut out...by the same neighbour.

Because poverty is still more sensible than jealousy. 

(How are you going to fix your light when PHCN finds you and your N150k owing ass?)

After losing your breath over my audacities, you'd have to accept that I am entitled to being different.

...to not want anything but to live on my own terms.

I don't understand how that can be so hard for people to accept in 2016.

We are cordial now. 

Even the mother of the house who had slapped her hand on the ground to swear that I would pack out of that premises...couldn't possibly understand how much of a good prayer that was.

I mean, since when did Festac become a choice residential location?

Hell yeah, I want to move out of this town...Heck,  this country!

Poverty will not let people think straight. 

Mix that with unnecessary envy...

And you have a time bomb that will self destruct.

But we are cordial now ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
