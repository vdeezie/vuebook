It was at Yaba market that I met a masquerade last week. In broad day light. With a cane as long as an iroko tree. Begging me for money. 

No, not begging... Demanding that I part with my N500.

He saw me. He knew I was out of place. He came to me. First, he announced his presence with theatrics to frighten me, perhaps. Then he stood right in front of me, slapping the cane on the floor. 

People scurried off. Clutching their bags to their chests.

"Give me money" he said.

"Which money?" I asked.

He slapped the cane on the floor. This time a dog panicked. 

"Give me N500"

I laughed so loud even angels in heaven had to join in.

"Abeg, excuse me." I said and made to walk away. He blocked my way.

"Give me money or I go flog you."

"Start flogging."

I walked away. He followed me behind.

"Oya give me som'tin. Na tradition."

"Which dirty tradition?" I hissed

He said something I can't remember.

"I am not giving you anything." I insisted. 

"I will flog you oh"

"Flog nah!"

I kept walking to my car parked at a distance. Waiting for the cane to touch my back so I can tear that rag off his face.

"Oya give me N100"

"You are getting nothing from me."

Now I was angry. Cheap ass tradition. 

I got to my car and gave the cartwheel hustler who wheeled my goods N2,000. His money was supposed to be N500. But I was so pissed I felt like rewarding the only man who treated me with some kind of gender-less respect in the last 3 hours of shopping.

From the traders in the market to masquerades... misogyny is raw and smelly on these streets.

Now someone will tell me about culture and tradition and how we should return to yada-yada. This is your culture begging for N100 on the streets.

Culture and tradition tie children born club-footed at traditional bone-setter huts with ropes until the legs are completely destroyed and modern/civilised doctors have to amputate them.

Stop blaming civilisation and the white man for your many stupid mistakes. 

Your culture is a broke man on the streets of Yaba harrasing women.
