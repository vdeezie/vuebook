"Privileged" children and gratitude.

How do we teach our children gratitude?

Do we deny them basic things? What kind of parent would that make us? 

Children only ask for random stuff- a bar of chocolate today, a pair of sneakers tomorrow. 

Nothing out of the ordinary.

But when we do financial aerobics for their sake...is it unfair to expect gratitude? 

You know, the gushing type that fills the room with joy. 

I am always amazed by how "poor" kids acknowledge gratitude. They seem always thankful. 

A father returns from laying bricks all day...with a pack of groundnuts for his son. 

The child starts to run from his mother's ogogoro kiosk to give his weary father a big hug...

And when dad hands him his pack of groundnuts, he is ecstatic. 

He shows it off to his neighbours...and chews it ever so elegantly like it is made of honey and cheese.

It's just groundnuts. It's probably the only thing he'll get in a long time. 

Is it lack that allows the poor child appreciate even the air he breathes?

How can we teach our own children to be thankful for the many things we do?

And we do a whole lot for it to be seen as ordinary. 

I'm just curious, really.

It seems middle class kids lose the spark in their eyes too soon.

Their ambitions grow too big...before they even become teenagers. 

And it seems only a vacation to Dubai can get them excited beyond a minute.

Nothing else matters.

You take them to the mall and tell them to take anything they want...

They want nothing. 

You buy them laptops...in a few months they are bored. 

Toys? Nah!

You move mountains, jump valleys, skip across the Sahara...

They get used to things too quickly. 

And the next minute you need to find ways to engage them.

Poor kids play with bottle corks and radiate the kind of happiness that you can sell for a million dollars.

Is it God's way of rewarding the "have nots"?

This endless happiness...This genuine satisfaction and contentment they share amidst dirt and poverty.

How can we teach our own children to daily appreciate the little and big things they have that come from the sweat and toil of hardworking parents?

We didn't steal this money nah. Middle-class Nigerians work too hard...

How do we pass on that message to our children so they are constantly in awe of their privileges?

In other news, we had a good day at Amusement Park today. 

We watched Kungfu Panda at the cinema. And got scared by a crazy ride on a 5D display. 

BUT...they get over these things too quickly. Not a trace of the fun is left on their faces.

They are expecting the next big thing.

Nah. How about you chew on this one for longer?

Is this a "privileged" habit? For kids to just move on after a helluva experience?

I don't know why I am just noticing this now. 

My first child will be 11 years old this year. 

Surely, she should begin to appreciate the drudgery of parenting by just observing my unbelievably overwhelming work schedule, and how I am able to squeeze out time (and a lot of money) to entertain them. 

PS: Please let us not drag this conversation through the..."It is not money that will satisfy the kids, just spend quality time with them."

Unless they are going to eat sand, mummy needs to work. 

And if we are truthful to ourselves, kids don't need adults around their space for too long. Quality time is a 30 minutes game and after a while they want to do other stuff on their own. 

Money is crucial. Whether it is watching a movie or buying popcorn...

I am never impressed when people try to downplay the all important role of a healthy bank account as it relates to good parenting.

I bought black market fuel tonight. N3,000 for 10 litres so my children can read their novels and play games before bedtime. 

That's money.

Just saying.
