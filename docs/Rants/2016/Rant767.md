Visited my mum at Christmas. 

So she had an opinion to share about one of her grand children (not my kids. She has promised to buy cane for Ife, by the way. Lol!)...

She went on about how the kid is acting "somehow"; how she isn't so cuddly anymore. And she thought it had to do with something her mother must have said...

I sighed. Yawned. Shook my head. Rolled my eyes. And responded:

"This child is 12 years old. Her body is changing. She is growing a pair of breasts. She is experiencing her first year of menstruation. She has school demands to meet. There may be a few students challenging her grades and position in school. She may be contemplating joining some kind of kiddie's fraternity to endorse her "cool chick" status...

She must have friends she needs to impress. She probably likes a boy. She may want a new gadget her dad (my brother) is unwilling to buy. She may be influenced by some of the cheesy programmes on DSTV...

Trust me mum, there's a lot of things on a pre-teen's mind that has NOTHING to do with your bloody issues with any of her parents.

I feel that way about my kids too. Especially Ife.  She gets really moody sometimes. She stays hours without wanting to talk. She snaps at her sister. She snobs. She gets irritated easily. Disinterested. 

When I am VERY CERTAIN it is not a reaction to any form of abuse in school- physical, emotional or sexual; or some form of academic depression (as school is the only place away from my direct care), I let her be.

She is a human being with her own peculiarities. And I think it'd be silly for anyone to attribute this phase to "something her mother (in this case, me) told her."

Adults should cease to believe that children care about what they get up to. Kids think adults are boring and crazy. They don't care much for the social pretenses adults put up. 

Now, my mother says she will not gossip with me anymore.

I don carry my leg go back to my house.

PS: I had a well rested Christmas. I'm watching Season Two of Games of Throne with fried chicken and orange pulpy.

Just the way I wanted it.
