This is for mothers (and fathers)...

If you can relate to this anxiety in parenting, raise your hands up.

I have an 11 year old and a 9 year old yet I still wash my plate after eating, I still sweep the floors, I still do the laundry (put the clothes in and out of the machine), I scrub the bathroom, the floors, I still clean dust off the furniture...

I literally do everything at home.

Heck, I still stand up to get the remote control by myself. I mean... which Nigerian parent still reaches out for the remote with two kids at home?

That's me.

I hate the mess synonymous to parenting. So I do everything myself.

When they wash their plates, the entire kitchen is messed up... water everywhere. If they sort out the laundry, it takes days to find some clothing...

When they sweep the floor and I take my slippers off, I can still feel sand. 

I think I have become that parent who cares only about grades.. if you do well in school then I'm fine.

But... that shouldn't be enough. There's still many domestic chores they don't get to do in my house. 

Thankfully they get to do stuff in their grandmother's home... but her voice is hoarse from dishing out instructions, and at one time she promised she'd buy a big fat cane at home for the kids.

She didn't. Whew!

But that's the point... I hate to shout at kids, so I just do the things myself. 

But how are they going to learn chores then?

I watch "Man vs. Child" on DSTV, a food show where children as young as 8 year olds compete against adults as chef of the week.

8 year olds are spinning flour in the oven and frying meat in hot oil...

I am yet to let my kids cook their own noodles. 

I remember when I was, say, 8 years old... I would stay in the kitchen with my 10 year old half brothers and we'll fry our plantain for dinner. Sincerely, I questioned how adults would let us fry plantain at that age. What if we tripped and hit the oil down... or something.

I'm so paranoid that when I drop them off at grandma's, I have to watch them open the gate and watch her receive them before I drive off.

If I send them on errand even by 11am... I'm hanging by the window to be sure they'll be skipping back to me.

But I see 7 year olds walk to school everyday without escort... Heck! Did I not see a 6 year old boy pulling his 4 year old sister to school the other day?

I always point them out to my kids...

"Who the hell let's a kid this tiny strut to school alone??!!!"

So my kids have become a routine of sort. All they do is read and pass and mum is happy. 

*scratches head*

I still empty the water dripping into a bucket from the air conditioner.

That's insane, right? 

Surely this can't be "right"... right?

Who else suffers this "disorder"?
