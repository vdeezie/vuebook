America.

If you visit the US with your eyes open, your excitement tucked in your bag, your discernment and sense of judgment worn like an insignia, you'll realise how possible a Trump presidency is.

Americans are racists. Just as Nigerians are "tribalistic". The average American is just as dumb as any average you'll find in many countries.

We have watched black people seek justice every other day on American streets without finding it.

Their intolerance and discriminations are made less visible by reason of smart technology and endless braggadocio. Their PR is one of the best in the world. The "Talk Big" culture is an American phenomenon. The grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side was made by America's exciting publicity.

America is like a playboy with dashing good looks; too much gloss, too many make-believe situations that protect its ignorance and prejudices from spilling out of its anus.

Truth is, many first world countries are better than America. The quiet billionaire status doesn't excite as much as the loud and proud millionaire always propping its head out of a bunch for a photo-op.

America is great. Just like jollof rice is great. Technology and PR can make relevant burning social problems go away.

Trump is the face that best describes the true intentions of the average American.

It is not just white privilege. It is privilege that can intimidate the next minority perceived as less important.

Caucasians are on top. Then all others. Then Indians. Then blacks.

Some lazy white Americans working in malls and fighting addictions believe they should own "plantation" for niggas to work in 2016. Decent society makes it impossible for that discussion to ever hold. But they think about it, and they like the idea. Trump isn't decent, and in many ways endorses this thought that cannot be voiced out by whites who are disgruntled with a system that pretends to act fair to everyone. They are the better race.

60% of white women voted for Trump. It says alot about misogyny practiced by women against women. Women need to deal with their own misogyny. We are always in denial, women. Always. How do you penetrate a gender always lying to itself. Sometimes we push the next woman under the bus because of something as trifling as a better nose!

We are sick. And it shows in first world election.

I don't care what women have against Hillary. Ok, she lies, abi? And you? Saint of the world?

It will take a while to find a woman as competent as Hillary for president. Heck, it will take a while to find anyone with her pedigree. With that position and experience comes alot of mistakes. Human mistakes. Yet white women did not gather around their own. They chose a man who wants to grab their pussies. 

"Let's make America great again" has an undertone of white privilege and sexism.

Women still believe to a large extent that they belong under a man. Even in first world countries where we hold cute international seminars on equality. 

In the last week, I have wished for Trump to win. Americans deserve this man. They deserve this reality show.

If Americans don't get their Donald Trump they are never going to get tired of hoping for a Donald Trump.

They have worked very hard to get to this point.

Like God gave the people of Israel Saul...

People deserve what they want. They need to experience it, learn from it and move on.

We have survived shitty rulers for over 50years in Nigeria, surely Americans can survive 4 years of Keeping up with the Trump's in the white house.

The average American will turn out smarter after this. Thank God for strong institutions greater than presidents, they will rebuild their nation eventually.
