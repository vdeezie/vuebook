Everything in Nigeria will strip you of dignity. 

You suffer an ailment that would require medical attention...yet doctors will toss you here-and-there and nurses will gossip and chat casually over your dying health.

Money in Nigeria cannot buy the amount of dignity made available freely to the poorest citizens in, say, Canada.

A child is raped or abducted and violated. Yet it is the victim's profile that will be circulated all over press and the Internet. The rapist will remain largely unknown and protected. 

I watched a video yesterday of two girls- 8 year olds being punished for the act of rape- as victims. They were sexually abused by a man. Yet the victims were told to kneel before their teachers. 

One of them, a man, had a cane to their heads.

"Oya talk the story. Shebi you used to go and call him to do it to you? Shebi you enjoy it..."

Then a cane landed on the head of one of the victims.

She is 8 years old. An adult male raped her. Yet teachers and society strip her of whatever dignity is left.

PS: I have launched a manhunt on that school and those teachers. We will find them. And we will deal with them accordingly...

And the rapist sent to court.

You sustain third degree burns in an accident in Nigeria...

There are no immediate medical response to save your life. 

You'll have to stroll to a car all by yourself... in raw excruciating pain!

And Nigerians will lift their phones to take a picture of you...like your pain is some kind of celebrity.

A man violates your children and abuses you...

Yet in the "counsel of elders", you- the woman- will be required to buy a cow and ten chicken born with red cloths around their necks. You will be told to dance naked in a river to cleanse your family...

(And you with your head in your butt will agree to such nonsense). 

Our culture, our lifestyle, our popular religions, our orientation strips all of us of dignity.

And the saddest part is how the next man revels in the indignity of others.

Breast cancer, for instance... to survive the ordeal of chemotherapy and getting your breasts sliced is the biggest victory any woman can record...

Yet we have religious bigots who make memes with breast cancer survivors as their tool for mockery.

With her breast sewn together like a cloth, these ones will ask that we pray to god to make the old witches, in the village sewing our destinies like this breast, suffer embarrassment.

Something like that. 

Something rid of basic discernment.

Now there's no light. No fuel. Yet law enforcement officials are harassing traders and buyers of black market...

Generators grumble to a halt. Work is static. Yet employers have to pay salaries...and employees have a right to request to be paid.

#

Nigeria is in dire condition...yet your senators are trying to "help" women by pushing for polygamy. 

Even in this tragic comedy, Nigerians still don't get it. 

Your dignity is in shreds.
