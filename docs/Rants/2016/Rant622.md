Sometimes people laugh...

Because they don't know what else to do.

But it seems young men are only interested in protecting male entitlements.

A man rapes...the minute we protest, you have men reminding us not to make it a "male bashing" issue.

The rest of them protest because we have the audacity to call out the penis...as if "penis" is not a fucking legit word.

This young lady here is trying to "save face". 

But no, we need to have a jury to determine whether she is having fun or being molested.

Sickos.  

If you have details on this, I will like to test the legal system in Nigeria and see if we can sue these teenagers for molestation...

Before they grow up to become entitled monsters.

I was 14 when I went to Mile 2 to buy a pair of socks...

I got to a store, there was the young man who wouldn't take his eyes off me. He immediately started "toasting"...

I was laughing, of course, because I didn't know what else I could possibly do.

So I giggled some more...all the while hoping he could leave me alone to buy my damn socks.

Thankfully he didn't have the colour I wanted. But he begged me to come back so we could go to a nearby bar to eat turkey and drink Malt.

He bade me "bye for now" by pinching the side of my breast.

Me? I was still laughing like a retard. 

I got into a bus and felt shame.

I was angry.

I cried. 

Every woman knows this laughter.

Every woman has a good idea what this type picture represents. 

So all you small boys (and big men)...

Shut up! 

You are so full of shit.
