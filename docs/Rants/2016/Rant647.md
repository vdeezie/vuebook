Penis is a leveler.

If you have unfortunately been with a man who thought someone of less ambition, beneath your cadre, attractive...

There's a rattle in the pecking order.

She begins to think you are, in some ways, similar...

That by passing through same penile path, you are both to be placed on the same pedestal...

And open to some form of comparison.

Questions that should never be asked: Who is more beautiful? Who has more style? Who's got more personality? Who has shinier skin? Bigger boobs? Bigger ass? Prettier lips?

Begin to form in the mouths of "bystanders".

When a penis is all you have in common...it is the most annoying kind of association. 

It is death by hanging.

You will try and try and try...

Your dreams are not the same. Your goals and intentions are very different. 

Motivation cannot be transmitted sexually.

Don't get it twisted.

You are still the maid.

And she is still the madam.

And if ever you will be elevated from house chores...

It will not come from sleeping with a man.
