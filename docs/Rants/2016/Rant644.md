So let me understand this...

The entire purpose of Religion is to make heaven. 

Getting a ticket into heaven is supposed to be our raison d'etre on earth?

We need to pray everyday. Meditate on the Word everyday. Go to church and get spittle in our hair from the pulpit...

Just so we can make heaven?

*scratches head*

So when we make heaven, what next?

We start to praise God everyday?

And since there's no time in the afterlife, it would mean praising Him forever?

What would He need all of that for? He is God whether stones or humans worship.

I'm confused. 

So religion that has been confirmed the foundation of our morality is just to ensure we head to heaven?

Our entire existence is so we can make heaven?

Our raison d'etre is to have a ticket to heaven?

We pray solely to live according to doctrines and make heaven?

Isn't that just really selfish?

We are heading to heaven to do what again?

Praise God till eternity?

It keeps going round and round in my head.

Is that why religious people struggle with sarcasm and have zero wit or knowledge...because this journey is just a straight and narrow road with no curiosity in science or attention to technology or interest in the beauty and tragedy caused by man on earth?

Is it why pastors are accumulating wealth for themselves and show very little interest in an evolving world, since the earth is just land for rape as they journey to heaven?

We go to church so we can make heaven and praise God till eternity.

That's it?

I'm confused. 

This is what happens when you allow yourself to wonder.

It is probably the reason churches advice their members not to "think too much".

Yes, we were told that when I was still a church goer.

*scratches head*

I should go an' ask God these questions.
