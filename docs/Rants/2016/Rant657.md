I saw naked women in Manhattan...

Tanning white skin. 

Bikini so tiny, it served no real purpose.

Bare breasts.

And a book or earphones to music.

Men weren't looking. Women didn't stare.

Nobody was judging the naked women with bare buttocks and breasts at picnic spots at Hudson Water Park.

Americans do not see anything or anyone except what is infront of them.

They mind their business most of the time.

In Nigeria...

Women will look at the bikini clad lady under the sun reading a book and pronounce her a "loose woman" "No shame" "Endtime behaviour" "Husband snatcher" etcetera etcetera...as they pat their ugliness and douse this "evil situation" with a pack of praise to a god that hates the bare skin of women.

Nigerian men will stare, unable to remove their gaze...barely able to make any coherent sentence or focus on anything else. Their eyes will keep returning to the buttocks, and finally a few daft words...

"All this women...who will marry dis one now?"

He will hiss, hiding an erection fighting for room space, begging to grow to the size of an iroko tree. Ignoring the plea from its master to be humble in the face of evil.
