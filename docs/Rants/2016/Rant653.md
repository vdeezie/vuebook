A teenage girl could try many things- especially in her late teens...

Drink a glass of wine with 3% alcohol every other weekend.

Own gorgeous lingerie. 

Obsess over her hair.

Ask for red lipstick and 5" heels...

But the idea that it is ok to have a boy as a bestfriend...is stretching it a bit too far.

I am of the opinion that as long as your sexual organs are different, you can't be best of anything. 

I would appreciate if she was actually dating the boy than be made to believe that bullcrap of chummy friendship with the opposite sex. 

If we imagine that the guy is a good boy...how about the friends he rolls with?

What are their thoughts on a girl being their friend's best pal?

Wouldn't there be a misogynist in the group? A sex opportunist?

What kind of performance do we endorse when young girls present young boys as bestfriends?

Men and women can do whatever the heck they want, they are adults...

But impressionable girls should stick with their gender. It's not the easiest people to get along with, but the chance of being sexually assaulted is low.

Have we not heard of male besties who rape their female friends in bushes, after tricking them through a path for many years? 

(Watch the play "Hear Word")

Ever heard of male bestfriends who drug the drinks ordered by the female bestie when she heads to the bathroom?

I knew of a girl who was raped by her best friend in a hotel. 

They had been friends for many years. Through secondary school. Through university.

The day finally arrived when she would leave Lagos to Benin for a job offer.

Bestfriend was going to see her to the airport... but first, bestfriend wanted a proper farewell- drinks at a nice hotel.

The drinks were brought to a room, he locked the door, and raped her.

Zipped up and left her soaked in her own tears.

They'd known eachother for two decades.

It isn't proper to reduce people to their sexual organs and needs...

But it's a crazy world. And trust shouldn't be so flippant. But it is. 

As long and that penis can rise...teenagers can be anything from classmates to casual or academic friends with the opposite sex...

But you are not bringing a boy to my house and telling me crap about being bestfriends. 

Girl, you've got breasts. You'd want to take your bra off. Breasts bop. Breasts turn men on.

You're going to wrap a towel around your chest. Change your panties. Your butt will bounce in silk underwear.

No?

Boys cannot be your bestfriends. 

You see that only on Disney Channel.

In the real world, he shouldn't be allowed into your bedroom or be home alone with you...

Privileges bestfriends of same sex can enjoy.

PS: these are rules for teenagers, adults can do whatever the hell they want.

So don't let your 15 year old niece get away with that innocent crap about getting along better with men *roll eyes*.

They can take advantage of her.

Did you not hear about the young girl who was raped by some boys at a park?

Ok that was in Sefi Atta's book.

But you get my drift?
