So I bought this CD from the bookstore a fortnight ago.

The girls and I went book shopping. And, well, the CD was there.

I stopped going to church over 4 years ago. My kids don't go to church either. 

We pray in the mornings. And they study CRK in school. And I continually guide them on what is right and what is wrong. That's enough, really. 

I don't want children who'd grow up saying things like...

"God made women lower than men. He made her from a man's rib. She is man's helpmeet. That's the truth"... with the kind of idiotic audacity of fools.

I will slap that madness out of any of their mouths before it destroys their life or make a mess of their future. 

I am certain you do not need religion to teach your children about morals.

I don't like religion. I don't understand why I have to listen to a pastor flawed as I am preach to me his own version of Christ, buttered with his biases and limitations. 

I am aware many people do not go to church for the pastors (unless they are in adulterous rendezvous)...

Like weddings, 50% of the crowd do not go for the couple. They go for the jollof and the alcohol and the live band.

Nigerians don't go to church to meet God per se; they go for camaraderie, for fashion, for gossip, for the live choir. 

I will not open my children to a world where they have to look up to a man of god.

There's no human being higher than me in their lives. Period.

There's no uncle to rush to for advice like I am some helpless woman...seeking for a "male figure" to save her life and the lives of her children. 

It is not rocket science...children will obey if you make the rules and state the consequences.

I got the CD because a bit of CRK class would be cool to see in pictures. They are cartoon slides and pretty cool.

I didn't grow up in a religious home. My mother doesn't go to church. I found church on my own after tertiary institution...bored and searching. 

I sighted a fellowship...and that was it.

I did years of churching. And I was finally able to admit that churching is not my cup of tea.

Now I can move on with life...happy that I had that experience...and happier that I do not need it.

Eventually my girls will make up their minds.

But no. No quoting the bible for every simple decision.

If you want a job, go and get it.

You want to pass an exam, go and read for it.

If you want to build an app that can read people's minds, go and do it.

No fasting and praying and pissing all over common sense. 

God is there. And He is rooting for you.
