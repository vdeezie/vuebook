Hey God! 

My NEPA bill has risen to N85,000.

When I travelled, I stopped paying. I was upset. All the while i was away, no light.

Everything in my fridge went bad when I returned. I was away for just two weeks.

There was hardly electricity for four months. But the bills kept coming.

So now, they provide light at night for 8 hours till morning. 

They've been consistent with this stratagem for three weeks... because they need to make this performance so they have a reason to harass us later to pay up!

What about the bills piled up for months that I didn't get any light? 

What about months where I couldn't iron my dress or ice my water? Months that I couldn't cook because there was no method to store meals?

Those dark months that I watched the bill rise to over N70k and I refused to pay because there was no light?

Why should I pay N85k or more to NEPA for months that I survived by the grace of generator?

How about the delay in fixing my pre-paid meter? 

I have to move house. I have school fees. Rent. Transport. Two kids. One mother. Skin care. Food. Life...

All of these require financially attention.

Yet Nigeria is making up more reasons to envy the dead.

Is this life?

If I want justice for unreasonable electricity bill... 

Where do I go?

Any speedy court hearing anywhere in this land of darkness?
