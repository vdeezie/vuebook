Women are in the dark corner of religion's cul-de-sac.

So you are instructed to submit. Yet you do not have the authority to choose whom to submit to?

You still have to wait for a man to approach you. From the bundle of whatever brand of men come your way, you get to choose?

This is plain stupid, don't you see?

That you have to submit to what is available is how slaves are treated. A slave doesn't get to pick her master. She is tossed to any home and is ordered to work.

A freeborn is free indeed. There's freedom of expression, freedom to choose.

Not when it comes to women and religion. No.

It may be that there's a man you like... but religion says you cannot approach him. So you wait and pray, but since he isn't clairvoyant it never happens. In the midst of what is then available you have no choice but to pick and submit... all the while wishing some other dude had asked.

A woman can choose anything... work hard and get good grades and a good job and determine her own success. But when it comes to something as ordinary as wanting the man she wants... something extraordinary happens- she consults people she is probably smarter than to ask for advice. They then tell her to, err, "wait on the Lord to speak to him".

Or in other ridiculous instances, "shrug it off." Shrug the feeling off and consider any of the nitwits cramping your space.  

Women, who put those shackles on your ankle?

Whatever we need to submit to, we must have the power to choose.

We choose our leaders by voting. We choose the school we want to hand the care of our children to. We choose the restaurants we want to eat in. We choose the countries we want to visit (then obey their laws). We choose the jobs we want.

We choose. 

At the clock of 18, you are free to leave the family you never got to choose and make new choices. 

You choose.

If at all women have to submit, then women should have the right to choose the men they wish to submit to.

You can't tell me that I am only entitled to pick from the numbers that come my way. What if I don't like any of them? What if I think their heads need to be examined? 

What if I believe I deserve better?

Unless you are profiting in some ways from religion as a woman... I am surprised that any woman with half a working brain still takes this shit seriously. 

Now I hear that churches do not endorse court and traditional weddings. If you are not joined on the pulpit of your Ferragamo wearing pastor (or whatever cheap alternative your tithes can afford him), your marriage should not be consummated.

Really? 

Bhet... I thought God was everywhere.

You know?
"For in Him we live and move and have our being..." Acts 17:28

Isn't Jesus supposed to live in you? 
"Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you?" - 2 Corinthians 

“That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.” - Ephesians 

So what the fuck are these thieving people talking about?

And where was it stated that a woman shouldn't find her own man? Is there anywhere God punished a woman for finding the man she wanted? 

I mean... there are terrible negroes out here. How am I going to wait like a damp cloth on a rope hoping to get dry...waiting for an average man to ask me out. 

What kind of wretched position is that? There's no honour waiting to be toasted by a man you'd rather have a lazy conversation with over drinks and be done with.

Religion is cruel to women.

But thankfully Nigeria is not a religious state, you can go against every grain of crap and use your thinking head. 

It's like a horse tied to a broken chair. It is not really in shackles, it just doesn't have a brain that works.

If you are not too timid or afraid or just too plain a Jane to think you can't get what you want... stay there and be dulling.

Free yourself from primitive shackles abeg.

Life's short. Be excited by the choices you make- from the job you enjoy to the (kind of) man you adore.

PS: I have attached the mental shackles weighing your senses down. Just so you know.
