The Nigerian sits in his "abroad" home. 

WiFi. Electricity. Gadgets. Weather. Calm.

No generator blasting cells in his brain to pieces. No heat that makes you think of your skin as a cardigan that needs to be discarded.

No PHCN with N50k bill for eight hours electricity for the entire month. 

The Nigerian sits in his "abroad" home...

Switches on his laptop. 

Finds pictures of "poverty Nigeria".

Asks for lunch. Eats lunch. Cleans mouth.

Goes back to laptop. Winces. 

And starts to rant:

"What are NGOs and feminists doing about many-poor-women in Nigeria? I am ashamed of this country. Ashamed of anyone who can eat three square meal a day when shit like this is happening. Ehn?! What a disgrace, all of them. When are they going to save that country?"

Oga, what are you doing abroad?

Will you not bring your coconut head down here and save your country too?

Is it to sit behind a laptop like a coward and send us off to war? 

Won't you bring your ass down here and fight this shit too?

Come and see how "easy" it is to survive the daily hustle in Nigeria...and how we all transform to Superman the next minute to defend "poverty".

YOU and your agbalumo head sitting in the comfort of "abroad"...

What the fuck are you doing in another man's country?

Why are you not here to fucking save the many-poor-women 

Why are your children not here? Why have you not yet traded the sanity of a first world nation for the shit of your third world country?

Or why don't you just speak directly to politicans; the ones who can truly save a nation and all the "poor" and "raped" in society. 

Biko, pack yourself down here and come and change whatever it is you think needs to be changed.

Or wait for us to join you over there. Let us all compose beautiful sentences from our waterbeds abroad.

Everytime you see a woman romancing poverty, you start to masturbate on Feminism. 

Are feminists the first citizens of Nigeria? Are there cat suits we get the minute we step up to the title? Suits that give.us magical powers to save the earth?

You think our kids don't deserve 24-hour electricity like you enjoy? 

I ask again: what the fuck are you doing on your waterbed in a first world country, analysing the woman selling corn near a gutter belching of diseases in Makoko?

Will you not hurry down here and save her from a plague?

Ndi ara.
