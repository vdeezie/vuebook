That was how I was sitting jejely minding my business, when a rookie came to my table.

I have never met a rookie who looked so rookie. You know that cat meme that shows the "aww" look of a cat right before it goes gangsta...before mastering the art (good or bad) of its profession?

Yes, that look that calls for empathy. 

He had it.

"Good evening, ma'am. Please what will you like to have?"

I wasn't hungry. I was going to tell him I wasn't hungry.

"Today is my first day at work, but I'm going to serve you like a pro, I promise."

He got me there!

I turned to really look at him.

Young. Male. Probably 22.

Let's make his first day at work count then, shall we?

Ok.

Na so I order fish peppersoup and rice.

I wasn't hungry. But someone must be hungry around here. Someone I know. 

Nor be Freedom Park? I always meet people I know.

Yay! Two "fans" approached me.

Oya sit down make we chop fish peppersoup. 

It seemed they too weren't (that) hungry. 

First-day-at-work appeared, after "fans" had done their best with the meal- fish head still intact, my plate still full of rice, the tail end only half eaten.

"You didn't eat!" He was genuinely shocked and worried. 

"No. But why should it matter? You made three thousand six hundred naira for your boss...on the first day at work," I said.

He smiled.

I knew the smile came straight from a place of gratitude.

That was enough.
