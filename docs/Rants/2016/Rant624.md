I don't know about y'all...

But if anyone kills my father...

Driving under the influence of alcohol or influenced by bad brakes (go with your own narrative as you please)...

I would want justice.

Justice wouldn't mean jail term at once, it would ensure that the state treats my case with as much importance as it should.

I have to feel like I am not a casual fill-in for people's egotistic proclamation for compassion. 

In this case, I - the bereaved - have to show compassion to the character involved in the drunken and/or brake-failing episode that led to my father's death. 

Why do Nigerians ask for compassion from the one who bears more pain?

Shouldn't the state show more compassion by ensuring someone pays for the death of a human life?

Justice should ensure that I am not treated as subhuman in a case that involves a richer and/or more popular and/or more "loved" *roll eyes* individual.

Justice would require respect for my loss by the state without unecessary interference from gaudy red-carpet wannabes.

When we keep clapping "praise God" in defence to Ibinabo...

We deliberately declare the family of the deceased as insignificant. 

"All humans are equal. But some are more equal than others." Is truly the mantra of Nigeria. Check every aspect of the Nigerian life.

Amazing how we want sexual abusers to face justice...even when they plead intoxication as cause...

But when it comes to a life taken, people want a way out for Ibinabo.

Is rape more tragic than death?

I hate comparisons.

But if your activism loses its tang when your friend or colleague is involved...

Then you are a fraud. 

People even dare to analyse the emotional status of the bereaved family.

How can you possibly tell if they have "forgiven" or "moved on" or "seem to be coping well"

Are you some kind of therapist on hard drugs?

Is it a cracked smile from a wife or submerged silence from a son that you noticed in a photo-op that gives these conclusions?

What place do you stand to make such judgments for a family who lost one of their own?

Do we even think of how these "thank God" messages for Ibinabo's bail affects this family?

You and your ordinariness...have you thought of how you would respond if your husband never made it back home? Killed by a "celeb"?

And the desperation of the world to watch you move on quickly so the celeb can be in another trite movie?

How hard is it to think?

Think of the other person...

And how your prejudice affects them.
