Chacha.

It is why I insist that Nigerian women must be judged. Any judge-free platform cannot give you freedom.

You are a slave to your emotional needs. You are in chains. These tea-party groups are the paracetamol a quack doctor gives you to cure cancer.

Women, be the Christ who takes the pain and the nail and the beatings and the death...so that the next generation of women can have a better understanding of life...of making better choices. 

Your choices are bad. They are mediocre. They are disgraceful.

And to pamper these choices under the umbrella of a no-judgment forum is the height of madness.

You need to be judged.

I judge you. 

For all the poor choices you make.

How a woman stays in a marriage where she is aware that she is going to be killed, yet stays...

I judge you.

-Because your daughter will inherit this second-class living under a man and pass it on to her daughter...

So even in death, you are alive, and still making bad choices.

It never ends.

I judge you. 

Break your teacups and put ashes on your heads.

These women are a disgrace. 

Say it to yourself...

I am a disgrace for putting everything that I am beneath a man. Everything that I could be.

For living beneath my God-given abilities. For wasting my talent, my strength.

I judge my options everyday. I may not be able to totally erase disrespect from people... but I do not accept disrespect from a man for too long.

We need to start teaching the teenagers not to waste 26 years of their lives being manipulated and used.

Judge yourselves. 

And save the girl child.

Is there no end to these inanities?
