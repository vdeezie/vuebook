I cannot get over the fact that I share the same world with women who spend time wondering if it is ok to...

1. Buy a washing machine to wash Oga's clothes OR use bare hands with harsh detergent.

2. Serve Oga his meal every night OR allow the maid to do so. 

3. Own a property OR allow culture dictate her rights. 

4. Accept the job in Antarctica OR stay with Oga to attend to his immediate needs.

5. Confront the cheating husband OR attack the mistress. 

I am in the same world with these women.

And I have come to accept that it is ok.

I think you are stupid. But it is ok. 

I have built walls even higher on my 39th birthday.

If you are not a forward-thinking woman with a passion for something else order than a man bestowing you with life...

If you, as a man, are not gender enlightened and involved in new thinking...

I do not want to see you near my wall.

Do not leave messages in my inbox asking me daft questions on whether you should leave your husband after slapping you for the umpteenth time. 

Do not curse another woman living a golden life in my presence. 

Do not hate what you cannot achieve.

Do not fucking lie about what you are to appeal to society.

If you have to, stay away from anything that concerns me.

Stay away from me.

Die in your relationship. Grow old and wrinkly and starve yourself to death. Mourn the loss of a loser until you disappear into thin air. Write a long essay on Instagram and seek pity from the nooks of social media. 

I will read it up as fiction and move on. 

Because I think nothing of you, dear Nigerian anybody.

Thank you for your understanding.
