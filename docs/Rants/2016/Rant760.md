In sane societies, when you are sexually assaulted OR a case of murder...

The police is invited. 

Case don start be dat oh.

Let's imagine it happened in a hotel.

Prosecution and defense build their cases. They gather their witnesses- friends, family and neighbour's dog arraigned to testify. They invite the cleaners to take the stand and give their account of the incident. They talk to the manager of the hotel, the security guard, the last callers on both the victim and accused phones, they place calls to colleagues in their offices to build personality flaws or strengths for or against the case.

They fly witnesses in. They chase people from Mexico back to Chicago just to testify. 

They rely on forensics. DNA is key. Call records from telecoms. They enlist street criminals on probation to ask if they observe anything fishy in the neighbourhood during the time of the crime.

They'll question the tone of voice, body language, scratches or wounds if any.

Every table is turned. Every T crossed.

In Nigeria...

A 13 year old girl was raped. Her friend decided they should visit the Police. 

Just at the gate of the station, a policeman was leaning on the wall. He asked them what they wanted. They told him.

He looked the victim from top to bottom and said...

"Why dem go rape you? See as you be! Abeg dey go house."

The friend shared this experience at the "Orange your World" series last year in one of the schools I visited.

We organise Talk series, we hear the stories of children and women...

With their stories, we weave more talk and discussions. And I am tired of that. 

Tired of all the talk.

Tired and angry.

A child went to the police for help. She was insulted and turned back. That hasn't changed, but our talk sessions are getting more sophisticated. 

The seminars and the events do not change their reality. 

We are in deep shit.

Go and listen to that sick joke Okey Bakassi shares over and over and over and over and over again whenever he manages to climb a podium.

That is how we handle rape here.

Don't ask me what the joke is. He has trademarked it. It is designed to make a depraved society laugh.

And they always do.
