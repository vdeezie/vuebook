Lagos to London: Nigeria's new super rich.

I caught it on Thursday night on BBC. 

Amongst the typical oasis in the desert situation that leaves your soul beaten, one situation stands out...

Toke Makinwa is listed as one of the New Super Rich of Nigeria. 

?????

I know we don't talk about these things because the easy answers when you ask these questions will move from: "It is God" to "Why are you hating?" in a nanosecond.

Lifestyle journalism is dead in Nigeria anyway... if it wasn't, we would have proof of this wealth. 

In many countries, except you are inheriting a billion dollars of your father's wealth with your sibling (like Cuppy), people's wealth are scrutinised by police and press.

In Nigeria, we warn ourselves not to do any research.

It is why, in the UK, church wealth can be questioned and pastors invited over for interrogation at the police station.

In Nigeria? You are advised not to query the man of God. 

Toke, in the documentary, flies first class. She has two stylists- one in London and another in Paris, I think.

She shops with £5,000 (five thousand pounds) in a designer store. She is obsessed with shoes; and shoe-obsession is a pretty expensive venture.

How does a radio presenter, a TV co-host, an ambassador of payporte and a few other fledgling brands become one of the Super Rich Nigerians?

It is not hate to ask these questions. We have totally lost the fibre of curiosity that allows for growth in a society. 

We are not allowing our children ask questions. We shut them down with monosyllables and disgraceful clichés of "God's doing" and "minding your business"...

But beyond encouraging a mind that thinks, proffering solutions and creating opportunities, asking questions is what is needed to solve all of life's problems. 

It is in Nigeria that a 75 year old woman will give birth to triplets and everybody rejoices.

How does a 75 year old woman give birth?

Question this "miracle" and the pack of mentally indolent Nigerians will bark at you.

A man who couldn't hold a job in Nigeria... heads to Ukraine, and in another two years he builds a twin mansion in his village....

Nobody, not even his parents, will have the nerve to question his "success".

Why are we this way?

See the Nigerian child... always unsure, lacking curiosity, afraid to ask questions, unable to hold or hug a conversation, not seeking knowledge... because his parents are just the same.

Just know that as long as we are a religious society we will never be able to develop. 

I know this is supposed to be a simple post on: "how did Toke become 'super rich'"?

Is it a director's sloth, lacking real content, to put her in? Or is she really "super rich"?

Questions: "matter requiring resolution or discussion" is an act missing in our social interaction and construct. 

And it is a sad shame.

I have said it once or maybe twice that Toke is an amazing woman. She knows her audience and she feeds that audience which in turn has financial rewards and fame.

I know it is beyond our collective intellect to like someone yet be able to critique certain aspects of their lives. When we do, we cause a brawl and throw the baby with the bathwater. 

Can we just accept that we are a failed nation because of this attitude?

I wanted to end this by saying I am happy for Toke; but that would be so silly, as it will align with the sick religious triadition that I despise.

Of course I am happy for her. Her book, On Becoming, is about to change the way people read. She will be contributing immensely to a reading culture in need of oomph. 

It still wouldn't serve as a rejoinder for the Super Rich tag.

Because nobody becomes super rich running a morning show on radio, co-hosting on TV, and branding slim tea and payporte and other such products; getting paid for appearing on red carpet et al. 

Super rich is not millions. It is assets, structures, businesses... or affiliations by blood or law to owners of these empires.
