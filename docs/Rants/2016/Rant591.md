I was walking to the bus stop to catch a bus to the business caf√© where I was designing another edition of my community magazine, Festac Breed...

When my water broke.

So I took the bus instead to the hospital. 

Delivered my baby. Gathered our pennies and paid. And went home two days later.

#

The second delivery was by midnight. And by 9am the following morning, I was back home.

But that is not what I want to talk about. 

I want to talk about the day I was sitting in my office...

At the front desk, where my assistant usually occupied.

A client from Bond Bank walked in. I had been to his office once to drop a proposal for advertisement in my magazine. 

I smiled. Stood up to shake his hands...

But he grabbed me and kissed me.

"Come nah. I want you nah. Please nah. Kiss me. Please. Please."

I was shocked. 

I pushed him away and announced his presence. He walked in to meet my (ex)-husband...

I was still trying to understand what that was all about when I heard him say...

"Where's your wife? She didn't come to work today?"

"But you met her in the front office. That's her."

"Oh shit," he said. And then: "I am so sorry. I thought you were the other lady. The receptionist."

This was 2006, I think. I was still society's good girl. I wanted to please. I wanted to be liked. I wanted people's endorsement.  
So I laughed and told him not to worry. I was just glad he thought I was someone else...and wasn't trying to seduce me.

I told my (ex)-husband what happened immediately he left. 

And we both laughed. No biggie.

But you see...that was so wrong.

The fact that he wanted to forcefully kiss my 18 year old assistant...

Someone he couldn't even recognise in broad day light!

This man was the manager of a bank!

Yet, I didn't think much of it. I was just relieved it wasn't me he really wanted. And it was all a big mistake. 

Both men kept their friendship...and I even entertained him and his family during one festive season.

That man is capable of molesting subordinates, maids and random anybody.

It is not ok. At all. 

He could molest your child. Your 13 year old girl with perky breasts who comes around to play with his own children.

He is despicable. 

And all I did was laugh. And sighed with relief that he was trying to molest someone else.

My patriarchal stupidities were disgraceful.

If it happened now, I would deal with it differently. 

Very. Differently.
