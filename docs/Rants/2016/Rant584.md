I'm still talking about Relationships.

Have you noticed (that) people don't date their friends?

There are great guys/women who are part of your life. They share in your career/business goals. They bail you out when you need it. They know you and how you most likely will respond to things.

They are the ones you talk to when you feel most insecure, most vulnerable. They know stuff about your health/family/life issues...

They check up on you via sms, even at odd hours. They remember you when opportunities come knocking.

They've seen you angry, crazy, paranoid...happy too. In your best and worst form they stay and are part of your journey. 

They celebrate little successes. They know your schedules. Calendar activities.

They genuinely follow up on what is required to make you better.
 
They know when to be your hero. When to be the chief whip in your life. Tell you how they feel about certain slips you've made...without hurting the friendship. 

They are INTERESTED in who you are.

You leave all of that care and genuine love and show of affection...to date a stranger...

Because you like the curve of his/her lips.

I know I always come up with these weird thinking...but indulge me for one minute...

Why do we leave people who truly care about us and show it in many ways, and go out of their way to stamp their presence in our lives...to date someone else?

Why do we choose partners totally absent from our realities? People who wear the title like a garotte around their necks, about to choke.

We place fluff over substance. 

We are not 21 anymore. 

Shouldn't you be dating your friend?
