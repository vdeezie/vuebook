I had to slay a few beliefs recently.

I picked up my girls from school sometime last week when Ife muttered a word...

"Aramena"

Me: What's that?

Ife: A name.

Me: New kid in your class?

Ife: No. It's the name of my daughter when I grow up. I'm sampling names.

Me: Why don't you sample names of businesses you'll own instead.

Ife: Why?

Me: Because I bet not many kids are sampling names of businesses.

Ife: But I don't know what I want to become just yet.

Me: That is ok. And it also explains my point further. You'll have to know what you want to become FIRST before you bother about the name of a freaking child.

Jolade: Mummy! You cursed! When are you going to start paying us as we agreed for every curse?

Me: Sorry, Jolade, we will get back to that. As I was saying Ife...

Ife: Yes?

Me: You cannot be thinking of the name of your child when you are just 11. That's a bloody waste of your time. Think about something else!

Jolade: Mummy! You cursed again! That's one hundred thousand billion naira!

Mummy: Jolade, I am sorry! What kind of money is that anyway.

Jolade: Money for cursing. 

Mummy: Ok. Sorry. Please let me finish with your sister. Keep counting the curses but don't distract me please. You hear? Sorry. I will pay.

Jolade: Ok! 

Me: So Ife...where was I?

Ife: You said I should think of something else. 

Me: Yes!

Ife: Like what?

Me: The cities you need to visit. The careers that intrigue you. The businesses you may be interested in. I'll get you a diary so you can start putting ideas down. Even if they don't exist. Think of what you'll like to bring to the world.

Ife: Why can't I just think about a child I want to have?

Me: Because you are too smart to spend time thinking about something any dummy can think about. It takes no skill to get a child. If you have a vagina you will...

Jolade: Mummy! Vagina!

Me: Jolade for god's sake, Vagina is not a curse word. It is an appropriate word. Leave me alone.

Jolade: Mmphmm!

*Now wait for this part...

Ife: But Mrs. Nwogor said it is important for us to think about our children

Me: Who the hell is Mrs. Nwogor???!!!

Ife: My teacher.

*I exhale. I inhale. I exhale. I inhale*

Me: What da fuck!!!

Jolade: Mummy!!!

Me: You mean your teacher put you up to this?!!

Ife: Yes. It was Social Studies class and one of my classmates asked her, "is marriage compulsory?" And she said, "Yes. Else you will not be recognised in society."

*inhale. Exhale. Inhale...*

Me: Ife look at me. I am your mother. I give you everything. I pay your fees. You know me, right? You've seen me on TV. You've heard me on radio. You've seen me in magazines. You read my interviews. You know I spoke at Harvard right? Am I relevant?

Ife: Yes. You are.

Me: Are you proud of me?

Ife: Of course. 

Me: Why?

Ife: Because you love to live. You speak your mind. You are not afraid. You are always happy, playing music and dancing and travelling...

Jolade: And you take care of us.

Me: Thank you. 

*exhale. Inhale. Exhale...*

Me: Do you want to be like me or like your teacher?

Ife: Like you.

Me: So if I tell you what she said is a load of crap, will you believe me?

Ife: Yes.

Me: It is a load of crap, Ife. Your teacher is wrong. Say it. 

Ife: My teacher is wrong. 

Me: Get married if you want to get married. Have kids if you want to have kids. But don't let any fucking teacher tell you that your relevance has anything to do with a child or a husband.

Jolade: Mummy!!! You are cursing!!!

Mummy: I am sorry. God! Jolade! Your voice is too loud.

PS: I could easily edit the curse words and present this as crisp as people would want... But I am not perfect. HOWEVER, I fucking know what my child should be thinking about...and it cannot be thoughts on a husband or a child.

Fuck Social Studies! When was the last time this arsed government reviewed it's academic curricular? 

The world is literally falling apart. Policies are being made by world powers and are gradually eliminating blacks, segregation is blatant and scary even in first world nations...

Yet you have Nigerians still worried about the pet name to give a spouse and the names to give to their children!

When are you people going to wake up?!!

Please leave my children out of this madness. My kids are not even the next generation yet they have started sowing this retarded thinking in their minds. I did not deny myself all that I have for my children to start thinking about how marriage will keep them relevant.

Madam married teacher, are you relevant?
