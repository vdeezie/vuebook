We say this all the time...

What two adults do behind closed doors is nobody's business. 

I disagree.

If you fuck and have a child...

Many things can happen at that point:

If you are a bad parent, then the child may become anything from a terrorist, rapist, to a common thief.

It becomes the business of the rest of the world.

If your child is without an education, then it becomes our business. He will find a hundred vile ways to live. 

Crimes are committed by people who were once kids without proper guidance from parents who had no business having children. 

If your child runs after cars, pointing to his stomach, asking for a meal... you have failed him. He is now our responsibility. He becomes the project of the entire community.

We weren't there when the sex happened...when you were screaming and enjoying orgasms...but we are here to fend for and attend to the product from that action movie.

So sex cannot be your private business any longer when children from irresponsible parenting are killing, stealing, raping and terrorising the entire world.

If your child kills another human being. His crime becomes our burden.

Your sex is our business. 

Your penis is our business. And so is your vagina. And the pleasure that you derive from the exchange of fluids that take place during the act.

Except you have a condom... then you can have as many uninterrupted orgasms as you wish. 

If you want sex to be private...then don't bring kids into this world that will become all our responsibility or liability.

Fuck with sense. 

Save the world the horror of multiplying your kind (if you are irresponsible).

The world is going through all its devastating issues because people had unprotected sex privately when they should have been baking a cake...or something. 

Open your doors, please. Let us find out if someone like you should be fucking without condoms.
