In the defence of the Amber Roses and Blac Chynas of the world.

There are thousands of researches and articles to demonstrate how lyrics and music videos influence attitudes, and promote gender violence and misogyny.

Rap especially identify women as objects; electing body parts to represent the entire essence of a human being- in this case, a woman. The lyrics are hateful to women. Yet women are the leading vendors of hip-hop. They determine record sales, they consume the music, they feature and ensure that the videos portray them as boobs or booties or pretty faces.

Without women, there’d be no hip-hop. It’s interesting and confusing all at once. And it is why the revolution for gender equality will be the death of us.

Only a small percent of women truly desire equality. A staggering number want the status quo to remain… as long as they can hide under the idea of a “good man”, they can disregard the number of women under “bad men”, and overlook the society that refuses to bring to account these bad men… or religion that insists these unfortunate growing number of victims in intimate partner violence remain and “work it out with the power of the Lawd!”.

So once in a while, after brain zaps, you will find a musician, like Eldee, question the entire music space and the women who make these misogynistic sounds popular. After the birth of their own daughters, they begin to seek answers from within their own industry and the lingering theme of spent vaginae and valiant penises.

So it is fine to attack Amber Rose for making money and getting endorsements off a pretty face and drop-dead gorgeous body… but it is not ok to question Jay Z’s music or Kanye’s or Eminem’s and ask that their endorsements too face moral auditing?

In instances where the rapper is too tired to colour his misogyny with flowery words and exclaims bitterly how he is going to rape you from behind or drop a pill in your drink so your lifeless body can get a thrill of his dick… then, public outcry leads to corporate fangs tearing and chewing to pieces endorsement papers… which forces the artiste to retract his words.

Sigh.

Misogyny is never going to go away… because many women love being objectified. It is why they pump cement in the butt to make it bigger, or go for breast enlargement… anything to enhance certain parts of the body that can be sexualized. Full lips and all that craze.

I watched a video once where a woman said, "if I can't be beautiful, then I'll die trying"... after many cosmetic surgeries and bleaching efforts.

So Eldee and many of us have been crying out to the music of our preference to stop influencing our children negatively… but we forget another industry in entertainment that is just as guilty of damaging the psyche of children –

The movie industry.

If you watch C&I as much as I do, you’ll discover that many Killer Kids are influenced and impelled by movies they watch to be violent.

Many times during police interrogation or questioning, murderous children (some as young as nine years old) confess to being swayed by watching The Godfather series or getting addicted to action movies or the character of one bad guy.

An episode I watched last week, was the true story of a group of boys who acted out the killings in a movie.

Movies inspire extremism and radicalism. It could be for good… but when it comes to children, it most likely will be for bad.

But... is anyone questioning Woody Allen or James Cameron?

Allen has a penchant for manipulative murders and how to carry out the perfect crime. How come we are not asking for his head as regards his art destroying our children?

Is movie more revered art than hip-hop?

So you see, art and entertainment will inspire your most powerful traits.

Personally, I have stopped “tuning to another station” when I find that my kids are watching a kissing scene. There’s not much out there in the entertainment world that will protect a child anyway.

They will hear Rihanna say “fucking”, listen to 50cent talk “bitch”, hear Minaj brag about “fat ass and big cock”…

Young adults want a Nicki Minaj booty as much as they want to handle the kind of gun Matt Damon flaunts in The Bourne series.

Unless you want to run out of the earth… there’s no way out of this debauchery.

Our job as parents is to continue to whisper to our own kids and those around us the things they need to filter in a world full of many options but little value. 

It is not the job of the entertainer to think of your child.

And when an author writes a bestseller with many raunchy paragraphs of sexual depravity… it will not be her/his job to ensure your kids don’t find the book.

I have stopped growing grey over these matters. When my kids bump into these scenes or videos at the salon whilst making their hair (especially desperate scenes performed by women and their endless need for a man to scratch an itch) or in a device… I explain as clearly as I can to protect their innocence.
