I don't want to argue about this because the result is as appalling as politicians and their defenders.

The affection many people feel for Wole Soyinka is retrospective. He was part of our growing education in secondary school, and irregular banter on the beer-drinking table of our fathers and their friends. 

To retain his contribution in memory would be to consciously seek to do so.

When you are raised in a third-world country, grappling with every comfort, begging your sense of pride not to slip from the grasp of middle-class amnesia... it is almost impossible to remember what anyone stands for, apart from the drudgery of your parents and international activists.

We recall the deeds of people from first world because there's a reservoir of fine history to preserve memory and dying tastes. 

You don't have that in Nigeria. 

We don't have museums furnished to contain the history of the people who have changed society. 

So what you get is people modeling their lives after the nearest garish individual: a neighbour with vulgar display of wealth or an uncle with a gaudy sense of accomplishment.

No substance. 

Substance is intentionally preserved, marinated or embalmed. It is a deliberate act done by a society that cares about heroic activism. 

Nigeria is not one of those countries.

I watched a South African documentary once. It was the death of Nelson Mandela. 19 and 20 year olds were asked about Mandela's contribution and courage...

And these youngsters had very little to say about this great man. A man who made it possible for them to go to fancy schools, buy frozen food at supermarkets, use toilets without race tags. A man who gave them freedom.

It could mean that South Africans have not protected the history of Mandela... and have failed to pass it down generations.

With history as a subject scrapped from our academic curricula, you'd be crazy to think my children will remember what the heck Soyinka is about. 

I am not even fully convinced of his valour in activism or statemanship beyond uneasily readable internationally approved texts.

But that is not what this post is about.

What grates me about this discussion is how terribly parochial the conversations have become.

The disgraceful decline, not from the minions, but from those who stand on the side of criticising and derobing Soyinka of lofty titles and achievements. 

By all means do. Do it through proper arguments.

But when you say something like:

"I don't even know what is so special about that man. They only thought (sic) me one of his poems in school. He should go and sit down somewhere."

By God, you are reprobate, degenerate even. And you have reduced this conversation to scum.

You are the biggest problem to society (not Soyinka's bloody inconsistencies).

Like everything Nigerians touch, you have infected this very important conversation with vermin.

And it is just tiring. Nothing grows in this country because of people like this. They will drag everything into the depth of infinite stupidity. 

And they say these things with such unenviable aplomb.

Tufia kwa!
