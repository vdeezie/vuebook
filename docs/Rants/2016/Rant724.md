My daughters cannot stand birthday parties.

They have been to probably four birthday parties their entire life.

They don't enjoy it. 

Nigerians have no clue what to do with children. We have no idea about children entertainment. Children do not like all that organised shouting and jumping. 

"Sing 'happy birthday', oya!'" The bloody uneducated bully in a costume orders the kids... and at once, they all start to sing. 

"The loudest singer gets a pack of biscuit. Oya sing and shout!" The MC/clown has white chalk marks on his face and a dirty hat. His partner is Barney- the Nigerian version, skinny with a potbelly and without the sheen; it needs a bath.

The children shout and sing out of tune. You panic, afraid one of them will vomit his/her intestines.

(After the party, their voices grow hoarse. Temperature follows. Malaria drug is next for three days).

Next, it's time to win a biro and a lollipop; they go round a few chairs, guided by music. When the song stops, they place their bottoms on chairs. A loser emerges... and on and on until after 30 tiring minutes, a child wins a wretched gift. 

Then the hustle for food, mere jollof rice that they eat everyday, appears in plastic bowls with a piece of meat and hot coca-cola bottles tossed at them like expired goods.

Then "dance dance dance". Music that describes how to sleep with a woman when she says "no"... how to buy her a Bugatti when you want to toast her... and all other absurdities. 

Your children are shaking their bombom to these lyrics.

It's ridiculous because this is the only entertainment for children of all ages. From 3 year olds to 12 year olds... 

It is the only entertainment for poor kids and middle-class kids. And we expect them to enjoy this annoying performance regardless of social class.

My daughters cannot stand birthday parties. They can't stand the shouting, the competition, the dancing, the gifts. 

They can't stand the adults either, taking all that space, gisting and making a reality show of the kids.

Once Ife looked at a 3 year old celebrant and said...

"She cried all through her birthday. In fact half the kids cried all through this birthday. The adults are just chatting and eating. The music is terrible. The MC has bad breath when he came close to me. Why do we bother with these things?"

We agreed we would stop school parties too. Because there was some kind of contest on whose parents could hold the baddest school party... and since I have other important things to do with my time and money and no interest in competing with ruby woo wearing housewives, we agreed we shall celebrate birthdays at home and send a piece of cake to grandma. 

It's been four years since we made that decision... and nobody died. 

My girls like visiting the movies. Our cinema culture is lit. 

If anyone will invest in children's entertainment in a place like Lagos, they'll make a killing... the success will be surreal.

Unfortunately, they don't give loans in Nigeria. So na siddon look we dey.
