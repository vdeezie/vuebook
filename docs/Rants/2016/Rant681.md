If Jesus had stepped into a hut no one else had entered... it would have justified pastors buying houses in the Bahamas.

If Jesus had displayed a new fabric that was made specially for him...it would have justified the flamboyant lifestyle of the pentecostal church. 

If Jesus had told the children he taught to go gather offering from their parents for the words of wisdom he shared with them...it would have justified the Christian schools with maddening fees.

If Jesus had a wife and she, by chance, grabbed the hem of her flowing dress...it would endorse by far the idea of submission as the rightful place of a woman. 

"She bowed before her lord." Every midget with a small dream will not let us hear word. (It's all Paul's fault)

Thank God Jesus scattered the traders at the worship centre... religion skips that part of the bible quite easily. Their stiff necks skip that conveniently to something else that can justify personal lust and avarice. 

All Jesus had to do was ride on a bloody "new" donkey, and they have used it to justify Range Rovers, private jets and a life of exasperating materialism.

The job of a pastor, like the original intention of civil servants before overwhelming and nonchalant corruption, is modesty. 

You cannot be in government and be so blatantly flamboyant, having a feast on people's taxes.

You can't occupy a position as a religious head and flagrantly use people's tithes and offering to furnish your greed.

If God was still interested in parting seas and opening the clouds to speak directly to man...

He would have revised the bible. Again. 

Changing times require new methods.

Because God knows the times would require a revision.

However God is consoled by one thing- you have a brain.

Use it.

A new donkey is not equal in value to a private jet.

It doesn't matter if it happened 2,500 years ago.

A new donkey is equivalent to a fucking brand new KIA at best. Or any brand of Toyota. Or even a Mercedes. Not a private jet. 

You know this. 

Jesus will not own a private jet in the midst of shameless corruption, injustice and terror of the magnitude our society suffers.

He won't do it.

And you know this.

And that is why religion is a hypocrite.
