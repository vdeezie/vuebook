Dear Facebook "friends",

I don't know how else to say this but...

Stop "fighting for me". I did not send you on any errand. 

Stop it. Stop fighting for me with that pretentious wit and ridiculous bants. 

If at all you want to STAND with me on a matter... then you have to come with the fire and shamelessness of Ifedimma Onwugbufor or don't come at all.

If you need to fight for me (whatever that means) you'll need the kind of fiery valour and audacity displayed by Viola regarding Charity's case.

You need to be resolute like Teetee in regards to where you stand.

If you can't be consistent, if you are constantly repentant...then remove my name from your mouth. 

I think you are an idiot. 

I don't do half measures. 

Let me tell you the kind of people you are...

Some of these fuckers abusing Linda Ikeji for instance... if she sends you a private invitation to her home or her party... you'd carry your legs to her house, eat her rice and repent immediately.

If she invites you to her office, you will run there and take a selfie and put on Instagram...

"Party at Linda Ikeji's. I got an invite. She is so amazing."

Whores. All of you.

You abuse her only because she doesn't recognise you to be anything except a head popping out of a million other heads seeking attention.

You call her scum only because she doesn't know you or regard you to be of any importance.

You are cheap. You belong in a crowd. And you are scum.

You only project onto her what you really are.

And if you had a blog that would require gossip to make you a billionaire... you'll do much worse than Linda could ever imagine. You'll live out every so-called evil you accuse her of.

I feel so sorry for people who live by the dictates of a million others.

A mass of nobodies. 

...

So back to Facebook "friends"...

Stop fighting your cute little fights on my behalf.

It makes me cringe.

I don't care. If it is not fire and sacrifice...you are wasting your time.

And I think very little of you and your "efforts".

The fact that you think I cannot see through your perpetual nonsense is what irks me the most.

Stop it. 

Your weak attempts at "saving Joy" is what kryptonite is to Superman.

Don't dull my brand biko.

That you are even on a mob thread talking like a weak piece of shit is not something I can ever endorse. 

Hate or love... I am still a god.
