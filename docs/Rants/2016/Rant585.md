It was in 2013 that someone mistakenly credited my account with one million naira. I shared the story then.

I had less than N30k in my account when that happened.

A former client. I knew it was done in error.

It was hilarious because I stared at the figure on my phone for so long it made me dizzy LOL! I shook myself back to earth and dialed her number.

She said it wasn’t from her account and no transaction had taken place. She even sounded like she was in a hurry...like I was wasting her time. But this was N1m in my account that didn’t belong to me.

I looked at the details of the alert again. It was hers. I called again. She said the same thing. "It is not from me", she was adamant.

“Madam B, your one million naira is sitting in my account. Transfer was done by your company. May be you should ask any of your vendors…”

And that was when she went… “Oh dear! It must be the bakery guy!”

She was starting a bakery business and made a transfer to the suppliers; except she didn’t make it to them, she made it to me.

Penniless me.

So she pleaded that I send the money back. 

Why she pleaded profusely, irritated me. I was the one who reached out over and over again before it clicked. Did she think I was going to change my mind and actually “eat” her money? LOL!

The next day I went to the bank to make the transfer. It cost me N3,212 extra to get it done. I sent her the receipt so she could see the extra money it cost. I would have left it, but I was broke. Every naira mattered to me.

She sent me back my N3,212 fee; no jara. LOL!

I was happy to be back to being genuinely broke without the veneer of “wealth”.

Something similar happened to me last week.

So I want to say thank you to the lady who sent back money that was mistakenly credited to her account last week. She was paid in error from a company account though she is no longer a member of staff.

She was the one who reached out to me to point out the error, and she sent the money back today without pressure.

I know it is not N1m, but I suspect that N70k she sent back could be as huge as N1m in her life at the moment.

I am not saying she’s poor or anything…I’m just saying that you get to some kind of financial gridlock and N10k can begin to look like N100m.

I have been saved by N50k before.

My friend Seun had saved me from the weight of school fees once. N70k it was then, and it was as huge as buying me a house in my sight.

It’s just good to know a young lady would do the right thing…even when she had every reason not to.

For your show of consideration, may you find favour in the eyes of the One who sees beyond human motive and endeavour.

I respect you.

PS: Please, I'll appreciate if I do not get Nigerian comments telling me what to do- "Why don't you give her back the money?" "Why don't you employ her?" "Eeyah! Joy please do something for her..." "I think you should give her half of the money to encourage her...yada yada"

Allow people do what they want with the testimonies in their care.

Thanks :)
