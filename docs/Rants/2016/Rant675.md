We are in a hotel, getting ready for a party. 

Prisca is wearing a black dress. I am teasing her about her tummy...

Then she says,

"Joy, dem remove me for FIN oh!"

"Huh?"

I did not know she was in FIN.

"You dey FIN before?"

"Yes oh. Person add me. I nor tell you. Because you nor send."

Prisca has never munched a conversation from any bloody cult to share with me.

I had no idea she was there.

Thinking about it makes me want to burst out laughing. 

Prisca was in FIN all this while.

And the cowards finally searched through their blackbook and took her out.

Why are you afraid of your shadows?

Hypocrites with draconian rules.

Everybody who isn't ready to suck a cunt is thrown out. 

If you are not licking the feet of the admin, out you go. 

And you say you are running a home of love for women.

You created that shithole for the sake of love?

Who are you fooling?

Nigerian women, who are you fooling?

I had that fight with one of your admins...(I warned the blockhead many times, she must have thought I am here to catch a bouquet)

I had no idea she was an admin at FIN until the messages started pouring in.

Your members are happy I slapped that pride off your face.

You must have been mistaking me for one of your members. 

You are running a bloody cult. 

Ugly things.

You failed where it mattered the most, standing up with the strength of 170,000 soldiers for the sake of Charity. 

You are more interested in blocking people who you think aren't going to suck a toe.

Wetin Prisca find go there sef?

Madam wetin you find go there?

Michelle Obama dey dia? 

Oprah dey dia?

Rihanna dey dia?

Serena dey dia?

Amanpour dey dia?

Leave this bandwagon mentality abeg.

Know what it feels like to be whole without the need of crutches or "religion".

FIN is a bad religion.

It's a hole for people in need of power they cannot find any other way.

I will make sure my daughters do not find the need to exist or find meaning in any kind of gathering that diminishes their individuality and threatens their unique voices.
