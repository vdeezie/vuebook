There's a story on Elsie's wall about a girl who left an abusive relationship in the wake of the hottest domestic violence news that led to death.

The woman chose to stay with a man who treated her worse than a doormat. Beat her. Raped her. Threatened her. Punched her. Raped her some more. 

And this woman, after years of abuse, "threatens" the man to marry her or the relationship will end.

LMAO! 

But the question is... do you get married to a doormat that you stomp your feet on? An item that carries your dirt with no dignity?

He said no. No marriage.

So she left. He got someone else. Tried that abusive shit with the new girlfriend. And new girlfriend broke his head.

The new girlfriend refused to love a monster. So old girlfriend came back, bailed him and continued in the abusive relationship she had left initially.

More beatings. Of course. He beat the shiznit out of her head some more. Raped her some more.

Finally, girlfriend leaves after seeing Ronke Shonde's body of unrequited love spread out on the floor. Swollen. 

That's her testimony. The end.

Everyone has something to say about the "useless man", "wicked man", "godless man".

We are trying to speak to men who LOVE hitting women? We are asking for repentance from men who LOVE to rape the women who choose to stay with them?

It's amazing how we ignore the elephant in the room.

Why are we so afraid to question the woman? 

What kind of mess are you that you stay with an abuser...and even ask that he marries you (which he turns down)?

What kind of insecurity are you made of that you are raped and abused for so long that you go back to the same vile man?

Let justice deal with abusive men.

Let us start to question these women.

We will continue to have these pitiful groups that patronize these privileges to be victims of abuse...

If we do not address the elephant in the room.

You people don't get it, do you?

Rapists, paedophiles, abusers LOVE what they do! 

It is time to question the demon that lives inside these women.

PS: That girlfriend will return to her abuser. Give it time.
