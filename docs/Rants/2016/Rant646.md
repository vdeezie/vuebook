I remember the day my ex-husband threw my things out on the balcony.

Boy! Was I glad!

I called my mother in a rush...

"Mummy, hurry! He threw my things out. This is the moment. Please come and carry me out of this house!"

You see, I needed my mother's approval because there was nowhere I could possibly stay. It had to be at her apartment.

Normally I wouldn't need anyone's approval. So there.

My clothes were dumped out the door like garbage because...

I refused to apologise to a taxi driver. 

Taxi driver was rude...I responded rudely too. 

But Oga of the house demanded I call the taxi driver to apologise.

I said that was never going to happen.

"You are a stubborn woman. We are not equal. You do what I say," he ranted as he threw my things out.

I waited patiently for my mum. Very happy. Maybe now she would let me go home with her. 

When mum showed up. She walked past me into the bedroom...

To beg the husband.

I was livid!!!

Smoke came out from my nostrils. 

My mother- the woman who built her own wealth and empire from scratch, begging a mere man.

I could taste anger on my tongue. 

She begged. He stretched himself on the bed and wouldn't even look at her.

I shook my head. 

I knew things could only get worse.

You never beg a man to keep your child.

Never.

But mum...Oh sweet mum, as tough as a lioness, wanted to do the "right" thing...

Please society. 

Very unlike her. She slays idiots, normally, with bare hands.

But here she was, trying to do everything to keep her daughter married. 

I shook my head. 

It would take another two years before she would finally LISTEN to me.

I want out! Helloooooo!!!

***

I have been to speaking engagements at Harvard and United Nations...

I work really late hours and make decisions. I head a company.

I exercise my liberties. 

I make my mistakes and own them.

It is my life. 

None of these would have been possible in that marriage.

It was not terribly violent, it was not crushing...I left before words would mature to disrespect and abuse...

But it was terribly average. Mediocre. Uninspiring. 

Today I watched a man beat his wife in public, and no one cautioned him.

The fear in her eyes, still haunts me.

I have cried for her and for every woman suffering abuse.

I don't know how anyone would choose that kind of life over "being alone".

Are you afraid of your own company? 

You have dreams to get a degree in Canada but ONE man tells you "no", and you sit in this dumpster called Nigeria.

You get a job to go work offshore, but ONE man says, "stay home", and you give up on your dreams. 

Is he giving up on his?

I am so sorry for the choices your marriages and relationships have denied you. 

One troll said Chichi Nnani and I are too angry...

"Nobody should be that angry," she said, sitting in the comfort ignorance affords her.

A man killed his wife and had the audacity to state the miserable cash he gives her to make soup.

Another beats his wife to death and mumbles on and on about adultery. 

This is why we are angry.

But you are a troll. You know nothing. 

Tonight, I will say a prayer for all the broken women.

PS: We will continue to share our stories to help other women find their voices and strength. 

We have conquered patriarchy in our own small corner.

So can you.
