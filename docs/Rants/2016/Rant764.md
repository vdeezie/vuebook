When the first hotel in Nigeria was about to be launched, the owner hurried to his pastor for blessings.

"Pastor, please bless my new business."

"What business is it, my sheep?"

"Err...it's a place for relaxation. A place for pleasure, for self-indulgences, for gratification."

"Wow. What place is this that sounds like heaven?"

"Oh...err..yes, it is some kind of heaven for mortals."

"What is the name of this business, dear sheep."

"It's...err..."

"Don't be shy, my sheep. Tell me."

"Pastor, it's a hotel."

"A hotel???"

"Yes, pastor. It's a hotel. But I need your blessings, sir. I want the business to be covered by the blood."

"Hmmm." (Pastor in deep thought; of the depth of a hole in a doughnut)

"Please, pastor. I need your intercession in the progress of the business."

"OK. But on THREE conditions, dearest sheep: You must pay your tithe..."

"Oh! But of course, Pastor! I shall even upgrade my building project pledge."

"Very good. How much is a room?"

"N45,000 per night for standard rooms."

"Shakatitboiatnokabhskssnyehen. The spirit says people of the same sex should not lodge together. If they must, increase the room cost. Their sin is greater."

"Yes, pastor."

"Roeubtakikabskteupylrunu. The spirits says your tithe must be 30% gross worth...for this choice of business is not totally pure."

"Yes, pastor."

"Woyutikoleburutiluloade.  The spirit also instructs that the big hall in the hotel must be made available for church services every Wednesday."

"Yes, pastor."

"And most importantly, dear sheep..."

"Yes pastor?"

"EVERY. ROOM. MUST. HAVE. A BIBLE. SITTING. ON. THE. LEFT. DRAWER. NEXT. TO. THE. BED."

"Amen, pastor!"

And so the tradition of the Bible in hotel rooms began.
