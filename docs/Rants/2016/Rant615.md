Nigerian women want to submit.

They want to cook and wait for a man to return home to a hot meal.

They want to wash oga's dross. 

They want to go on both knees to thank Oga for allowing them get a Masters' Degree.

They want to be able to call him "the crown of my head", "my king", "my world", "lord of my ribs"...

They want to bleach for his sake...add weight for his pleasure.

They want to be slapped around sometimes. 

They want him to choose everyday- "me or the other woman."

They want to fight for his love.

They want to be told to "resign from work and stay at home. Keep it warm for me, baby"

They want cultural restrictions. They want religious walls to protect them from the 'wild wild world' (let us pretend they weren't giving coprophilia for years *new word alert*)

They want to be told how dangerous it is to ride a bicycle...drive a truck...run a business. 

They want a man's covering.

They want to be applauded for fixing their own pipes and pulling a generator and changing the engine oil.

They want their men to be their biggest achievements...

And they want you to wail with them and carry placard on their behalf when he finds another lover. 

Dear feminists, don't stand in the way of Nigerian women.

Leave them.

Children. Focus on children.
