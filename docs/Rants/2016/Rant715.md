I could teach you a thing or two on how to reinvent yourself everytime a peasant blows dust your way...

But then you'd have to pay me.

I must first respect how you think and how you are able to put your thoughts into words... beautiful sentences.

And not many people can do that. 

So I keep my respect to myself... and continue to taunt as many people as I can just to watch them break into tiny pieces of rage.

Because I can.

And because people will always be people. Always quick to play the victim. Never smart enough. Too foolish to gather the full picture. Quick to lament. Mass hysteria. Use your brain, no.

People's responses are always the same without fail. 

They are going to try to get back at you by questioning your happiness or your vagina. 

It is always about a woman's vagina. 

And people with butter for brains think the vagina is a cool shaming tool.

Well, not to me. I am yet to have the sex I should be having sef.

Full vagina worship. Cunnilingus tripping. Body massage. Clitoris tickling. Ice cream on my nipples and shiiii. 

All of that and watch the vagina whistle in many languages.

How can you slut-shame someone who is thinking of old age and plenty sex?

I haven't yet lived the life to earn the prize. So keep it in the oven. Keep it hot. I'm coming for it. 

And then there's the Art of the vagina and the things we can do with it.

Enter #storyofmyvagina 

Uche Okonkwo's submission, Old Things, gathered over 3,000 views on www.happenings.com.ng 

One story in less than 10 hours. 

Please, bow down.

My assistant thinks I'm some kind of witch.

"How do you do it?"

Again, you'll have to pay me.

Then there's the editor, Temitayo Olofinlua who works harder than anyone I know. Committed to the projects she is commissioned for.

She is precious. The world will fall and I'll hold on to her hands abeg! For a woman who just gave birth... I salute her strength.

Our inbox is smelling of all kinds of Vagina. Hallelujah! Lol!

I'm just here to brand this project and create as many art forms to keep the vagina conversation going. 

This is 2016, if you don't have anything to say to  the next woman as a way to hurt or shame her and you think some bullcrap vagina woe would do the trick...

I am here for all that drama.

Put your finger in your own vagina and curse the god that made you a stupid woman.

How does something that gives pleasure be reduced to shame?

If you have a Vagina, stop thinking with your clits.

Use your head.

Recreate yourself.
