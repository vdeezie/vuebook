Just-because-you-blow-big-grammar-doesn't-mean-you-are-intelligent advocates are getting tiring. 

I mean, here I am with a bloody Ploytechnic certificate I am yet to use to my advantage for something as ordinary as a job.

Apparently I have stayed employed with just the words that fall out of my mouth and some kind of confidence I have built looking at the mirror and falling in love with the tip of my nose.

So what do I know about grammar and all that stuff? Absolutely nothing. I am still picking my sentences like a 5 year old picking her favourite alphabet cereals in her plate. 

But let me speak for the " English grammarians" who seem to irk the rest of the Nigerian population. 

Indeed, you need to speak alot of good English and write alot of great sentences to be intelligent, book smart.

Why?

In the four walls of structured and organised education that involves Science, Technology, Literature, Art, Mathematics, Biology etc...

We learn through the English language. We are illuminated and enlightened through the use of English language.

So there is every likelihood of not having new knowledge or civilised knowing if English is not a play thing in your palms you can toss around without fuss.

I am yet to find a child who is taught how to become a successful broadcaster in Igbo. Even if s/he will end up an Igbo speaking newscaster, they still get to teach her how to be a "great Igbo speaking presenter" in English language!

Street smart is another topic entirely. People can be street smart without a word of English on their tongue. 

Book smart however (which translates to career smart, first world smart etc), in Nigeria, requires plenty of English language, oral and written.

Most of your favourite works are in English; and all the authors you love probably write in English or have an English version of the acclaimed works. 

You will write your next CV in English... and if you can't sort out your prepositions for instance, you'll have to live with the fact that a potential employer may find you unintelligent. 

Sorry.

There's something I tell my children all the time:

"Be articulate. Don't blab on through a conversation. I want to hear you speak to my intelligence. Or lack of it."

Too many Nigerians cannot express their opinions eloquently in the only language they employ in schools.

Why?

They don't think in English. They first have to think in another laguage and then try to say it in a foreign language to people who are united by the foreign language. 

It is not your fault. And it hell isn't the fault of English grammarians. Don't be pained. 

Blame the system. Blame our affinity to voting in bastard rulers. 

It is tough. And that is why I do not joke with "grammarians". Especially the ones who can speak many languages and still hold brilliant conversations in English language. It is why I sit at Literary events to listen to smart people talk.

When Dbanj's Koko-something was broadcasted, that chick- Rita was clearly not going to go too far with English missing in her life. She gathered her fans, they cheered her on and told her not to bother about "speaking well"...  but soon enough they all returned to jobs and schools that require English as it's primary method of communication. 

She cannot be termed intelligent in many ways because we learn how to be intelligent by speaking and learning in English. The new society is built in English and other first world tongues.

Nigeria's 500+ languages are not included.

Again, sorry.

If you have to dismiss the English language, then you would have to work for the kind of development China, South Korea etc have acquired. 

In this rot of regressing shame called Nigeria, we remain slaves to a language many people have no master of.

You are in no position to shit on English language or people who play with it effortlessly. 

This doesn't in anyway take away the brilliance of culture.  

If Nigeria can make its own cars, its own planes, produce the raw materials for entrepreneurs to create local products...

If Nigeria can sort out electricity and alternative means of transportation. If we can brand our tourist cities and build sophisticated amenities...

If all of these can be achieved in new institutions of development where new knowledge and skills are taught through Ishan language or Itsekiri language... then by all means we can toss that "intelligent" grammarians of the English language to the curb, and gainfully employ any of the Nigerian languages as our lingua franca.

PS: I totally love English language. And I learn to do stuff with it by, well, reading up on articles by English grammarians.

Ose.
