Social media caterwaul is an exercise in futility. 

It's masturbation at best. It makes you feel good. Releases your own burden of setbacks and failures on cyber space that allows you to feign some kind of power or intellect.

But even you know you are still miserable. 

You still have to return to your house. Sit on your bed. Stare at your account balance. Mourn your bad choices. Grovel at those who can give you a piece of decency.

After twerking all over cyber space, sharing your opinion about someone else...

You'll still carry your CV and go and look for a job. And fail at the interview. And call your mother to borrow N10k.

Sometimes all you need to do is go through the FB wall of someone sharing an opinion about you.

Just go to their wall. So average you won't even hire them to serve tea in an office.

It doesn't matter what you say about anyone. The fact that you have a public opinion about them shows that you are not in anyway an important part of their lives, relevant to their pursuit or have the power to shade their sunlight. 

One time I watched a supermarket owner rush across the street, pick up a stick and joined a mob to beat up a man.

It was when he was done...with blood on his hands, and the victim whisked off by the police, almost charred to death, that he asked one of his kind...

"Wetin him do?"

"E thief."

"Ah! Ok."

He strolled back to his shop, wiping off sweat and blood on his khaki shorts. Me waiting at the door, looking at him like lucifer's cum. 

"My sistah sorry, wetin you wan buy?"

Just like that. Back to living his "perfect" life.

"What did you just do?"

"Na thief."

"You joined a sick mob to kill a man."

"Na thief nah! E nor die."

"Did you see him steal? Did he fucking steal your balls?"

"Eh? Sistah if you wan buy som'tin, buy!"

I did the proverbial shaking of sand off my feet and walked away.

That was many years ago.

He is still a shop owner. A small kiosk, totally unecessary in the bigger scheme of things in a neighbourhood with over 4,000 shops selling a variety of every lone product on his dusty shelf.

But ask him about Serena Williams...

He will tell you she is "Ugly". "Maybe a man". "Most likely has a cock". "Not beautiful". 

"In fact I have lost respect for her because she was twerking in Beyonc√©'s video"

You and your tiny supermarket kiosk (tiny cubicle, unsuccessful business, big nose..fill in the gap as it suits your brand of idiocy) has lost respect for Serena?

Go to her wall and see how they dissect her beauty. Go to twitter and read tweets from people who cannot pay their mortgage talk about her missing penis.

Come to Nigeria and see people trying to balance their account and about to have their fourth child on a N120k salary talk about losing respect for Serena for DANCING! 

If at all you have paid attention to public opinion of yourself...slap yourself right this minute. 

That's like allowing a conductor who spat "ashawo" at your direction for not "holding your change" to affect your day.

For god'sake he is a conductor!

Dignity of labour only applies when you honour your job by showing respect to customers.

The next time you find yourself the King in the centre of people's rage...

Think Serena.

It don' marra what ya think. Bae is great!

Great people cause outrage.

If you have a view of her underwear...it is important to state the fact- 

You are under. Beneath. Below. At the bottom.

What opinions you have of her pant, doesn't matter.

You are first under. And there you will remain so you can continue to spew opinions about things of no real value.

Tell your daughters about "Serena".
