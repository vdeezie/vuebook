You can always count on my forthrightness. 

I am too much of an unkind heart to keep a juicy thing like..."Your friendship is meaningless to me. Be gone..." away from you.

I will never need the assistance of another human being or lousy inbox nonsense to pass that kind of information.

You will hear it from my own lips.

You will see the words take shape on my tongue...

I. Think. You. Are. A. Disloyal. And. Confused. Friend. Your. Constant. Need. For. Validation. From. Every. Caucus. Irritates. Me. And. Makes. You. Look. A. Tad. Promiscuous. Like. You. Could. Carry. On. With. A. Messy. Orgy.

How hard can that be for a narcissist?

I do not need to pass that message through anyone else.

It will be right in your face.

You will not find me in anybody's inbox. 

That's beneath me.

I will say it and I will enjoy saying it. 

-Because for it to ever happen, you'll be deserving of it.

I don't gossip! I don't do inbox! 

That's cowardly.

If anyone tells you otherwise, they're lying.

I got rid of those kind of jokers a while back. 

As tight as I am with Temidayo, there's not one gossip thread on our private chats.

Heck, we don't have private chats! 

As amazing as I think Bimbola is...our chats are strictly on our careers.

Prisca...who in their right senses will gossip about me to Prisca?

Daft people everywhere doing daft things at every turn.

I don't build friendships on gossip.

And the minute I realise you are just a whore in friendship...

I'll smack that one dollar on your ass and walk away.

Isn't that what it's all about?

The shit you can get from every camp you lay your back on?

Trust me, I will tell you what I think about you.

I will. Trust.

No time.
