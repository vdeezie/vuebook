I don't understand how a relationship could be all about sex.

You fuck...then what? 

You fuck the next day.

You keep fucking like freaky teenagers.

Looking at the ceiling after sex, making conversations that die as fast as the high you just experienced.

You will just be fucking everyday. 

You are an adult. If you can't have a relationship where there's an exchange of ideas, wealth, thoughts and plans...

Then what you probably have is a one-night stand.

Only difference is you are having it with the same person.

There are people who I've had discussions with...and they misinterprete some of the things we write.

I will beg you to seek wisdom this year.

There's a thin line between one thought from the other. It is for you to find the balance. It is how we are able to weave through the Bible, for instance, without drowning in sexist verses.

There's the letter. And there's the truth.

The letter is... 

You may not want to be in a relationship because of what you can get from the other person, especially financially... because we are such hungry/poor people, we jump out of our skin the minute we think our partners are going to make financial demands a part of the exchange in relationship. It's a third world mess. It is disgraceful thinking.

We'd rather ask a friend for money.

I find that ridiculous.

The truth is...

If you are in a relationship, and you two cannot exchange the best of you...then that's just some high school romp you need to get out of.

A lady wanted financial help. I know her man; so I was curious.

"Why don't you ask him?" I asked.

"I don't want him to think I am with him because of money."

But you are having sex. You are eating together. Laughing together. Exchanging ideas. Dreaming together. Sharing happy moments and sad realities. Together. 

If we haven't reduced relationship to something only better than used tissue paper, why shouldn't we lean on our so-called partners for help (male or female)?

The idea is to give the best of you to your partner. We are not to decide what the best of you is...but if you own establishments and your partner is looking for an average loan to start a business...and s/he cannot come to you...then there is a problem.

It's as crazy as having 10 cars parked in your garage and your partner takes an okada to work.

See ehn, let's stop playing around with simple truths...

If you cannot give the best of you to your partner...If you think it is outrageous to give financially in a relationship...

Then date people who are financially secure. Date your financial kind.

To have that glaring difference between you and your partner and not do anything about it is wicked.

Heck! People give to others they don't even know...how much more the person they are with.

How do you sleep with someone you know you can help but refuse to...

Because you want to be sure the relationship is not about money? 

Please get out of here!
