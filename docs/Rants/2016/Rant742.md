In a country ravaged by religion and fanaticism...

A young man (not 7, by the way) was stripped, beaten and set ablaze under the judgment of the sun, with spectators for sport.

If you trace this habit to a past, you will find religion at the rudder of this kind of misfortune.

It is not god that will save us.

We need to stay away from all gods and embrace development of any kind - through technology, science, through arts, literature... anything that will allow us employ our mind fully will free us from the claws of babarism funded, ironically, by religion- the institution that pleads for mercy and grace.

Conscience is a terrible thing. Conscience denouement is devastation and death. It is the irony of everything that pleads to save, but kills and destroys. Perpetuating more evil than the one that they claim was made of evil.

The idea of one church, for instance, seizing all activities in a city of over 30 million people every first Friday of the month... is the kind of activity that breeds people who think in a straight line to commit the kind of atrocities that support a lifestyle of lynching and burning of others. 

Or, at least, ignores the lynching and burning of human flesh. 

Are we, as humans, not supposed to be uncomfortable to watch even a goat set on fire?

There were Christians standing there watching that man burn. There were Muslims too. Traditionalists etc. All present to rationalise the mob justice of that man, with a scripture verse running through their heads to indeed establish reasons from spiritual books why it is right to burn a thief.

It will not matter what we say about this case or the next or the one after...

We need to get rid of religion completely. Let all trace of it be in individual homes, under the burden of silence and personal conviction. Let religion be out of our streets and businesses and schools and agencies. 

Religion must be absent from our institutions. Let it be a silent request without loudspeakers or blatant lies on billboards and commercials. 

Let religion pay tax. Let religion fall in line and be judged by the law of the land. 

If we do not end religion we will continue to wail over neanderthal reactions to social issues.
