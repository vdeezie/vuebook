If you want to help someone, help. 

Their (in)gratitude should not be your business. 

Whether it comes as profusely as it should or as a whisper...don't focus on the direct consequences of your kindness.

Of course, gratitude would determine if they'd get a second chance at anything else with you... and really, the shock of their thanklessness may never leave...

But at first, help.

And don't let their lack of appreciation affect the next person in line.

The universe is not structured in a way that allows beneficiaries to become our rewards. 

Some of the most ungrateful elements you'd encounter are people you would have helped. 

They would ask for a chance. You'll give them a chance. Then they'll spend the hours trying to infect your space with nonsense.

Yet it shouldn't deter you from giving or helping. 

Give even more. With discretion.

Everything that pushes you to the next level is a reward that is linked in some ways to the good you did for others.

The beauty of life is... our own help doesn't come from those we expect.

If your reward is the thanks you get from lending a hand...

Then it is too small a reward.

Help and then look the other way. Build opportunities for others then walk away.

Don't stand at the door of what you built for someone, expecting immediate feedback. 

Let the universe respond to your kindness.

Allow the universe respond at its own time.

(Maybe,some day, when you are stuck in New York *hehehehe)

Omo, bhet...we don epp people oh! Chai!

We keep bringing people together who turn around to form tag team against us...

We keep giving opportunities to people who give nothing back- not even a needle...

We place other's needs ahead of ours, even when they turn Oliver Twist on us...

We fight for others, when all they do is murmur and spread shit on the bread they offer back.

We do it because it's really not about them.

Think about your own life and the favours you need.

Think about your kids and the One who watches over them.

Think. Sow. And walk away.

Life tells a better story when it is left to direct the script by itself.

But it doesn't mean you have to take shit. 

Clap back at idiots, if you must. 

But make it epic. Make it count.
