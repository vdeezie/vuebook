# Rant594


January 28, 2016

My assistant books an impromptu meeting with a moneyed career figure…

Right on the spot, in the middle of another meeting.

She tells me, "get up and go!"

I powder my nose, wear my pink heels, drag my bag along.

Three of us head to the venue.

It’s a stone-throw away but we are in heels and the sun is hot.

So we take the car instead. It’s a longer trip because of the one-way signals on the road.

We are 10 minutes late.

We hurry in…too many conference suites…oh dear!

Where? Where? Where?

Here! A cleaner says.

There! The laundry man shouts.

No over there! The security guard announces.

We take the step. Take the elevator.

Time is running out. Our contact is getting impatient.

We finally find the conference suite.

*whew*

“You have two minutes,” his assistant says.

I open my mouth and the rant falls out. 

I sell my business. My brand.

He is kind. He is smiling. He shakes our hands. He nods. He accepts our documents.

I drop necessary career details.

He hands me necessary information.

We rise. We shake hands again. We find our way to the door.

THAT is social climbing.

Or an attempt at climbing a ladder.

It is a valid ambition.

Weddings or pursuing business clients...our sanity, our happiness hinges on something.

I love the heat of work. I love deadlines. I love presentations. I love being challenged at work. I love career debates. I love 'em all.

But others may find their joy in other less nerve-racking activities, and will do everything to get in. To be accepted. To be part of a happy crowd.

These things are valid.

Our (legitimate) needs are valid.
