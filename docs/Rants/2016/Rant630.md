Children's movies don't prepare children for life.

Cinderella will not be saved by a prince. She needs to leave her wicked stepmother, go into town and work for a fee.

Sleeping beauty better wake up. No kiss of life is coming your way. If you need it badly, kiss yourself in the mirror.

Why do we present these lies to children?

It's a tough world. Shouldn't children be aware of that? 

It wouldn't result to rationing their meals or giving them less of their favourite snack...but to acknowledge reality is a big step to grooming children with principles.

And there's the small part of consequences we always try to shield our children from.

If a toddler puts his hand into a plate of hot soup, slap his wrist. He is going to cry. It's ok.

Let him cry. Tears are not terminal. 

He would learn a lesson: You do not put your hand into a hot plate of soup.

The next time you have a plate in front of you, he is going to give you that cute look for permission to turn your soup to watercolour.

Consequences. 

I took my kids to Amusement Park the other day. 

We watched two movies- Kungfu Panda and Zootopia at the cinema.

We had a thrilling ride on 5D. Then headed to Amusement Park.

I spent close to N10,000 on rides only! It was crazy. So for a few hours of fun, I spent over N25,000 with lunch and snack.

But Ife didn't like the last ride. Only the last ride. And she thought it necessary to sum up the entire day based on that last ride.

"I didn't enjoy today," she said as we headed home.

"Don't say that. We had great fun!" Jolade cautioned.

"Well I didn't!" She sulked.

I swear, I wanted to reach out that minute and punch her in the face! But we don't do that to children. There are other ways of disciplining a child. 

I turned to look at her. 

"Excuse me, what did you just say?"

She had the effrontery to repeat it.

"I didn't enjoy today! That last ride was a mess. I almost threw up!"

"Is it the last ride OR the entire day that was a mess?" I asked.

"Whatever. That ride spoilt it for me," she sulked. 

She didn't know what was coming. She was still playing diva, acting like one of those spoilt kids in those annoying Disney Channel series.

"Now look at me young woman. I just spent a security guard's salary trying to entertain you..."

"What has a security guard got to do with-"

"Shut up!" I was vexed, "I am still talking."

It was gradually coming to her- common sense.

"I will not spend that kind of money and have you disregard all the fun activities we had today. I didn't make the decisions, you and your sister did. I paid for everything you wanted. Everything you touched, I bought..."

Now I was breathing fast.

"Are you going to sit there and ruin our day-out with those ungrateful words OR are you going to put your thoughts in order and say what you really mean to say correctly?"

Her eyes dropped. Diva wings stopped flapping. 

"How about this: I'll take Jolade out next week, and leave you with grandma so you can help her sweep her house and wash her kitchen napkins. Deal?"

Jolade, sitting in the middle, was as stiff as a log. I feared she might pee in her dress. Lol!

"I am so sorry mum. What I meant to say was I hated the last ride, but the rest of what we did today, I enjoyed them all."

I nodded. 

I asked them if there was anything else they'd want before we got home.

"Some chocolates, please."

"Ok."

End of story.
