Dear Nigerian Philanthropists, I beg you...

When you feel like empowering the girl child with a few naira notes...

Do not compare her situation to whoring.

It is banal to believe that a girl is one step away from prostitution if she doesn't embrace...

1. Tailoring 

2. Hairdressing 

3. Basket weaving or Adire tie-and-dye

4. Marriage 

5. Apprenticeship at a mechanic shop or any mannish wonder-job women are incapable of interpreting. 

Do not place your money as a surety to "honour" her vagina. Gosh!  

Do not speak to her about craft or business as an elixir to whoring. 

To be schooled by a man hiding an erect penis under a table, looking down your cleavage, questioning your sexual activities...with a miserable N300,000 pledge dangling from his tongue, is worse than many physical ailments. 

To be admonished by a woman in burnt orange Manolo Blahnik about chastity and celibacy as keys to wealth (oh lawd!)...flaunting her exquisite ivory life of perfection as the epitome of "womanhood" is worse than dying in the hands of poverty. 

You are either going to give OR you are going to let people live with dignity they can scrape off their daily disenchantment.
