Will any Nigerian entertainer turn down a 45 minutes show that'll earn her/him $5million?

I don't think so.

Justin Bieber did.

No, he is not mad. 

He was invited to performance at the Republican convention for $5m. He considered it...but his manager, Scooter, said no!

Scooter is a big supporter of Hillary. This is a case of integrity. You can't speak from both sides of your mouth. That's Scooter's point.

It is easy to place integrity over money in a society that has working institutions. 

Our entertainers will grab an opportunity for $5m (heck! For even N500k) to welcome Bode George from prison...or sing Abacha to a second term... because structures don't exist here.

And there's nothing dignified about hunger.

Scooter has made alot of money for Justin Bieber using the institutions in America that support entertainment growth. 

Here in Nigeria, we can't even get through religious fanatics to build a lousy film village!

So the Nigerian entertainer will grab that $5m and sack the disgruntled manager because s/he may NEVER get that kind of opportunity again.

Justin turned down a moment of making personal history of big cash for just 45 minutes performance because his society tells him there's more to life than money...

The society doesn't just say it...it demonstrates this fact to him and every young person every other day.

In Nigeria, our athletes have set up a gofundme account to sponsor their trip to the Olympics!

To represent your country at the Olympics is now the responsibility of the athlete and "well meaning Nigeria" whose finances are being stretched to do everything the government refuses to do.

Nigerian entertainers will grab $5m to sing for the most corrupt politician because if s/he happens to fall sick... there are no health facilities to address and attend to her/his needs.

S/he would need, again, to set up a gofundme account to treat an illness. 

And the account might be judged a fraud. And closed. And controversy. And video shots. And blogs. And rants. And tears. And final death.

You can't even be ill in Nigeria and face your death in peace. Money issues will come to mock you as you head to your grave.

So, you can't understand Justin Bieber. These things look foolish to us.

There you are grudgingly heading to an office everyday that hasn't paid you in 5 months... then you open the papers and read this shit about Bieber turning down $5m...and you want to beat someone to death! Lol!

Structures, my people. Institutions and structures that look out for the good of its citizens make all the difference. 

Your church sermons and motivational classes will not build confidence and integrity in the lives of people... those are the icing. And they can be ignored.

If you need Nigerians, especially the youth to have integrity and stand for something, build your institutions on solid rock...

And watch them say NO to millions wrapped in a campaign they don't believe in.
