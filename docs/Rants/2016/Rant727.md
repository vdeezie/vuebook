# Rant727

I haff come again.

So... I dropped my girls this morning in school at approximately 7:20am.

My daily routine after drop-off is to: park the car at the school... spend 30 minutes inside my car sending my articles for the day to my assistant at www.happenings.com.ng... then take a one-hour jog/walk... and back to my car.

So I am inside the car, writing the text for #NaijaChronicles this morning, when a man walks by...

I see him coming. 40-ish, very Nigerian, a man-purse under his arm like a tax collector's, with a religious or patriarchal bounce...

He looks at me, I look at him. We acknowledge our existence. 

He walks by. I keep looking through my rear view mirror... because I know this script so well.

After four steps past my car, he turns quickly back to where I park and opens his mouth...

"Madam, morning..."

"Keep it moving," I said.

"Sorry?"

"I said keep it moving. I am not interested in anything you have to say or preach... even if you are selling a genuine tablet that will make me live a hundred years... just keep it moving."

"You are funny," he laughed.

"Keep. It. Moving"

I hate how vulnerable society thinks women are.

He must have noticed me in some ways: this woman always dropping off her kids in school... where is her husband? She must be lonely... in need of comfort or the word of the Lawd. Maybe I can warm up to her...see if there is space in her life for a moin-moin like me.

OR it could be:

This woman... looks like she has some kind of "pay"... after all she can afford this school... I can play a quick one on her... sell her a nice product that is supposed to be coming from "the abroad"... women always fall for that kind of thing.

Just like the CD seller who came to my car on Friday to market "Christian music for your children". I hissed and increased the volume of my very angry DMX track.

Who are you to tell me what my children should listen to?

"But madam you don't even know what I have to say..." The morning man continues.

"Very true. But I know you are about to prey on a stereotypical vulnerability or fear or pain or need you believe all women have. I don't have it. I don't have any pain or fear. I am not impuissant. And I have no need that I cannot meet for myself... So with this new knowledge of me, do you still have anything to say?"

(Yes, I said "impuissant" just because.)

He scratches his head and walks away.

Abeg make I go jog.

Enjoy a new day, y'all.
