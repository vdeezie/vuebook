Nigerians will rank highly on the "Insecure and totally confused people in the world" list... if that survey ever happens.

Here's why:

Ad: Teach your child french this holiday. Enrol at Farabale school of linguistics.

Nigerians: So who is going to teach our children Ishan, Ijebu and Isoko. Why french?

*
Ad: Ciara performs her hit song at Dolphin estate.

Nigerians: Why Dolphin estate? Why not Lekki where there are nice houses to portray Nigeria well?

*
Ad: Darey releases his R&B album titled, "Love in Paris"

Nigerians: Why R&B? Why not juju or fuji? Why copy Usher? Why not walk in the footsteps of KWAM1? And how come he is talking about Paris? Why not Isale Eko? 

*
Ad: Teach your child a skill, enrol for piano lessons.

Nigerians: Why piano lessons? Why not talking drum? Or shekere? Or the bald of your village headmaster?

*
Ad: Chef bubuski will teach you how to make Italian bruschetta and mozzarelline fritte.

Nigerians: How about jollof rice and dodo? How about that? Why mozzarrellas? 

*
Ad: Teach your child chess.

Nigerian: Why chess? Why not a game like how to catch a rat and skin it alive like real Africans do before civilisation?

*
Why this? Why that?

Ask yourself: why are you so stupid? What is wrong with your hands and legs and brains to do what you ask of people. 

1) If you want to teach Isoko, teach Isoko! Then teach all 400 Nigerian languages. Ban English if you must, so we can all communicate in 400+ ways.

2) Paint the entire Dolphin community next time Ciara comes to town to dance. To hide your national shame.

3) There are many juju musicians and fuji faithfuls.  Let Darey play whatever the hell he wants to play. 

4) Start a school for Nigerians to learn how to play the local flute, pay for classes and run with the vision. Don't criticise parents who prefer piano lessons. You sound like an idiot. 

5) Cook jollof rice. Cook eba. Roast plantain. Heck, eat a live cow. Don't tell a chef what she must make because she happens to be Nigerian.

Your Nigerian insecurity will not find its healing in the daily bits of happiness in other people's choices. 

Go and live your Nigerian life. 

And remember not to wear a tie or even a shirt, wear ankara only! Throw your smart phone away... why not empty cans connected with a rope for communication?

Why a laptop? Why not pen and paper? Oh shoot! That still isn't Nigerian enough.

Why not a stone and a wall to scribble your thoughts?

Why a hotel suite? Why not the top of a tree? 

Why a white gown for your wedding? Why not leaves and naked breasts?

We can go on and on.

But I'm sure you get the drift. 

Yes. Shut up.
