I think my biggest success as a parent is watching my daughters become friends.

"You're all you've got," I tell them. 

It's scary and exciting at the same time for them. I see it in their eyes.

I will not always be here. 

Working a career takes alot of your time.

And if a white lover comes along who is intrigued by my mediocre success, and likes my chocolate skin enough to lick it everyday...

And where he finds the biscuit, eats it...

Then time will be divided between the girls and him.

You see?

Because I will not be that parent who waits for her children to reward her at old age by filling the spaces meant for eros love with constant demand of bric-a-brac that torments the buyer and makes the receiver resentful. 

Because nothing can compensate for a life you should have lived but you didn't.

I will not leave any space to blame society or patriarchy either.

I might have this really boring schedule. I might find the most regular things exciting...

But it is what I want. Whoever said rebellion has to be adventurous, reckless or promiscuous?

Rebellion is you living on your terms. And if you are as boring as I am, then rebellion is booking into a hotel room to read the remaining chapters of Wuthering Heights (though you read it many years ago), so you can move to the next book...or an interesting article.

So let them be friends, and watch each other's backs...

For the days my back will be lying in bed somewhere in Seychelles, receiving pleasure.

*PS: You pipu think ayam joking about dis "white lover" thingy abi? My gawd is a miracle worker.
