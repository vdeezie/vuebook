I was at my Chairman's office today for our weekly Happenings meeting. 

A call comes in. It's a lady. She has a request to make. Chairman listens.

He shakes his head. 

"Why are you asking me for money again? You asked only two months ago, I helped you out. And you are back again. Am I an ATM machine? This is unfair."

I cringe.

There is the "poor" who needs help. And then there's the "rich" who does not want to feel like his only purpose on earth is to fix your problem. 

The "rich" gets my empathy. 

The "African rich" gets my condolences.

Everybody believes they are entitled to your money... even the random individual you meet at a Christmas party organised by a bank where you left a million naira to grow branches.

We can do so much better with the social relationships we have.
