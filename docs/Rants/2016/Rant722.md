What really upsets me most about Christianity is its cowardice. This spineless manipulative religion!

A 14 year old girl has been forced into marriage (forced, because she is a minor and cannot make decisions of her own. She is a child!)… where is Christianity when you need it!

What did Christianity do when it heard the news? It made a "friendly" call to the paedophile and his community and before the wink of an eye, Christianity had its tail between its legs, surrendered to arguments on consent… and has left everything to God.

A languid and lifeless faith.

It’s shameful.

How can you live in a time like this without a fight in you?

Christianity is so selfish, it’s sickening.

The only time its voice appears valiant is when it needs to extort money from you- tithe and offering and building projects and pastor’s appreciation shenanigan.

The moment it is expected to rise up to any occasion and take a stand, exercise selflessness and humanity and a goddamn fight, it shrivels like a weakling.

What has Christianity done for you except cause major traffic on your street, interrupt your sleep, and feed you with spiritual witchery of sudden wealth and miraculous health?

It is science that continues to save you from dying of malaria or typhoid or cancer. It is science that gave you that child. It is science. Almost all the miracles you claim to have experienced were actually science at work. But you have been told not to give “glory to man”, so you lift up your hands to the sky and you thank a God you have no relationship with… because your Christianity is not about Christ. It’s about your greed, what you want now, the job you are unqualified to get but you covet, the promotion you haven’t worked for but you claim… and excellent scores you want but did not prepare for.

That’s the 21st century Nigerian Christianity. It endorses indolence, witchcraft, greed, cerebral malady.

There’s no fraud quite as incredible as Christianity.

A religion always seeking the easy way out. The easy way to get rich, the stress-free way to be a prodigy. Whilst the entire world labours, Christianity is lounging on a beach waiting to be rewarded by the “sweat of the enemy”.

Sick. Cheap. Stupid.

Your ministry feeds the poor jollof rice and sprite. You visit prisons once a year. And you sponsor the education of 10 children.

Is that it? 

In a world where one individual who has never prayed to a god gets to feed communities, sponsor education of many, and save little children banished by exorcists...

What new perspective on hope does Christianity bring to this era?

We do not need religion to feed the poor or send poor children to school. That's basic kindness and commonsense every human being is born with 

So what then is your Christian purpose at this time of our lives?

How can you be part of a society where little girls as young as our daughters are coerced into new religion and married off for sex… yet you flaunt pastors with Lamborghinis and expensive purses.

We are more obsessed with locating missing ribs that we have forgotten how to walk away to a corner and think.

We spend too much money trying to preach about finding the right partner we forget that there are millions of right partners who have found themselves... yet cannot afford to take care of the children their from their finding had produced. 

Sincerely every church should close down. You don’t need religion for things you can get. Or things you don't need.

Hope is like alcohol. It doesn't solve the problem. It just makes it go away for awhile. But when it comes back, it brings legions of psychosis along... in the front seat is deep dark depression.

Forget hope. It's the new zombie.

We need Christianity for moments like these.

Dear Nigerian Christian Associations, where are your balls? Where is your fight?
