I don't understand myself anymore.

Maybe I have a mental disease sef.

Ogunbanwo spread a mat in public, opened her legs...and through her vagina, shared many stories.

And I am here watching Trevor Noah. 

Unfazed. 

Why am I not fazed?

Why do these things not get to me?

Why?

One dude from my past resurrected from the grave and thought it cool to threaten me with munched conversations. He was quite excited about the entire Ogunbanwo thing.

Actually I can't blame him... I kicked him out of my house and told him to carry his Christmas gift along some years back. 

So his joy at this moment where he believes I must be in serious pain is justified, abi?

Ok.

But I asked him a few questions:

Did we have sex? No.

Did I kiss you? No.

Do you have my nudes? No.

Am I celebrity enough for people beyond a certain jobless circle to care? No.

Go ahead and share all our conversation. I said.

Of course he didn't like that kind of reply. He wanted me to be worried about something as ridiculous as conversation. 

These people... do they live in the bush?

It's even sad that I would have to ask a man if we had sex to assure him that he has no advantage over me. It's sad.

So he said:

"I have over three accounts following you. If you block me, I still have you. You have no idea..."

I told him he could have one million fake accounts following me, I don't care. SHARE OUR CONVERSATION. 

When that didn't produce any impact, he added...

"This is not strength you are exhibiting, this is something else."

But I have always said I am a demon. You people don't listen.

He then tried another tactic...

"I accept I sent you cheap gifts, but why did you treat me so shabbily?"

You see the number of questions and obsessions I have to deal with from these men?

How does a threat turn to questions on how you was treated a few years back?

When I was a celebrity publicist, I had told a client to allow bloggers release her sex tape.

They had the tape. They were threatening and blackmailing her for years.

So when she hired me, and the threats escalated...I told her to let them upload the tapes if they wanted to.

She thought I was mad.

But my people, it was the only way to gain back her freedom, her sanity.

The threats was never going to stop. She was paying to keep them quiet, and being unnecessarily chirpy with people she had no business being chirpy with just to gain their favour. And she also used her mother's influence at some point to intimidate them.

But for how long do you keep fish away from water?

So back to my own sturvs.

To be unfazed by these things is not normal. I swear, I tried to be fazed and concerned...but it wasn't coming. So I decided to eat from the free cyber popcorn. 

Some sort of out of body experience.  

Because really, this power that I have to make people mad is something I need to harness. 

Or is it the English that is too retarded for me?

Maybe because the grammar and theme is the typical boring women-and-the-business-of-their-vagina shit...and all the required exaggerations of a Tele Mundo series.

These things are stale. We need to improve on our insults.

I love sentences. I love brilliant sentences. These people are incapable of anything that can make me worry.

These kind of fights, I see them everyday.

A neighbour had a visitor once who stood on her balcony for 4 hours calling her Ashawo...

Bus drivers call the female passengers without change Ashawo.

Toasters who couldn't cross over to the next episode of love call the women they are dying to have Ashawo.

Women with a bit of success and no trace of any man within 10 miles are always regarded as Ashawo.

So what else is new?

The only person that can faze me a bit would be Ms. Ahanmisi... because she would be original in her madness and would leave vagina alone and carve sentences that gods can worship. 

So if you have more time on your hands and my misery is your ambition and your top priority... get Ahanmisi to help you draft a post then maybe I can do LIVE Facebook video to share my tears.

Because to be bored and unfazed even during a so-called cyber war is not good at all.

I want to worry.

Make me worry.
