I just watched a series called 'Suddenly Rich' on TLC. True life stories of people who hit big fortune.

A couple bought a house from a relative. A few years later, an oil company shows up at their door with papers and rights to drill on their property. 

It was at first very distressing for the couple, not until they realised...

They'd get the cash equivalent of a barrel of oil (or so) for every drill.

So every month, there's a cheque waiting for them in the mailbox. 

The first cheque was $1,500... the second cheque, $3,000...

Now they get cheques from $75,000 to $250,000 MONTHLY!!!

*Phew!

Talk about money rain!

They've been receiving these monthly cheques for years.
*
The next couple went digging in a "treasure land" where the most precious item ever been found was, probably, a $500 stone. 

But they dug a stone worth $250,000!

*
The next suddenly rich individual was an eighteen year old boy who did penny stocks on his smart phone. A high risk trade fraught with fraud and loses.

One day after school, he checked his phone and he was $93,000 rich instantly. So he set up two tech companies and earns $30,000 monthly.

*
Next is a stage assistant for rock bands. He was the go-to employee to buy pizza or soda.

He visited a vintage store one day, found an interesting item. It was the Declaration of Independence, an engraved luxury.

He bought it for $2.40...

Took it to an auctioneer, after confirming its authenticity, it was auctioned for... wait for it... $477,000.00!!!

*
Phew!

And none of these people promised to pay tithe oh... or even thanked God on TV.

And God still blesses them.

Odiegwu!

We Nigerians will not take eeeeeeet!!!

Toh!

And please note that nobody tried to dupe them in the line of trust that they required to received their fortunes. 

1) The oil company didn't try to rob them of their monthly largesse, like Shell robs Niger Delta.

2) The members of staff at the treasure land didn't try to keep their precious stone. They told them truthfully the worth of the diamond- an 8.5  carat stone.

3) The relatives of the 18 year old boy did not rush to babalawo to "destroy the blessing of my cousin's child".

4) The auctioneer did not lie about the worth of the declaration sheet.

Everyone, without God intervention, did the right thing.

And when they asked them, how do you feel?

I feel lucky, they said.

Not the Nigerian way where we declare that "God has shamed my enemies, now I can buy a rolls Royce" and all other stupid subs. 

I am certain that our collective idiosyncracies irritate God.

How we use His name to spite others. How we call out to Him as a tool for hate or scorn. 

Just collect your fortune, acknowledge your luck and go into the future with plenty of money.

No. It is not enough of a blessing if we can't get others uncomfortable by it.

Ugh!
