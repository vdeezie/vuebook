People expect too much from pastors. You want to gaze into cerebral depths? Then read extensively. Seek for exhaustive details in the search for knowledge. Have an encyclopedic appetite for life. Be thorough in your accomplishment of being well-rounded.

Don't look at pastors. They can't give you that. They (are supposed to) follow a book. The Bible is where all their answers are.

If indeed the Bible insists that mental illness is caused by sin... that is exactly what a true pastor must preach. They are sold to the word of God.

If it upsets you, then really you may want to argue with God... if you find Him.

A pastor is only a vessel of something he has chosen to be a carrier of. And he must stand the risk of sounding like an idiot.

It is supposed to be a small price to pay for the gospel. 

As the bible says, na the foolishness of the world gangan be the main thing. Intellectuals will burn. Or something like that.

Why we want pastors to be "woke" is what I don't understand. 

Do you really think a "good pastor" is going to choose your ideas over the Bible?

I watched The Accountant yesterday at the movies. Ben Affleck is an autistic man (with destructive temper when he was a child) who had to protect himself from a world always trying to bully his kind. He was different from the mass of regular people. It is an over-determined movie, but I get the idea. 

Autism is not something less than anything, it is different. Period.

That is what years of study and information and books and allowing your mind to be consumed by knowledge should do to you. 

Not church. Stop seeking your answers from the lips of a pastor. Stop being so shocked when they sound like something from under a rock.

You want your pastor to be "woke"?

Or maybe just a simple need to fit into regular "woke" thoughts. Forget that many people lashing out at Sam Adeyemi are, at the moment, aware of mentally ill relatives that are stashed in a village away from sight, comfort, public scrutiny, civilization... because deep down they too find the problem to be spiritually made. They see them as burdens. In extreme declarations, an embarrassment.

So what's the difference between Sam, the Bible and your deep secret thoughts of the mentally ill?

We are looking up to pastors to edit the Bible. It is not their job. They will continue to spew these things from a point of superior spirituality...

You, as a human being or a medical practitioner  will continue to disagree.

It is how it will always be.

I really don't care for disturbing Bible verses... because you will find many disturbing verses in the bible. How you then choose to attack one or two verses on mental illness is shocking. Haven't you read what the letter thinks of women menstruating? 

When it is time to address it in churches, you will all go into a frenzy again. Biko find a sustainable movement to pour all your anger into.

The only part I find pretentious is Pastor Sam expecting medicine to cure mental illness. 

No. If indeed he believes, as a pastor, that mental illness is caused by sin, then only the word of God can cure it.

Doctors don't cure sin.

So it's a lazy move to sneak that in. Half-woke attempts at appealing to the world.

Doctors cure sicknesses. Jesus forgives sins.

So if mental illness is something you get for being a fucking sinner... then read that Bible, pray everyday of your life, chew and meditate until the illness is gone. 

If you believe it is a sickness, then visit the hospital. 

But to speak of Sin and Science from same breath reduces this to a people-pleasing sermon, a balancing act of sort. A bit of "worldly wisdom" and "heavenly letter".

God will miss lunch because of this.

PS: It is amazing how feminists and anti-feminists come together to fight religion. I see them on social media. Momentary buddies on something both gangs can Hate with desperate hatred.

Lol! Jokers.
