I remember when I was married and broke, I would lament to Seun.

(Married and broke yet somebody will not let me hear word: "submit, submit, submit. We are not equal!" Mafren' shut up there!)

In her practical manner, she sought immediate solution. She had launched a new business as an events planner and already had a big party to organise...it was the birthday of Fashola's aide's grandmother. I think.

Or was it Fashola's grandmother?  

It was a big party, and Fashola was present.

The finest flower of society. The cream of the cream. It was a jaw dropping crowd.

And I was assigned to manage the event. 

I did a bad job, of course. 

I didn't smile long enough. I didn't check on tables quickly enough. I wasn't grouchy, I just wasn't sure how to go about these things even after briefing.

Seun paid me but never hired me again. 

It was tough love. But it was necessary love. 

I believe in tough love. And I respected her decision. 

I appreciate how she is able to keep a friendship and still demand mastery at work and a bit of savoir faire in business...

And will sack you easily if you do not meet up. 

Friendship will not put food on her table. Friendship will not pay her bills. If friendship cannot meet up, then friendship would have to shapen up...or move to the side. Just a few steps away from where the rays are coming in. 

It is tough love. It is important love. 

That friendship shaped me.

She paid school fees at one time. She presented opportunities for freelance work a few times. Trying to help a broke friend everytime I called.

What more was there to be done?

Her friendship isn't soppy, it's tough, it's real, and it is incredibly kind.

Tough kindness. Tough love.

I would follow her to interesting events- launch of new collections by renowned designers.

She, of course, had enough money to buy an entire rack of clothes.

In that friendship I learned to watch people who make money, spend money without expecting any handouts. 

Seun wanted me to be poor with dignity. 

Oh! Bless!

She wanted me to follow her to these fancy and expensive gatherings and be ok with it. Without desiring anything I could not afford. Without relying on her generosity that was not mine to demand.

Friendship with Seun taught me more than any book I ever read.

One time I bought an expensive dress from one of those fashion events...

I borrowed the money from Seun to pay.

It was nothing to her, but there was a lesson I had to learn.

No handouts. Live the best life in your worst situation. Live in your skin. And let that be enough. 

So she would ask for the money. After all it was hers...and my lack wouldn't make it right to hold on to it (I didn't have to buy a dress!). It took a little while but I gave it back.

Tough love is the best kind of love.

It is the most sincere road to self-sufficiency.

Today, I hired a friend. This is the job available. You either want it or we keep searching. Either way, I am fine. But the year isn't going to wait for you. 

Tough love.

She jumped at it immediately. 

The best part was knowing she'd be earning a good salary. Something that was denied her for over 9 months at her former place of work.

I do feel awkward about it. But this is a job. 

And friendship doesn't necessarily pay bills.

We shall look out for our own. But we shall pass on the message of industry.

No free lunch anywhere. 

Tough love.
