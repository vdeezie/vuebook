We are all social climbers.

The chorister sandwiched between the pastor and his wife is trying to get the attention of a brother in the congregation she hopes will hoist her through the social ranks of crownless sisters to become “Mrs”.

We are all social climbers

We see the CEO of an impressive company. 

We get close to his assistant. 

What does he like? We ask.

Shit. We can’t afford to buy him a Rolex. Can we buy his daughter a premium swatch?

We send the gift. He smiles. He sends his own gift- his complimentary card. Worth more than gold.

We call. We want to take him out for lunch at Intercontinental Hotel where we can make a quick presentation.

We spend N25,000 for lunch for a N5million investment in a business. Not a bad deal.

Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t.

It’s a high risk game spending over N100,000 to get N2million. But we play it. Because we need investors and partners who can take our businesses seriously, lift it through the social rung. We need well wishers.

For those who can’t take those high risks of loss…

They attend weddings. Or funerals. 

I know people who have clicked deals at weddings (where) they had zero affiliation with the couples.

They dress good. Walk in. Blend in. And start a few conversations.

People are bold. We are all different. 

The economy is crap. People survive in different ways.

Weddings are an extension of our African hospitality. You can’t decide to have it any other way. It is your Corporate Social Responsibility to accommodate the entire city when you decide to say “I do”.

They don’t come for the food. How many weddings actually feed the entire "guests"? Some come for just networking- to make friends, meet people, exchange cards. Laugh, flirt and have a good time.

Deal with it.

Others do their social climbing at clubs and bars. They meet important associates; and begin the process of grooming acquaintances to become friends over bottles of Champagne whilst nodding their heads to loud music and admiring roaming buttocks.

Relationships are nurtured in churches. Not a word the pastor says sticks, but the cheque that is promised by a church member keeps the soul alive.

We are all social climbers.

I do not attend weddings or LIVE events. I do not understand the culture of sweat and live music and too much laughter… but I know it heals the soul for many.

Who are we to decide what method is valid to gain higher social status and what is not?

We are all social climbers.

Hustling our talent and industry on social media, hoping a company can endorse our skill, pay for our brand which we summarize in some of our tweets or posts.

We wish to climb social ladders.

As I find the dark corners of a movie theatre therapeutic, some others find weddings helpful for the stress they live out every day in one of the most disorderly and most expensive cities in the world.

Who are we to determine what makes another happy?

As long as it is not yet a crime to gate-crash a party, why should we ever get so petty that we call people out for what makes them human, happy and satisfied?

If we hustle to get complimentary cards of CEOs so we can gain their attention and introduce our businesses to them…Why should it be less legit to do the same for weddings?

Why is it beneath decency to hustle for a wedding invitation? 

Celebrities hustle for red carpet invites, no?

We take ourselves too seriously!

Brides-to-be are tweeting about people who are “begging” for wedding invites.

It’s just a bloody wedding. In four hours it will be over; then the journey begins. The world will not be there to live out your marriage for you…

What would the presence of two Yoruba demons - sorry - two brothers do to ruin your day?

At least they are willing to buy your aso ebi.

We are all social climbers.

Even friends getting set for D-Day are hoping to grab a piece of wonder in the form of a man (or two) from all the fanfare that may lead to the altar someday.

We are all intertwined..,

Unless you are a dud with no streak of ambition...

You are, at his minute, thinking of who-knows-who that can connect you to your next breakthrough.

And the rule is… you cannot decide how another reacts to your sub. You can’t. Your privileges end at the tip of your tongue- to speak or to shut up.

The moment you let the words out, anything can be used as a weapon to defend self.

Nobody goes to war with a handkerchief. It’s a bloodbath.

Keep climbing socially, biko.
