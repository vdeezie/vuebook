The delicious paradox of trying to appeal to Nigerian men with your own definition of Feminism is that...

Nigerian men will still not be sated.

"We are not equal. Period"

If you like serve pounded yam and oha soup and powder his nose to work... then come on social media to declare your feminism to be sweet, calm, and loving...

He's going to send a comment directly to you: "What do you need equality for?"

You know, like they treat their little nieces or children... "What do you need a new pair of shoes for? What do you need another watch for? Why do you need to visit Juliet?"

Why do you want to be equal to men? God didn't create the world equal.

So your feminism, this feminism that has to be loved by men, backfires right in your face.

So whether you think Feminism excludes men or includes men... or you are an angry feminist or a docile feminist or a sexy feminist or a lesbian feminist...

You are still on your own. 

This idea that we need to keep reminding men that we love them and want to include them in our "quest for equality" is pathetic and clearly demeaning...

Almost disgusting I can't even swallow water without choking.

You are still seeking permission from men to accept your feminism? You want patriarchy to endorse your fight for equality?

You want them to "shift small" in the danfo bus so you can share the seat. Do you know how uncomfortable that can be for people who just like to throway leg from one end of a bench to the other?

-Because the men who believe in equality do not need convincing. They READ. They know. They evolve.

Nigerian women are still in the business of changing a man.

Miracle workers of life. 

The Nigerian woman can turn a lazy fool to a hardworking executive... an irresponsible man to a phenomenal being. 

Like Jesus turned water to wine.

How's that working out?

Now you want to change a misogynist to a feminist by playing with his balls and telling him how inclusive your feminism is.

You have a chopping board for the different shades of feminism because you need men to know that yours is a better version that still allows you to be submissive.

I am tired. 

Nigerian women, I will write your book one day.
