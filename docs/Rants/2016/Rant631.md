This argument has lost its hold on me.

This argument on "you are the government, what role have you played in the issues concerning Nigeria?"

I am not the government. And I don't care what definition they gave you in primary school.

I am a writer. My duties do not include fixing bad roads, providing electricity, ensuring potable water gets to my children, or fighting mass poverty and disgraceful dollar surge.

No. That is not on me.

My duty is to vote for my candidates and obey the laws of the land and keep a good record as a citizen of this country. 

I am to excel in my field, contribute to nation-building by being the best writer I can be.

It is not my job to fix streetlights. 

I am not expected to carry a gun and attack street thieves who make life miserable for Lagos' car owners.

Am I expected to provide my own security? Apart from the lock on my gate (which in itself is a shame, homes should NOT have gates!)

We live like prisoners, yet we are not safe.

-Because governing a nation is not your immediate responsibility. 

You are a doctor- how can potholes be made your responsibility? Apart from the hole in a patient's brain, why should you be blamed for bad roads?

You are a bank manager- pray tell, are you the cause of zero electricity? Should it make any sense for people to fling that shit your way when you share your frustration?

Do we, ordinary Nigerians, have access to government resources and oil money to facilitate development?

So please it is time we shut up with this "what role can we play".

No matter your good intentions for Nigeria, you cannot achieve tangible results if government policies and activities are against common good.

Let government provide the amenities, then we can start to place responsibilities on average Nigerians living hand-to-mouth.

(And yes! It is largely government responsibility to stop a hand-to-mouth culture).

Only government can ensure Nigerians have access to good education, health services and conducive business clime.

Ever tried bringing European business ideas to Nigeria?

See how woefully a perfect business plan in the UK performs in Nigeria?

It is not on us. 

Stop being cowards. Demand better lives from the GOVERNMENT that sits on top of your tax funds, your resources, your oil (whatever value is left of it) and your life.
