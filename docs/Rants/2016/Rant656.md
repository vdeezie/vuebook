It is quite shocking that on all the long flights I've been in, I've never looked out the window to see the clouds.

And I do get lucky with window seats.

Today, I got lucky again. In fact, the entire row was free... so I made a bed, packed all three pillows under my head, threw all three blankets over me, and listened to Rihanna. 

A white dude across the aisle was just as lucky- he had four empty seats to himself! Amazeballs!! We smiled at eachother, celebrating our rare advantage on an Economy flight. 

This much comfort and room space...not even First Class can boast of it. Lol!

When it was 22 minutes to touchdown, I looked out the window and saw the cottons and mountains of clouds.

Shapes of many dreams. It was beautiful...

I cried. 

And I, well, worshipped God. 

I am not a cool kid or an intellectual so I still get to acknowledge God in almost everything. 

The Chinese man behind me peeped through the seats to ask if I was alright. 

"It is beautiful," I cried some more.

I don't think he understood, but he smiled and left me alone.

Albert Einstein may have brought us closer to our world...he made it possible for us to build an intimate relationship with the universe. He asked himself questions and took great advantage of his genius to change the look of physics...

But these answers have always been there.

Don't you think?

The theory of Relativity...the law of Photoelectric effect...

And the very popular equation (E=mc^2) which turned out to be not such a good thing in the hands of desperate citizens of the world.

Even the Newtonian theories...(some were debunked by Einstein at some point, abi?)

Quantum theory of light...gravity...

Physicists change the way we respond to the universe.. the geniuses amongst them transform our understanding of nature, of life.

But truth is... it has always been there. These theories. These answers.

The truth of our universe has always been with us even if we could not, before Einstein, make sense of it.

Gravity is real. Someone just cracked it and gave it a name for the rest of us to understand. 

Gravity will work with or without Einstein. 

His genius is credited to his impressive understanding of nature.

But it was- all of physics- even before him.

Because God is science. And science is God. 

Ok. Ok. I'm not a scientist but for what it's worth...

It is a beautiful world. 

It didn't make itself. It couldn't have. (Atheists allow me, biko. Just this night. The cloud was beautiful)

PS: I love my atheist friends, by the way.

PSS: I took a detour to get ogbono soup from my mother's fridge. 

No light. 

But I've got Nigerian food.

I can't even complain.
