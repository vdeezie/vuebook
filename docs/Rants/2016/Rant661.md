My near dating-of-a-married-man experience.

"I was shopping at Shoprite. I was not even properly dressed becoz I wasn't really trying to impress anybody. I was at the chicken section when a man said I should help him select chicken for his mother. I was really touched that a man would want to buy chicken for his mother.

"So we started talking and he followed me around the store and helped me with my own shopping...

"Although he didn't pay for my goods, he explained that he didn't really come out with cash and his ATM was in the car. I understood.
He was a nice guy and I didn't see any harm in collecting his number. 

"We had a date at a fastfood joint the next week. He said he likes me becoz I am down to earth. I wasn't forming. I finished my meatpie and drank my Schweppes. I wasn't asking for expensive lunch. I told him I was brought up well by my parents to be humble.

"So the next week, we went to the beach and he kissed me. I have not allowed him to sleep with me yet. It was when he was about to pay for the drinks...he brought out everything from his pocket and his wedding ring fell out.

"I was really disappointed. In fact I cried. And he said he doesn't really love his wife like that. I just told him to drop me at home. He begged that we should remain friends. I said there is no harm in that.

"Imagine. I would have dated a married man! Thank God oh!"

In Nigeria, this is some kind of achievement. Your near-sex-with-a-married-man experience.

If we weren't such humbug moralists, you'd fuck whoever you want to fuck and still go ahead to build the biggest technology firm in Africa.

-Because the thing about morals knotted with religion is the convenience of choosing it's own sin(s).

So you didn't fuck the married man, that is the achievement you will celebrate for two years... recounting the episode in every Nigerian Women Forum. Awaiting your applause. A pat on the back. Your medal.

Until the next achievement... when you finally leave your abusive boyfriend after cooking for him and swallowing cum for five years. Thank God. Again.

We are recording some of the most despicable "achievements".

In two years one white chick fucked someone but since it isn't something worthy of thanksgiving, she went ahead to join a team to build, say, the next space bus in China that can beat traffic...or something that amazing.

If you will live out your morals as you should, then we wouldn't have dead bodies of women in hotels with their pastors being accused of "jazzing" them to open their legs. Women who sing praise-and-worship with eyes closed and tears on their cheeks.

Do we even believe half the nonsense that we are?

Women, you need to stop worrying what language your vagina is speaking and push all that energy to your mind. 

Record new achievements. 

If you have to submit to anything, submit to a new way of thinking. Submit to technology, to science. Submit to your craft.

These are the elements of our future.

Like I said at Harvard...

I want to call my daughter and hear her say:

"Mum I just left Italy. You need to see the new discovery there. I'm heading to Australia. I might not be able to reach you immediately but I'll call in another week. I should be at Dallas by then. I'll be heading to South Africa next month though, but it won't be for long. I travel light these days. I'll send you pictures when I get to Paris. I met someone... I'll see how he fits into my life after I get a seat at the Valley. Mum, do you know there's a new tech device that can take you to Antarctica from your bed with a click of a button?"

I want that for my child.

I don't want a child who sits in a husband's house borning children and celebrating birthdays on social media. 

I don't. I don't. I don't.

God please! I don't.

You cannot be helped.
