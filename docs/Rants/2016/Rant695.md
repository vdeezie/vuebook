When a woman says... "I don't want kids"

It is not in your place to badger her with... "haba, how can you say that? Everybody loves children. I'm sure you'll like a mini-you to play with."

I know for Nigerians, this is hard. Minding your business. But I promise you, it will not kill you to respect other people's decisions. 

.

There are women who do not like to cook. 

I remember saying this somewhere and a man sniggered because he couldn't believed there'd be a woman who wouldn't love a pint-size dream of cooking for domestic purposes.

There are over 3 billion women in the world. How do you expect that we would all love the same things?

I have no kind of relationship with food or liquor. I don't think about food, I make no elaborate plans to eat. Ever.

I respond only to hunger, not need.

Yesterday my first meal was a sausage from Sweet Sensation by 5pm.

Why I need to explain this to anyone. Or have anyone try to persuade me to visit the open market more often...is something I detest.

How is it that you expect every woman in the entire world to love cooking?

I can whip up a nice pot of edikaikong soup... but that's survival, not love.

Our mothers would spend an entire day in the kitchen romancing pots of stew and soup. I spend less than an hour making a pot of afang soup. Why should my femininity be judged based on my love for cooking?
.

There are men who do not love ambition. They would choose to sit at home and take care of their kids if they have to. Free of societal pressures to be gods and alpha males. When you bant about success, it holds no impact. They just want to watch cartoons, iron children's school uniforms, interact and play with their kids.

There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't make them irresponsible. 

These men are home-makers. In developed societies, they are recognised. 

If homemaking isn't an irresponsible choice for a woman, then it shouldn't be for a man.

If you don't want that kind of man, fine. But understand that his needs are as valid as the needs of a woman to be a housewife.

The problem with Nigeria is usually religion that still endorses the husband as the head... instead of a partner. An equal.

If the househusband plays his domestic role and allows his wife breathe, all will be well in many homes. 

But no! The Nigerian society backed by misogyny and religion will insist that the husband who spends his entire day masturbating and watching television still needs to order another adult (a working wife) to submit.

A society that demands strict gender roles and forbids individuality or originality isn't growing.
