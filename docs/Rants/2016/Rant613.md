Let me make this clear:

I am one individual. I do not run an NGO. 

I move as my passion leads me. 

My passion is funded from my own pocket, that means I will do whatever I can and leave the rest for someone else to carry on.

I will not accept people forcing opinions on how to handle any case I decide to take up...

I will not accept bullying disguised as recommendations. 

This society belongs to all of us.

If you are not enraged by Child Rape then something is wrong.

Check your privileges. 

I refuse to turn this into some kind of intellectual discourse.

I will do what I want according to the law and pass the baton to someone else.

Anyone. Pick it up. And cleanse your bloody land.

Don't send me a list of suffering children. Don't be an ass.

We pay for everything, even fuel, when we need to charge rapists to court or make an arrest.

Even the roach in a house knows the police is poorly funded. 

So this is my point:

I will not accept cases tossed at me like I am supposed to pause my life to save the world.

I will choose my battles. Don't choose them for me.

Whatever it is you wish for anyone to do, do it yourself. 

This is not Bring Back Our Girls campaign.

I do not have the patience of Ezekwesili who has to listen to people on twitter tell her how to run an activity she chose to be part of.

Bloody armchair critics building thesis around the woman's methods and style of activism.

That's not going to happen here.

Check your privileges.

And if you want something done the way you think it should be done...

Do it yourself. 

Why-did-you-not-see-the-lawyer-before-the-doctor-before-an-arrest-before-counselling...

Joy-what-are-you-going-to-do-about-the-girl-who-gave-a-blow-job-to-a-grand-father...

No. No. No. Don't even dare!

We can all do that lazy armchair criticism, trust me-

Just sit on Facebook and be enraged. Post big words and allow the likes to accumulate, while your neighbour's six year old child is giving oral sex.

I will not accept your "urgent opinions".

I do it my way.

According to the law of the land.

Ps: for those who have reached out to contribute financially towards the process of justice...which is by far the most urgent opinion in these situations...

I thank you.
