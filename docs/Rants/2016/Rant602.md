This is how it ALWAYS happens, without exception:

I am on my own.

They start to get excited. They want to know me.

I am hesitant...

Because women.

We get close. They want more time. They want empathy. Roundtable sulking and dragging of feet to implement ONE project. 

I get bored.

I start to drift away carefully so we can at least stay virtual friends without getting into each other's space.

They call and say, "Why are you forming busy."

But I am not "forming busy". I am busy. And I have priorities, which you are not one of.

I am sorry, but friendships don't do me like that. I am not losing any hair for no woman.

Now they are offended. Joy is moving too fast on her own. 

It offends them.

How can they get her attention? How can they hurt this Joy?

They block me. 

But that usually takes me 8 months to notice. And I only notice because I am about to give them a business or a project worth quite a sum and networking worth its weight in gold. 

Then they unblock me to see how I am faring. Maybe I haff died of a broken heart. Lol!

Then I block them and throw the keys to hades.

I don't know why you people keep trying.

You gather. But you gather in vain. 

I am a god.

I know it is frustrating to see me winning. But just so you don't die of envy... maybe you should just stop trying to act so stupid.

I don't care about your lousy zero-impact friendship.

Befriending my ex-friends is equivalent to licking my vomit.

Next thing, you'd want to use my poop to eat egusi soup.

Why don't you stop losing so disgracefully?

Or just admit to yourself...

That Joy is a god.

Please bow down. Let me wash away your sins.

A friend paid my children's school fees some years back. Same friend contributed to my business recently. 

Another friend is taking my project to NewYork. She did everything. I paid for nothing. 

Another friend is investing N5m into my Web radio.

All of them zero drama.

If your brain has not been saut√©ed with Satan's sauce...

How then do you think you stand a chance as far as friendship as a measure of value goes?

You don't matter.

Drink tea.

You have lost. Again.
