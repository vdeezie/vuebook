I am always disturbed when I see teachers from "expensive" schools looking like they jumped out from a moving truck.

I met my daughter's English teacher...

And I was ashamed. 

She looked like she needed a bath. 

I wanted to pull out her ugly weave.

A general make-over, really.

I'm thinking to myself: I pay quite a sum here... why can't I see it reflect in the outlook of the teacher of one of the subjects I hold dear?

And that thick Igbo accent like soldiers marching to war.

Gboom. Gboom. Gboom.

The earth shatters to tiny pieces when she speaks. Vowels become lumps of fufu. Consonants are beaten to coma.

How can you teach English with that thick Igbo accent?

Now same daughter told me this evening that their PHE teacher cannot write good English. 

"We are always correcting him," she said.

If I go to the school tomorrow...they will say she has come again. 

This troublesome single parent has come again.
