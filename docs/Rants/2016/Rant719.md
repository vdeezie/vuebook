The world is filled with inarticulate rage and jealousy for any woman who dares to step out of the crowd. 

It is what Hillary suffers in this present circumstance created by her husband, Bill, on one hand; and her opponent, Trump, on the other. 

There is always a reason to blame a woman.

If she forgives and stays with a man of many sexual controversies, they question why she would stay if she was such a strong woman...

If she leaves him, they judge her strength and accuse her of leaving a broken man... and how she is going to grow old and unloved *roll eyes*.

Now, her husband's alleged sexual misconduct is affecting the most important rise of her career.

If it were the other way round... if Hillary had a bag of sexual secrets, the world and jobless Nigerians included, will start to campaign against "marrying bad wives"... "women who are out to destroy you..." "Jezebels and their cohorts sent to bring down a man"... "pray before you put a woman in your house..." and all types of madness from people who should worry about constant lack of electricity in their own damn country.

I had to unfriend someone who actually blamed Hillary for Bill's sexual mess. He accused her of being grumpy and old and uninteresting...and so forced him to look out too many times. 

In fact, I blocked him. Scrubbing the grease in my pot with bare hands would be a more tolerable practice than accommodating that person. He ceases to exist. To be so shallow makes you less of a human being everyday... until the last of you evaporates into thin air.

We shame Hillary for being strong, for daring to aim for presidency, for having flaws... we blame her for forgiving a randy husband... we blame her for the uncool suits she wears... we blame her for being loud... we blame her for her ambitions... we blame her for Bill's mistakes. 

Yes we do.

Your Abrahamic religions accuse her of going against the word of god, daring to be the authority of men.

We blame her for not being young... prettier... for not having "effeminate qualities" in the race to the mostt powerful position in the world... we blame her for everything. 

Men are angered by her audacities... women are jealous she isn't a housewife tending to a garden instead. 

We understand the flaws of men, but we cannot stand a woman who aims for higher position without a squeaky clean record of zero activity... throw in her desire to submit at the feet of a husband and she becomes the darling all women should aspire to.

Hillary is never going to be good enough because she is born as the wrong gender, and we just don't like this gender to aim too high.

Strive hard enough to get along with everyone and have girl-group cupcakes and wine hangouts... strive to be a parent and wait around for your kids as they play in the park... never miss a basketball training or sit close to the window as they play ten-ten. Support a husband to be the greatest in his field by sacrificing continously, blood by blood. 

But don't "over-do" for yourself. Don't strive for your own glory as a woman. You are backdrop material.

That's the inarticulate script women have to live by.

And if you are going to tear that script in shreds... you'll have to be ready for anything to be thrown at you.

The only thing left in this race is: should we have a qualified female or an unqualified male? It is a low jab for a woman of Hillary's pedigree. Women experience this all the time. Dealing with men and boys who shouldn't even come close to having any kind of opinion about you... open their mouths to speak and shit falls off every time. The lowest male is equal to the highest female, and is entitled to an opinion about her life. Because gender is the biggest issue in every situation.

It'd be foolish to have that cow, Trump, anywhere near the white house... 

I stand with Hillary. Her experience will come in handy in ruling the most powerful nation in the world.

May she find within herself the strength she needs and may it be enough. Because she may not find it anywhere else.

It's a tough world out here for her kind.
