ONE.

Feminsm is only feminism for some if they deal with people "beneath" them.

If they have to work with someone perceived to be more "successful", there's a need to defend their title.

Women have their competitive drab suit on always. And also their judgmental cap. 

How two women can work together and one of them has to continously distance herself from the other is just silly.

It's almost as if it is a crime to work with a "sister".

Literature meets Music.

Music samples literature. Yet literature needs to prove to the world that it holds a superior meaning to feminism. 

C'mon! Rest already! 

I hate to say this but there is something constantly tiring about madam literature. Even on the cover of a makeup ad... she is condescending to makeup. It's hard to understand what the purpose is to all of this... to be seen as uber cerebral without a cell missing? Phew! You've got to give yourself a break sometimes.

TWO.

A prostitute can be a feminist. We must understand that it is still the freedom to live as she wants in a society that permits licensed prostitution. 

It rankles the ordinary mind because they have an idea of what they want a feminist to be:

Not so pretty. Very angry. Bad fashion. Baggy jeans. Bad breath. Sideburns. Prickly moustache. Hate men. Forced to be with women because men aren't asking her out. Bushy brow. Reads Macbeth. Hates hip hop.

Anything away from the stereotype is dismissed harshly.

A housewife can be a feminist. Every wo(man) should be one... for the sake of having a voice powerful enough to:

1. Protect a child from rape by a father 
2. Stand up to be heard when her life is threatened in her marital home
3. Pursue more in life than just dusting the furniture 
4. Question some abnormal traditional practices that belittle widows and girl children. 

You do not necessarily have to attain boss status or work as a top female leader to do these things. 

If you stand against gender discrimination and you stand up to your neighbour when he hits his wife... or call the police when the madam of the house maltreats her housemaid, you are doing a better "feminist" work than all the online feminists yet to rescue a mouse from a gum trap. 

Feminism is in a small box in Nigeria... because the average Nigerian mind is a caged little animal.

THREE.

Even the women who proclaim to love feminism so much, it hasn't stopped them from checking if you are prettier, cooler, more likeable by men...and all other nonsense. As a matter of fact, I think feminism aggravates this madness.

In Nigeria, feminsm isn't making much of a difference. Anybody can be one, and then go ahead to live like a scoundrel, going against everything feminism stands for.

Like religion like feminism. It's all lip service. 

Nigeria is a very pretentious society, nothing good comes out of it.

Nothing good will come out of online feminism. Everyone is telling everyone the nonsense they will not take from men. That's all the feminism that exists here.

The need to gather many likes and hi-fives when you say "no man can..."

It is so pretentious because "a man is..." at the moment doing to you exactly what you swore on your Facebook wall will never happen.

Abeg! Rest!

Nigerians ruin everything.
