A 34 year old successful businessman was murdered.

It's a juicy case because he was killed close to the Secret Service training field.

This gets the attention of the FBI and SWAT team.

Money and Power.

The victim was a man with all the nuggets of success in his kitty. He loved to spend his money just as much as he loved making more.

The suspects were juicy too...

1. The President of his company whom he had many fall-outs with. There's a motive here: To get him outta the way so the rest of the board he usually disagrees with can go ahead and sell the shares of the company or go public with the business or do whatever they want without his constant disapproval.

2. A drop-dead gorgeous fiancee. They had many fights and police assumed it may have led to her decision to kill him. But motive is really slim. As a fiancee she is entitled to zero amount of his $4m life insurance. 

3. Jealous competition. Very slim chance of that too. This man was head and shoulder above local competitors. He didn't have fights with anyone. He didn't dine in the local bars or get in the way of the businesses around his.

So who killed this businessman described as an amazing go-getter with legit achievements?

His abandoned car led to a number of unusual suspects that finally got to the killer...

A bloody former call-centre employee of his vast empire!

You know how annoying this is when you are watching and waiting for the police to unravel top conspiracy from the corridors of power and influence... only to find out a nobody had some lazy ambition to take something from someone beyond his reach.

Why did this fool kill the man?

Because he wanted to steal his BMW!

This is one of the most annoying C&I episodes I have watched. I was so mad.

It is similar to living in the jungle, taming lions and leopards... only to be killed by a spider bite.

You'd think his death would be the scheme of top business politics and high-end greed from shakers of the community... only to realise a fool just wanted his car!

Like a billionaire getting killed by his neighbour's maiguard for his watch... something so disturbing and irritating.

Small people are everywhere trying to get something small from you... but hoping to take catastrophic actions to get it.

Small people want small things by making big mistakes. 

I see it all the time.

Small-minded peeps take really stupid actions just to meet their little greed.

This petty thief had approached the victim for a business idea which the victim was willing to listen to.

As the police said of the killer...

"He was a man who envied with a biting vengeance. He hated to watch others succeed where he believed he could but didn't."

This killer has an Ivy League degree...but that still didn't make him any bigger than an ant.

Why should a man so successful lose his life because of a BMW when he could conveniently afford ten newer brands?!

Murder is wrong on all counts... but to die in the hands of a small person is similar to dying of a headache in a city with impressive healthcare and spectacular medical development.

Every once in a while, bring out a sheet of paper and draw the pyramid. The people of least importance, you know them... put them far away.

Everyone knows the "small people" in their lives. 

If they'd remain small and insignificant, fine.

But no! Small people like big attention... like killing a man just to get his car.

Uugh!
