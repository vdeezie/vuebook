We do not question because we are in a society that disregards your right to ask questions...to be curious.

If that right is freely given to you this minute- to query, you will not know what to do with it.

You will not know the questions to ask.

It is like the goat that is finally free but still goes around in circles, never stepping out of line, not fully realising its liberties. 

Religion, Culture and Ageism are just a few of your enemies.

Religion is largely despised because it cannot truly be questioned. Religion wants followers, not leaders.

I was in a church once where we were told not to question. "Just obey," they said.

When I questioned I became the enemy. The one who had to be crushed.

In churches, givers don't know what really happens to their tithes and offerings. People who you think should come with some kind of intelligence will tell you to, "let God worry about it. Just give." Like a true zombie.

We have seen pictures of church addicts eating snakes and grass. And men of god stepping on human backs to preach, claiming that their status gives them these privileges to be lifted above the ground, and more.

Culture refuses to bend. Widows are first guilty before proven innocent with a cup made from the juice of washed corpse. And all other absurdities.

We have not questioned enough or stayed angry enough for that to change.

Culture hates to be judged.

Ageism. The old man is right, do not question his "wisdom". Ageism torments and silences.

There is no reason beyond the long gap between births that determine who should speak and who should always nod, but we apply this rule because questioning is out of it.

These are only a few of the reasons women, especially, remain subservient to institutions that have not been restructured for decades. Nobody is asking any questions.  No judgements permitted.

If you are not allowed to confront a system, how then can its methods be revised?

There are others, of course, other minor yet damning issues...

Some schools have scrapped PTA meetings. Why?

The constant questioning and judgments are privileges they do not appreciate.

PHCN has been giving me bills for months without electricity. I am almost hitting N100k. But I don't have light, so I can't understand what the bills are for. They drop the sheet by the door and walk away. Only for another bill to appear the next month.

There is no easy legal system to address this injustice. We do not have an easy legal system for consumers to query instituions...because Nigeria hates to be interrogated.

When I applied for my United Nations ground pass, I had thought of the process to be as hectic as trying to register in a tertiary institution in Nigeria. The number of windows you need to queue to get a reluctant signature.

When I got to NewYork, it took barely 5 minutes to get a ground pass, with the documents I had.

I have never had it that easy to register for anything my entire Nigerian life.

We create all that jigsaw because we need to make it very difficult for anyone to track back to a point of accountability. Of interrogation.

We want Nigerians to remain clueless, grateful, humble, needy, lacking any kind of curiosity that would make them want to speak differently from the uniformed manner that is silently approved.

As if we do not have enough shackles on every part of our moving body...we build our own prisons.

We join groups that do not respect the most important liberty of the present Woman...

The liberty to Question.

Go to a police station to ask questions, you'd be rebuked...or even placed behind bars for being "too forward" "rude" "uncooperative".

Your judgments make everyone uncomfortable. 

From your parents...when you were 8 and you had something to say during family TV hour. You were sent to your room (or your mat) for opening your mouth to speak when mummy and daddy were speaking.

In school, you were flogged for questioning the teacher who spelled "Oxen" as "Oxes". How dare you! Let her get it wrong but you quietly hold the truth in your heart without questioning.

That is how we are.

When you became a woman, you were told not to question your husband. "Just do as he says; don't provoke him. That way you will have a happy marriage."

How can you be happy when you have no voice?

YET, Nigerian women seek more ways to place whatever is left of their liberties under scrutiny.

They join secret groups.

Let me ask a question...

What are you so afraid of? 

What scares you so much that you have to be in groups and cliques and gangs to breathe?

Why do you try to hide your identity under more structures? 

It is common practice for a woman to sit alone at a bar having a drink in New York. Security is not going to push her out and label her a prostitute.

She has rights. The system is aware that she is a complete human being all by herself without attachments of a man or other women.

In so-called 4-star hotels in Nigeria, a woman is harassed by security at the gate for being alone. As if it is a crime to be woman and be whole.

If she isn't coming with loud friends or a male companion, then she is incomplete. Not human enough. Therefore cannot buy drinks in the hotel or bar.

If you sit alone at,  say, Freedom Park, everyone is going to look at you like you need company or a hug.

Because if a woman is not loud or amongst many other people...then she must be sad or rejected...

Or Broken.

These are scientific evaluations made by other women. 

So off we go attaching ourselves to groups, so that...God forbid...we be seen as unhappy.

We gather our commonsense into a bin bag and jump into secret groups because if we aren't part of that then it would mean we are missing out on something... something phenomenally female.

So you are in a group where you cannot interrogate, question or judge.

You are fuelling the same systems that have kept us under for so long. Yet you are some kind of feminist.

So when women tell stories in these groups that make you want to pull out your hair...you'd just have to fight the urge to speak. You remain quiet. 

The kind of quiet they suffer in church when the pastor tells them their tithes will be used to build a jacuzzi for the man of god so he can be washed by the holy ghost every morning.

It is the kind of quiet the followers of Jim Jones suffered when he told them the world was coming to an end.

Foot soldiers are the worst in any gathering. They know very little, yet they spread themselves thin enough to be defenders at every door without blood on it.

You have 21 year olds in these groups...and you deny that generation the opportunity to question, to tear down, to appraise, to judge.

It is what we do to the Nigerian child when we refuse to allow him tear his toy apart to understand the mechanics behind coupling a race car.

You deny him the ability to groom common sense. To be better than a dirty shirt in a laundry basket.

I am sorry for you. 

All of you.
