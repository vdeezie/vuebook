My children will never sit to listen to any baby boomer give any kind of advice.

I don't care if it is the President of Nigeria. If he wants to meet with 100,000 young Nigerians, my children will not be part of that mess.

Let him fix the roads that will lead them to the gathering first.

Unless it is a gathering of baby boomers APOLOGISING to Nigerians for how they wrecked this country and finally owning up to being epic failures and disasters... nothing else would do.

Save your sermons. Don't tell us how to be great when you can't provide any working institution that can align with the dreams and potential of the young.

I will never intentionally attend an event that will have me listening to a baby boomer speak. I will pull my hair out first.

All that patronizing bullshit...

"You must work harder and harder..." "You must be great"

How? With the saliva coming out from your mouth?

Nigerian youths will be great. How???

We dig deep into our religious hypocrisy to heal our incompetence and corruption. We trade common sense for spiritual performance. 

We badger young people and tell them they are "unserious". 

Baby boomers think you are unserious. They need to check their heads.

If they lived serious lives, we would have subways in Lagos... we would have futuristic straddling buses in Abuja... we would have healthcare facilities to tackle terminal diseases like cancer and diabetes, and 18-hour electricity at the least. 

They failed. Yet they refuse to relinquish power or die.

There are 67-year-old fathers abusing and harassing their children to "be great" from their one-bedroom with two wives and 9 children.

You need to turn to a father like that and tell him to "sod off". Tell him you "got this". Tell him greatness will be defined by you not by anything he has to say.

It is easy for him to wank on two wives, fuck a few concubines and probably an underaged breadseller while he pretends to dream big for you.

He dumped you in a public school with no toilet and teachers' brains as useful as septic tanks...yet he expects greatness.

There is no space to read in a one-room with 8 siblings and three adults... food is never enough. Even oxygen is scarce in your life. Yet papa wants you to be successful by insulting you everyday and calling you "useless child".

The irony.

When your mother who sells "provision" gave him your school fees so it would give the impression that he is the provider, he used the money for alcohol and whoring...

Yet that father has a cane waiting to see your report card.

Why don't you grab that cane from him and flog the shit out of his own delusions?

If your father wasn't so dramatic...and is in government, using OUR money to see you through school in a first world nation... he too should share the same spot in hell.

The worst sight ever is seeing a baby boomer in government attend an event, surrounded by young  people taking selfies with him and applauding his "contribution to nation building".

It is why even the youth have no sense of direction. 

How do you applaud any baby boomer in Nigeria for "nation building"?

Our perfect art of pretention and amnesia soaked in schizophrenia is a worse plight than the fiasco of the boomers.
