"I can't think of any part of civilisation created by people of colour."

In 2016, a congressman in America said that while responding to questions on the "white leadership" of the Republican party. He said whites are at the centre of civilisation.

It is largely ignorant to say this but... who will blame him?

Isn't Nigeria making big plans to produce pencils in 2018?

Isn't our biggest achievement still the ability to say "yes" to a lover and own a big wedding your bank account cannot justify?

How many people have heard of Andela? 

It is a tech startup owned by young Nigerians operating IN Nigeria... and Zuckerberg pumped $24m into their company. 

Twenty-four million dollars.

But you don't know. That is not the kind of achievement that grabs your attention.

Did it even trend on Twitter Nigeria?

Oh! Aren't weddings trending?

That's what pricks our interest. That's what we appreciate as true success.

We don't know about Andela because we are busy celebrating what matters most- weddings and births.

And when we aren't doing that, we are bashing and defending religion.

When we get wet with sweat over that one, we move to building idiotic support for PDP or APC.

We waste too much time on nothing...and so the only thing we can create in another two years is...

Pencil.

Congressman is wrong though. Egyptians were one of the most prolific inventors... but that was centuries ago.

In 2016 your race is questioned for contributing nothing to civilization except celebrating multiple births at 60...

(Sincerely, I am yet to understand why that is anything but a disaster. A 60 year old woman clutching triplets in a church and everyone celebrating. What does a 60 year old woman need newborns for? How's she going to take care of them? How long is she going to live before making it the responsibility of another human being? Is she, at 60, still gainfully employed to provide? Or will she be relying on gods? It is a miracle alright, but is it even bloody necessary?)

We may claim the rights of inventions of centuries gone. But you are here now...

Apart from fucking and feeding and faffing...

What really are you here for?

You can get mad at white racist congressmen for being politically incorrect...

But you know deep down there's truth lurking in there.
