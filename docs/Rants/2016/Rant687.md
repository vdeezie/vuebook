One of the first things you need to tell your growing child is...

Stop being afraid of people hating you.

I cannot understand this obsession with Love.

Especially random Love from people who don't pay your bills.

The kind of Love that breeds fear.

Fear that will not let you live your truth...or speak your mind.

Because you want to be "loved".

Love that cheers on mediocrity.

Your voice has been smothered by this "love"... your tail in between your legs for the sake of this mediocre love...

A love that ensures you live "right" according to the dictates of a million other fearful stifled voices in a loud chorus. 

Be different. No.

Be better. No 

Be phenomenal. No

You live everyday waiting for someone to bash someone else so you can jump on the bandwagon truck heading to nowhere. 

That is the only time you have a voice- in the midst of a hundred frightened voices too petrified to stand alone.

Your bandwagon love ensures you what exactly?

I can't understand it.

How can average be appealing to anyone?
