Everyday after work, I head to The Palms to get a cup of Kiwi icecream.

First I get into Shoprite to buy a pack of Oreos biscuit. And I crush the entire pack into my Kiwi icecream. Sit at the back of the car and eat my icecream.

It is a very important ritual. It gives me happiness.

At the moment, I am heading to The Palms to watch a movie. Again, I do this every other day.

I get up, call the driver and head down to Lekki to watch a movie or two.

Sometimes, like now, I don't know what is showing. But walls cave in...so I get out to find some happiness.

You will find me at a corner seat. Alone. With a blanket and a pack of popcorn.

These are my addictions.

For some others, the excitement of weddings is what keeps them alive.

Yes, I am still on this Gbemi/Olumofin issue.

The danger of bias.

If you analyse an issue from the beginning...you will clearly see where wrong is committed. 

In this matter, Gbemi is a bully.

It reminds me of secondary school and the methods of bullying. 

I wasn't bullied because I was the type to start cursing people from the front of the hostel to the back. I was mostly left alone.

But we know how terrible bullies are.

Cyber-bullying is worse. And it doesn't always start from your bias...

It starts from the beginning. 

And as far as Gbemi and the Olumofin brothers go...

Gbemi is the bully.

People have been mocking two-brothers-who-crash-weddings for quite some time.

It is so bad that when Gbemi subbed them, the Island caucus knew exactly who she was referring to.

Someone tweeted and described one of the brothers as a quack doctor. 

"Are you referring to the quack doctor?"

And Gbemi laughed.

It is not right.

Yet we are all obsessed with the brothers' reactions.

What do you expect?

It is ok for friends to gossip about these things. It is not ok for one of them to bring it to social media and think it is something that shouldn't cause any attack.

I am starting a radio station. I am pushing a PR campaign for my presenters...

Some people have called me to ask if they can be part of it. 

Would it be fair to go on twitter and tweet:

"See ehn, if you have not been invited to be part of Happenings radio, don't take it personal. Stop asking to be part of it."

Isn't that exactly what Gbemi did?

Isn't that speaking right from the anus?

I know what it feels like to be different. To desire something a little more than is necessary. 

I have that kind of relationship with Kiwi icecream. My waist is expanding, but it's small price for this love.

It's probably the way these brothers feel about weddings.

I find cinema ambience therapeutic. I don't feel the same way about weddings. I don't attend weddings. At all.

But...you don't know what this obsession with high class weddings do for these brothers...

The demon it subdues.

Although I think they are a bit too obsessed. I mean, filming your face at the wedding to show you were present is tacky as hell...

But let it be their problem. Let it be their demon to cast.

Abeg I don reach cinema. Make I go watch feem.
