Question: Why is it only Joy and xxx staying at Transcorp Hilton and not all of us, especially me- with all my fancy degree and world class experience in the corporate world. 

Answer: I am the convener. Xxx is my speaker. It is a woman like you that called me to invite 10 of my friends for a trip to Abuja to carry on the conversation on gender equality that we started in Lagos. She doesn't have two heads. She is not older than you. Besides, there was a story behind the Transcorp matter. The entire week was booked by APC folks at the time...

But wait, even if it wasn't. Is your ass too thick for an alternative?

Q: When do I get to speak at THE Conversation? I am more experienced with fancy degree and world class corporate experience than all these ones. I can't learn much from them

A: Please have your world class corporate experience for breakfast. I don't care about world class nothing. I choose from my gut. Shonda Rhimes calls it the "huuum". Go and impose yourself on someone else.
#

Q: Joy you have to stop using vulgar words when you write. Be prim and proper. With class. It makes me uncomfortable.

A: When you were hustling to buy ticket to be Joy's friend...jumping fence and choking my space with your presence...telling me how "wuuuunderful" I am...prophesying into a future with many partnerships between us...

Did you not see all the fucks I do not give? Did you not meet me this way, oh self-imposed fairy godmother.
#

Q: Now you are forming busy. So you can not come to my house again abi?

A: You should be busy yourself. Women need to get busy. Sleepovers are for kids. We have work to do- we need to change this society. How about you get over your self.
#

Q: Joy please tell me anything. I am here for you. I see the future. You will be great. With my fancy degrees and world class corporate experience, I am equipped to solve your burning issues. I believe that a problem solved is...yada yada...

A: Ok. Since you asked, and you have been badgering me to be mothered by you, let me share this: I wasn't happy what X did and T did. How do you think I should handle it?

A few weeks later...

"Oh Joy is a terrible person. Do you know what she said about X and T?" 

PS: Sigh. Nigerian women are we still at this lowly point. I am a terrible person, yes. But not in that lousy manner. There is nobody I cannot speak to directly. Gossip lives beneath me.
#

You badger me. Throwing advice I dont need or appreciate. You come into my life to turn me to someone else. Like your little lab project. What is that?

You are rolling with whoever you are rolling with now because I refused to be nurtured by you like a baker nurtures mixed flour in the oven.

I am not one of those women looking to be saved by someone who thinks- because of her corporate privileges and status- needs mothering. 

I have a lousy degree from THE polytechnic Ibadan. I haven't lived outside Nigeria...

Yet you with all your fancy degrees and world class corporate experience have your hands cupped under my vagina... waiting for urine to fall so you can wash your face with it.

I will say it here again...

You are a disgrace. Your years in corporate world and your fancy education are a waste.

You are feeding off my glory, my successes and my mistakes. 

You are a substandard mascot. A clone from the remnants of my yesterday.

Your mates are building empires. See what Stephanie Okereke has achieved with movies. She what Opeke has imagined with technology. See what women are doing with the platforms they have.

But YOU...you have spent the entire time trying to hook up with Joy's supposed haters to rally some kind of ambition.

What is this called- Mid life crisis?
#

So the question was: Joy why do you cut people off so quickly?

Here lies the answer.

I am a mother to two children. They are the only ones I will slave for emotionally. They are the only ones I will torture my brain to understand their motives.

Everyone else will have to come as plain as a sheet of paper, with commonsense into this business of living.

Turn your hate and bitterness to fire. Burn this world with your presence. Then I can respect you- whether you are a friend or not.

Anything else is just talk and shit.

And far as your records go, you are on poop level.

I take back my friendship. You are undeserving.
