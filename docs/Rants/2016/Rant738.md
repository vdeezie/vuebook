"Someone says you should think humility as regards to your request to seek for a husband."

"Oh?"

"Expecting a rich husband is an affront to culture and patriarchy. She admonishes you to change your mind."

"Isn't she like an ex-prostitute?"

"Something like that."

"How does she get to tell another woman what brand of marriage to aspire to when she had enjoyed the support of men, rich in most cases, to sustain a lifestyle that is both morally corrupt and criminal?"

"Beats me."

That is how people hold conversations. 

When we attack a slut-shaming tradition, we attack tangential thoughts and opinions. Erratic thinking. Arguments that derail from previous course.

These are things we attack.

BUT when you sit in judgment of what brand of husband another woman should have, playing judge to her desire of a rich man... then you put your own history of affairs and trade in line to be scrutinised.

Someone did say I was trying to grab the attention of her boyfriend once; subbed out on a post she titled: Gaining Emotional Intelligence 

It was germane to the theme of discourse to question her own Emotional Intelligence in regards to men and sex.

And so I did.

"Jeez, did you read that? She questions your integrity with her man!"

"Yes I did. But this is coming from someone who has been with a shitload of men from a certain industry. How much Emotional Intelligence did she apply to those sexual romp?"

That attack is perfectly in order.

The theme on Emotional Intelligence and being accused of hitting on a man is analogous to that of a woman who applies none of it to her sexual exploits...

Which I would never have a problem with if she wasn't being hypocritical, judgmental and downright idiotic. 

Nigerian women, by nature, gain confidence by projecting their issues on the next woman. They expect that you should carry a bag of debauchery on their behalf the minute they can gather three or more "friends" to cry out "victim".

The part where slut-shaming is absolutely ridiculous is in every other dealing...

Getting your car fixed, and being tagged a whore for driving or coming to the mechanic by yourself. 

Crossing the road and being called "ashawo" for the nerve of you to have a buttocks that rotates. 

Having a strong voice on issues affecting women and children and be termed bitter and sexually frustrated.

Having any regular fights that deteriorate to the abuse of the vagina.

These are unacceptable and clearly puerile and brainless arguments.

-Because of our lack of rational thinking, we admit many divergent tripe in a single argument.

We move from... "Why did she question my big tummy" to... "She is just a prostitute, shebi she slept with a lizard" 

All in two seconds. Because no sense. And no vocabs.  

Thank you.
