I'm getting bicycles for my girls.

Ife is really tall and it's tough finding a bike that is girly and high enough to fit.

I tell her to sit on a bike so I can determine her comfort. 

One random idiot houseboy and his gang- three jobless worthless no-gooders from the other shop where they sell a bunch of trash that nobody buys, said in Igbo...

"How can they buy bikes for big girl like this kwa?" And they laughed. 

So I turned to him...ignoring Ife's plea in her eyes to ignore them.

"Just because your mother deprived you of everything- education, food, shelter, and something as frivolous as a bike, should not be my headache. This is what you have become- a fucking nobody who sits at the edge of a shop, waiting for sales, passing all your frustration to people living their lives... SUBBING people better than you."

He frowned and said in pidgin, "madam nor curse me oh!"

"I don curse you already. Curse your own. Don't cry just yet. Don't start claiming I am insulting your child or your domestic pet just yet. Open your fucking mouth and curse your own. Let me finish you this afternoon!"

"Ha! Madam. Na play I dey play nah."

"My daughter is 11 years old, you ugly shit. She is taller than you, wiser than you, better than you."

I moved closer...

"Spell 'Retard'..." I said.

"Madam, abeg e don do"

"I say spell RETARD, dumbfuck!"

"Hian! Madam I nor be rentand oh!"

Now my girls are laughing. 

I move even closer... 

"Do not project your luckless ugly life on me. People are not blind. They can see who needs a bit of luck."

I know, right? This is not about him at all, abi?

Kikikikiki. But it sha felt good. Nansense. He should chook his comment into his anus. 

Next time he will let young girls buy bicycles without his shitty brain spewing opinions. 

Anyway... the bicycles were too small sha. Jolade's size is easy to find, so no rush. Still searching for something cool for Ife the diva.

Any idea where I can buy cool bicycles in Lagos for the coolest kids ever? ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
