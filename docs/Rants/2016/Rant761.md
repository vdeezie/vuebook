December 15, 2016

I am invited to speak at an event.

I instruct a colleague to cover it.

I tell her to report the event and post immediately on the site.

The day ends, yet no post on the site.

I get to the office the next day.

She drivels on about the theme of the event being "too controversial", "not our kind of news", "not good enough for our platform", "not exactly what our audience would like to read".

"This LGBT theme... I don't want it to offend readers," she says.

And it takes her 30 minutes to find the words because they are stuck on the roof of her mouth. Her disgust precedes her words. 

An intern makes that decision all by herself after an express instruction to write an intro - not even a critique oh... just a bloody intro to launch the pictures she took at the event.

She makes a decision from the bowels of her ignorance that this isn't good enough to be published.

I lose my mind completely!!! 

(Oh! You should have seen how my madness sat on my head like a tiara. I was totally nuts out of my skin).

The nerve!! The flipping nerve!!!

"How dare you?!" I am enraged. 

You know how every second something plays back and you go, "Ahn Ahn! What the flipping fuck was that all about?!"

I've been doing that all day.

What is wrong with people?

No. Really. What the fuck is wrong with people???
