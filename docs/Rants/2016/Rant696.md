Yesterday...

After Read & Grill, Prisca and I went to the movies to catch 'The Mechanic' with Jason Statham.

Under the loud music...

Two men walked to their seats. Their words asphyxiated by cinema theatrics. 

When the loud clash and clatter of movie previews suddenly stopped...we caught the hem of their conversation.

In Yoruba, one said:

"We should have brought those small-small girls with us to this dark movie hall so we can finger them oh!"

The other nodded.

They had wedding bands on.

I know this is some kind of joke for the larger audience of Mass Nigeria. 

People would laugh it off as another men-will-be-men crap.

Nigerians find sexual debauchery funny when it comes from men.

Misogyny is casual humour dished out by men. No big deal.

But these are the men you are getting married to.

These are your husbands. 

Our moral expectations of men are so low, it's disgraceful. 

Religion isn't questioning male lechery and perversion... the preacher is only interested in boys who can make money.

These fools are perverts. They would rape a 13 year old neighbour... yet the wife will remain with them, counting her losses if she were to do the right thing.

Just so you know, your "crowning glory" is fingering small-small girls at cinemas.

Ask yourself: Why does the 21st century woman who embraces new thinking...still wind up with a dickhead for a husband?

Why is your threshold for a partner abysmal?

Our men are not evolving because we grab them from shelves like products about to sell-out.

I have been alone since December.

This celibacy thing happened to me. 

Trust me, I'd rather be fucking from every corner of a house...even on top of a chandelier.

But look around you. Get into a conversation with a Nigerian man. Pass through the facade...see what you find.

Don't tell me I have not met the "right ones". Even your bourgeoisie hero falls below the mark in sexual propriety. 

Men are staring at the buttocks of 12 year olds.

To find the exception...you'll have to keep digging like you are looking for precious stones. It is not a compliment. It is insane.

Our crop of men and their lack of sexual sophistication is repugnant.

From fathers to brothers to husbands to colleagues to sons...

It is time we question the sexual integrity of Nigerian men.

PS: Save the "all men are not like that" sermon. I know. That is not the point. Still.
