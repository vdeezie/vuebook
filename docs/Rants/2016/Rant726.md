I am watching Crime and Investigation. 

A 13 year old child has been killed by his schoolmate.

The detective has to do the hardest part of a homicide job - tell the parents that their baby is gone.

Joe Kenda, the detective, is standing by the door of the parents' home... they open the door, he informs them of the sad news...

The mother goes to a chair, pulls out a cigarette... smokes and sobs.

She is white. Brunette. American.

The detective understands it is perfectly normal for a (wo)man to grieve this way. Nobody judges her.

Now, switch the race and nationality...

Would it still be explained as grief in Nigeria if a mother becomes so hungry all of a sudden by the news of death that she'd draw out a bowl of amala?

Not at all. If she isn't pulling out her hair, then it isn't grief enough.

Imagine your neighbour losing her 13 year old child... if she refuses to dance to a particular tune of grief... she'd be branded a witch!

I watched an episode once where a grieving mother would dress up, wear all her makeup and take long walks everyday. The community empathised with her kind of grief. No judgments. Nobody badgered her about not rolling on the floor and shouting and catarrh inducing lamentations.

Not that there is anything wrong with elaborate grief... but is it always genuine? Our methods are so insane that we even hire loud annoying mourners to spice up our grief. 

It is possible to grieve and head to work the next day... because the walls in your home are closing in on you, and you are losing your mind.

For men, I think society understands when they need to live without any script...

But women? Of course, the bearers of all burdens cannot mourn with a cup of coffee... woe betide you if you don't grieve by crying aloud daily and refusing food.

How dare you grieve with a cup of coffee?! Milk? What? Is that grief?!

In Nigeria, you should NOT be able to eat or shower. If you get hungry, then you'z the killer.

Is there anything that is not a performance in Nigeria?

I watched a girl mourn her father's death by enrolling in modelling class. 

A psychologist said of her... 

"The colours of fashion will help with her depression... the energy on the runway will keep her happy..."

That's grief.

Bye.
