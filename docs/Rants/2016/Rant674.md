Nigerians, lose your shame.

There's nothing like "Marriage shame"...

If you do not want to get married, do not!

There's nothing like "bourgeoisie shame"...

If you do not have the financial muscle to rent a house in Lekki, do not.

There's nothing like "single parenting shame"...

WTF! You an amazing parent (unless you are not, then you are a disgrace). I won't trade this single parenting for half the marriages I know! 

There's nothing like "career shame"...

If you are a security guard, guard that gate like it is the most important gate in the world.

There is no shame, except the ones we endorse. Or create.

What you need to do, dear Nigerians, is flip all the shame you nurse for shamelessness...

And vice versa.

Be ashamed of your political affiliations that continue to deprive us of growth. And not of your convictions of a new Nigeria away from these political clowns.

Be ashamed of religion that eats your common sense. And not of your desire to think out of spiritual manipulation. 

Be ashamed of the traditions that still allow women to be fed fat to meet the standards of mere men... and widows treated like dogs. And not of your need to embrace true civilization. 

I heard of Malawian "hyenas" this afternoon. Men who fuck virgins to prepare them for marriage. It is a job. And families in Africa gather to celebrate this.

It is still happening in 2016.

Africans are fucking as a career... as the rest of the world is building new technology. 

Be ashamed of that. 

Be ashamed of the shame that you have for being different, and thinking differently. 

You can't shame me oh.

Walahi! I have no shame. I revel in the attempts at being shamed.

I am different. I think differently. There's no gaddamn shame in that!

Lose that shame.

Free yourself of unnecessary burdens.

If your shame is not going to give us electricity and finish the rail tracks at Orile...

Then what's the point?

Let's kick all that shame to our leaders and political holders.

It's their responsibility to carry that burden...

Not ours.

Signed: Shameless Me,

Joy.
