Nigerian feminism is not empowering women.

Nigerian feminism is empowering a few women of like-minds. These like-minded women do not have any affiliations to or genuine interest in other women beneath a pretend social strata.

Feminism marginalises women even greater than Patriarchy.

Many women are excluded from the network. In instances where feminism tries to be inclusive, it always (and I mean, always) derails into an abyss of "ersatz feminism" (I made that up) that suggests my-ways-are-better-than-yours.

Feminism is narrow and closed. It functions like an elitist club with no money, of course. Just a lot of talk.

The general idea of feminism leans on economic empowerment, so there's a lot of braggadocio and falsification of bank statements and financial muscles of women who need to remind themselves constantly that they are more entitled than how men and other women assume them to be.

They don't go very far. Patriarchy is deep-rooted. It'll take more than merely proclaiming how you "bloom in the morning" to shake it off.

Patriarchy is just there looking at you. 

Not many feminists are working hard enough to really be able to afford their own lake house. They think about it. They rant about it. But the physical proof of independence is a far cry.

PS: The very successful women I know are not feminists. The friend who paid my child's school fees in 2008. And the women who I have worked with who have paid my salaries. And those I am running projects for. They live by feminist principles without engaging in the constant conflicting opinions of the Nigerian version.

And feminists should please leave married women alone. If you are married to a good man in this Nigeria of badly behaved men... Let me tell you, it is an achievement!

Leave married women to gloat in this sheer and rare "luck" of husbands who are not kicked in the groin daily by patriarchy, or those unwilling to unlearn. 

Feminism should go and get Habiba Isa, the child bride, from the Emir's house. Feminism should write to the government authorities to change the Social Studies textbooks in primary schools where that dirty LIE about women staying in the kitchen is boldly printed and taught to our children. 

Nigeria women are picking and dropping feminism at every convenient occasion. It stands for nothing other than Convenience.

There's got to be a little more to your Feminism than reaffirming that you will not cook everyday or wash clothes with bare hands... and how you plan to retaliate when a cheating husband happens upon you. 

We have heard. 

Sincerely you are as grating as religious fanatics to the outside world.

And this instant shock and clampdown on reasoning beyond enclosed feminist circles... This cheering on of frivolities (e.g: how I was able to get up and feed my 8 months old baby even when patriarchy tried to tell me my baby is just a girl), should please wither like leaves in winter.

You are beautiful. You are strong. You can be weak. You can pay for your wine. You can twerk on a stool without judgment. You can have plenty sex and not be judged. You can wrap a napkin around your body and not be judged. You can be single and not be judged. 

Yes. Yes. We agree.

Everybody is trying to act tough.

We have been talking about the same wine-paying exercise for a long time. And how marriage is not our shit. And frying plantain is not our salt.

Do you plan to stay as stagnant and dictatorial as patriarchy?

Are you learning and unlearning at all?

Evolve nah.

Have you not yet become that which you most despise?

PSS: I know. I know. This offends you. But think.  Go and think about it.
