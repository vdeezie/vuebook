If you want dramatic change, if you seek any kind of social revolution of attitude and condition and operation... you must be willing to lose something. 

Not Nigerians.

Nigerians want good roads, technologically advanced trains to run from Lagos to Kano... Nigerians want traffic straddling buses like they have in China... 

Nigerians have dreamed of incredible development like they achieved in Dubai. They want a country on every tourist bucket list.

Nigerians want electricity like they have in the first world where you can sue for 3 minutes power-cut (that happens once in every decade) that made you slip in the dark and brush your elbow on your wall.

Nigerians want security. 911 dial. They want society and government to take rape cases seriously. Nigerians want corrupt politicians to go to jail. They want gender inclusion in government. 

Nigerians want good public schools so we can save the millions we spend every year in providing basic education for our children in private establishments.

We want business friendly environment for small business to get loans and potential for grants.

YET Nigerians are unwilling to lose anything to get what they want.

Even something as basic as the President's marriage.

Yes, I said it- BASIC. 

A marriage in a third world country is basic. His marriage doesn't need fixing, let him lose it if he has to, we still don't have potable water, so why should his marriage matter? Check out the shit that comes out of the taps in bourgeoisie Lekki homes. Pure shit! You can't take a bath with it. 

I don't care if a 73 year old man still gets regular sex... I am 39 and I don't! So what does it matter? We should all be having sex... we should all not be having sex... what does it matter what little pleasures you get, Nigeria is fucked anyways! And in a fucked up nation people should worry about other things. Let first world worry about cute little marriages. 

It's like a dirt poor child from Makoko holding a pack of biscuit to her chest with a big smile for the camera. She is still poor. The biscuit is not an investment into her future. It's just temporal nourishment and happiness. In the larger scheme of things, all of it doesn't count because this child is still deprived of a decent upbringing. 

That's the Nigerian situation in a nutshell.

Unlike many of you who vouch for the wonders Buhari will do, I am not a spider in the other room... I don't care for this man's marriage. 

His marriage doesn't need fixing... Nigeria needs fixing! He is the President!

It is called sacrifice. Check the sacrifices people and countries who want change have to make...

Find out what revolutionists renounce to get their desired results. 

See what true leaders have to lose to make their people great!

I don't know the sort of crap we are made of!

People are more concerned about Buhari's marriage to Aisha?????

Afraid we are trying to "break a home"????

Are you fucking kidding me?!

You are a Nigerian! You don't have a country! You don't have anything! Nothing!

There's nothing this country has done for me or my children. Nothing!

Yet, I should worry that Aisha has an opinion that might make her lose her marriage?!!

And you, Under-developed Nigerians are rebuking her for not being discreet, for calling out her husband in public. 

Shame on you!

You will never get anything if you don't lose something. 

I am a feminist in Nigeria... I should know! 

If you believe strongly in your revolution you will lose many things and many people. Revolution is not coffee and biscuit. It is social war!

In a fucked up country like Nigeria, nobody should be idle... we should all choose a cause and fight the necessary war!

Stop trying to save your pennies as you scrape the pieces of happiness you can find in this mess of a country. You deserve so much more but you don't know it... or too afraid to believe it.

It's the same way I feel about the girl child. I know our daughters deserve so much better than their share in this country.

Gosh Nigerians!

We don't have water to drink, damn it!

So fuck the President's marriage. He can be single for all I care.

Fuck your little parties you attend every Saturdays... fuck your happiness... and fuck you, Nigerians... for being so cowardly at every turn... always unwilling to make any kind of sacrifice for a better future for our children. 

See your churches... always turning a blind eye to Nigeria's woes whilst focusing on personal blessings. Christians actually believe Nigeria will fall, yet in the midst of a fall THEY will rise. In the midst of national failure, THEY will succeed. It is what they teach them- absolute selfishness. 

I have two girls and I will lose everything- and I mean everything, if it ever comes to that - to make sure that a social revolution on gender equality goes as far as I am able to achieve.

I will lose everything for that cause. Even a chance at "love". If it scares you that I am so unconventional, then you are one of the sacrifices that I will also have to make.

Sigh!

I don't know if a day goes by that I don't question my nationality.
