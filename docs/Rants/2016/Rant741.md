How much transformation has Feminism achieved in metropolitan Nigeria?

Not much.

There's a trend of hypocritical converts that portend more damage to the movement.

There are people who stand for feminist principles in text or as it applies to the randomness of conversation that cannot be traced back to them or have any direct social and personal benefit or snag.

They advise abused women to leave their abusive partners only when the relationship they share with the victim is casual and distant; not familial.

When it comes to family, there are different rules because we constantly need to save face in Nigeria. Our entire social credo is nurtured by outstanding duplicity and dishonesty.

There are different rules for the world that is denied in our personal family orbit as far as gender equality and feminism is concerned.

So we badger a relative to try and work it out with a man who punched her eyes out...

But away from home, within political correctness and social acceptance we practice sophistry like pure art without blinking; engaging in discussions that address abusive men and condemn the rationale of staying with them.

The true nature of us is within our most sheltered and secure circle. The quilt of family produces our true form.

It is what we tell our mothers, our sisters, aunties, nieces, cousins about gender abuse, sexism and inequality that demonstrates where we truly stand and who we really are.

It is not what we say when we ask for a mic to address a room of hundreds of people or when we come on social media to write or respond to cute posts about "allowing women opportunities like men".

Many social and virtual gender advocates are living a different reality at home where the real test of faith is required.

Many still beat their wives. Others will tell their cousins to "try to pound the pepper properly so he doesn't beat you again".

Knock on cyber doors of those who have led people to rid a widow of all her marriage worth... there you will find a deluge of convenient rants about women making smart choices by breaking glass ceilings or something like that; an attempt at poetry and modernism choking them and their hypocrisy. 

However, not all is gloom, when you take off a mask eventually there may be marks to suggest you've had it on for too long. 

We can start by addressing your deception and possible healing through those marks.
