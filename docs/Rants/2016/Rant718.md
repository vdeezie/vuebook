There’s the White Man – the first of society; privileged above all else.

The White Woman follows. Protected by police and conferred the true quintessence of femininity.

Then the Hispanic male, and all other race. Followed by their women.

The Black Man is here, below the ranking. But above, very much above... the Black Woman.

The Black Woman is at the bottom of significance. (This is where 99% of you start to pray: “Lie! I am God’s special child, His chosen one" I hear you!)

At the nethermost section of the world’s social order, Black Women are segregated yet (amongst themselves) by countless trifling issues…

Light skinned or dark skinned?

Big booty or small booty?

Pretty or un-pretty?

Fat or svelte or skinny?

Whore or Virgin?

Bourgeoisie accent or Local twang?

Fashionable or nah?

Naturalista or 16 inches mane-wearing apologist?

Diva or a Mop?

Married, Engaged or Single?

Children or nah?

Daughters or Sons?

Natural birth or Caesarean operation?

Husband faithful or Husband unfaithful?

Make-up or Make-down?

Heels or Flats?

Submissive or Rebellious?

Can she cook or nah?

Anti-feminist or Feminist?

Anti-religious or Religious?

Sexing for money or Sexing for pleasure?

Amber Rose inspired or Oprah Winfrey inspired?

Can she slay or nah?

Is she weak or nah?

Is she opinionated or nah?

Does she watch Telemundo or nah?

And the gaps keep increasing…

Until the poorest black women are left at the underbelly of society where dogs and lions- wild and domestic pets – rank higher and make more compassionate headlines than her needs and that of her children.
