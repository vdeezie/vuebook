Only the "poor" understands how poverty works. 

When a beggar comes to a car, knocking on the window, licking the sheen off the automobile, playing with the door handle, demanding to get your change...

The man at the backseat hardly budges. 

It is usually the driver that, after a while, frowns and gives a N10 bill.

The middle class smart-working dream-chasing goal-pushing individual does not understand the concept of giving continuously to a beggar who is never going to stop begging...

He doesn't understand giving to someone whom he would find at the same spot the next day and the next day and the next...stretching to years of begging or demanding for "money to buy pure water".

Mr. Middle-class believes only in growth.

If he gives N10,000...he expects you to return with N50,000 after a few months, or weeks... depending on your business strength and passion.

It is the way his world functions. It is his understanding of giving.

Giving must multiply. Like a seed on fertile ground.

If that isn't happening then it does not require attention.

The driver who gives, gives out of a compulsion to "shame" his boss...who clearly remains unashamed for good reasons.

So when a driver tosses a N10 note to the beggar, it is in protest to his Oga's silence and indifference to an everlasting beggarly trait of one who trains not only himself but his children to beg and run after shiny vehicles. 

People who make money cannot give regularly to someone who sits under the sun asking for N50 to buy gala year in year out. 

It is not wickedness. It is financial responsibility that they have embraced over the years. 

The same responsibility that allows them succeed despite Nigeria. They demand it of themselves and from others.

-Because they remember clearly what they did with the N2,000 daddy gave them when they were in 200Level....and how they doubled the money after investing in a small easy business in a week.

If Mr. Middle-class can have a conversation with a beggar, he would ask a simple question:

So when do you plan to gather all your beggarly funds of N50 and N100 over a period of time to buy a carton of gala to sell? Why are you still here after four years or more of constant begging and harassing? 

Some stories actually climax with the Middle-class giving a sum for a carton of gala or business of choice to the beggar...beggar will disappear for one week...but this quickly goes limp after a week, as beggar reappears at the same spot, to do what he does best.

I think beggars and the bourgeoisie clan understand themselves.

That is your answer to what you see everyday in traffic...

When the big boss is reading his papers, looking away from the forehead stamped on his window by a street urchin...But the driver is "moved" to part with N5.

People who work really hard and make more money from every naira cannot justify a seed that never grows.
