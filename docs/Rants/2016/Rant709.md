We are barely 30 million people in Lagos. 

The number of women and girl children could be half that population. 

We have over one thousand NGOs catering to these numbers.

Yet NGOs from Nassarawa and Dongoyaro are building tents to meet the needs of Lagos women who are swamped already with the message of redemption.

Who then is redeeming the women in the North? Who is attending to the needs of girls in the North?

In my interview on The Spot on EbonyLife, Ebuka mentioned this. He asked when I will head to the North to speak?

I've been asked that question many times... and it is beginning to make a lot of sense.

I have never lived in the North. I've been to Abuja maybe three times... yet it is a convenient Northern example. 

I do not understand the needs of the women of the North. I have not yet built that passion. Never even picked up a Quoran.

The closest I've come to appreciating their struggle was reading Mona Elthaway's "Hymen and Headscarves". A heartrending experience of women of Islam and Northern issues.

Lagos and Ibadan are the cities I know. Yoruba is the language I understand. The culture of the SouthWest is what I dentify with. 

I know these ones. I can reach these ones. I speak to these ones.

It is too convenient, yes, but to cross over to the North... to learn their "language"... to understand the culture... to embrace their religion and mores... will require resources I do not yet have.

My question is: If people from the North are building charity projects in SouthWest...

Who then is taking care of the women in the North? 

How many credible projects and organisations are addressing the needs of the women in the North. 

Do they not need this message even more?

Isn't it a bit pretentious when we all gather in the city doing the same thing?

Stephanie Linus told me about the Kaduna TedX she was invited to. She wasn't sure if she should go. I told her GO. Go faster than you have ever responded to any invitation. Though the rural women may not be seated to listen to you (or even understand English), but their representatives may be present. It is a cycle and one way or the other it will get to them. 

She is going and I am grateful for that.

We need to break this Lagos cliquey charity parade and get real with our mission. 

Who is attending to the Northern girl sold into marriage at 13? Who? 

Why are we all in Lagos talking to 43 year old women who have refused to leave abusive marriages even when the doors are wide open and no strict religious punishments exist?

If you know any charity organisation or projects in the North, I'll like to know. Maybe hold electronic interviews to help them raise funds for rural northern areas where women are treated worse than an appendage.  

We can't save half of Nigerian women/girls and act like the remaining half don't exist.
