We went to the movies to watch Storks.

As simple as that. 

Lovely movie. Well worth the children's time.

Ok. 

After the movie, Jolade had to use the restroom. So we all decided to use the restroom.

It was while I was in my private space that I heard someone seriously scolding a child. 
Right there where I was peeing, I shook my head in disgust at the adult. I could tell it was a simple instruction on how to use the automatic tap. Any kid can get confused by that. Why wouldn't this terrible adult say it nicely. What's with all the demeaning words?

Ok.

So I come out of the toilet to discover that... IT WAS MY CHILD BEING REBUKED.

It was like a trance... like I was dead and the "toilet girl" (for lack of a better term) couldn't see that I was standing there as she slapped my daughter's hand off the tap and rebuked her.

I blinked. I turned my head to one side. I squinted until she looked like a dark tiny spot... then I said...

"Why did you just hit my child?"

It could have ended with an apology. You know, "sorry madam, I was trying to explain to her how to use the tap. I didn't mean to be so forward."

But no. Trust Nigerians. She had to "show herself".

Her response?

"Did I beat her?!" Her hands like the flaps of a penguin. She turned derisively to my daughter and said "Did I touch you?!"

It happened too quickly... I grabbed her by the neck, pinned her to the wall with one hand and deliberately spat my words all over her face. 

Her colleague pleaded, screamed, jumped... 

But I wasn't done. So as I had her by the wall, I asked to see the manager and get a proper apology from someone with any kind of education.

When another colleague met us, he apologised on her behalf...

But because Nigerians think it is their right to hit and verbally abuse children, the toilet girl was still offended that I roughened her because of a "mere child", so she muttered...

"Na because I dey work for toilet that is why she just dey grab me anyhow..."

So I grabbed her again, amidst pleas from her colleagues, and I told her...

"This has nothing to do with your position. If I can help it, I wouldn't respond to your kind- I see you in every corner and I am tired. You are fucking disrespectful to me and my child, that is why I will beat the shit out of you today."

Another parent came and poured his smile and plea all over me. So I let the toilet madam go.

Jolade was exhausted by it all. Ife was just amused.

I told them plainly...

The world will have to wait for me to die before it can get away with child abuse... on my own children!

WTF! Rubbish.
