There was a time, when my children were younger, I used to apply the spare-the-rod-spoil-the-pikin rule...then I applied my brain to the situation one day, and stopped.

They have been flogging Nigerian kids since 19-gorodom...

These Nigerian children are adults now...

The only thing these Nigerian adults really and deeply care about is getting married.

The nation is still an under-developed mess.

So what was the point of all that rod to your back if you can't fix something as simple as your own damn country or community?

All that flogging...yet all we have to show for it is a zeal to find missing ribs and missing loot

Your parents' spare-the-rod-spoil-the-pikin rule failed and is still failing.

We complain that "white kids" are rude and spoilt because no cane to correct them.

But they grow up to be adults and run first world nations...

Nations you and your battered back designed with rod marks will beg to visit and not return. Your back is now washing toilets and re-living the humiliation of being what your parents designed you to be.

The whip is a lazy way to train a child. 

Children are not goats. I know the whole "kid" thing confuses you sometimes...but if there's any animal between a child and an adult...

The adult would be the one with the problem. The goat.

Your fathers disciplined to humiliate. How can that be normal or civil?

Talk to your children. Make them understand why there are consequences for their (in)actions. 

Deprive them of certain comforts. Tell them to clean and sweep and wash tough spots around the house as punishment. 

Fashola had his thinking cap on when he banned that flogging shit in school.

Our fathers' generation failed us. Rod for no concrete reason. Bloody cowards. 

I am not one to flatter that generation.

Now we have men and women who cannot express themselves and their needs. And as consequences of abuse, cannot express their vision/ambition/purpose.

Our fathers built homes but they left the entire nation to rot. They wanted obedient children who will not question their excesses and their failings. 

Zombies. 

It is still in that zombie act that we ALWAYS carry on like those guys were the shiznit.

They abused you. Period. 

Don't abuse your own children.

Period.
