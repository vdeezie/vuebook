Hahahahhaha! 

And then there is TB Joshua and his wack prophesies.

Trust religion to wriggle out of this one.

Shebi I have seen people pray on a dead body to get it to walk again. When they couldn't give breath to the lifeless, they called it the "will of god". So if it is the will of god, why the hell were you praying for days, you dumbfucks.

When tough miracles fail, they return to preaching about prosperity. 

Religion of predictable balderdash. 

You need a fucking idiot to prophesy that you can buy a car? A car??? Something millions of people already own? You call that a miracle? Are you a tree?!

You need a moron to tell you that you can finish school? Build a house? Take care of your kids? Buy a suit?

You need an intercessor for these trifling stuff? You need a mediator to help you tell a god to help you pass a flimsy JAMB exam? 

You are giving testimonies for things "sinners" achieve everyday. 

What a fucking mediocre god you must have. What an idiot your mediator must be. What an asshole you are!

TB Joshua will tell y'all that god finally spoke to him a minute ago that he has changed his mind, Trump for the win! 

And y'all will clap and believe. 

Lol!

Religious folks deserve TB Joshua. You all deserve the religious leaders in your life. 

Organised religion will remain the craziest most idiotic thing ever made by man.

Science has shown humanity more love than any religion. Science has saved the world countless times. Science clothes us in dignity. Science loves and keeps loving. Science gives and keeps giving.

But do we show it mass love and respect?

No. We use science for all our problems and then fling it to the side because we need to manufacture our own idea of a miracle. It is not a miracle, it is SCIENCE. 

Show some respect, you trifling religious hoe!

What has religion done for you apart from the perpetual promise to kill your perceived enemies, and bless you with a fucking car?

Stupid. 

Some retarded human who is able to die in a plane crash like the rest of us will come and tell me he is sent by god to make prophesies.

If not for anything, Trump winning is delicious just so my timeline will not be soaked in disgraceful worship at the feet of that coconut head called TB.

Ugh!
