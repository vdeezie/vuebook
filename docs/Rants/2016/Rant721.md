Perhaps there's a reason schools hold PTA meetings on weekdays at, say, 3pm.

Perhaps they expect the parents of their students to run traditional homes where father goes to work and mother stays at home, available for all school errands.

Perhaps I'm over-reacting when I say it pisses me off when they expect me to be available for a 3pm meeting on a weekday. And when I am not, query the child. 

How do we then make the money to pay for private schooling if we are available by 3pm on a weekday?

Let us pretend that these meetings are not merely ways to cure cancer with panadol.

Not every home is a traditional home. 

I am a single parent.

I left a husband so I can be happy and independent to pursue my life as I want as an adult (you can plug that in during your next grasshopper meetings of mob action... for spice and rubble). Some women are not cut out for traditional anything. I am one of them. I am not conventional in anyway.

I like being a single parent to my girls, just as much as the next woman may love being married. 

I like shipping them off to my mum for the weekend so I can plug in as many events and movies and literature as I can find... just as much as the next woman may love having children around, cleaning and instructing and babysitting. 

I like living alone and being in total control of my hour and my life... just as much as the next person may like a big family and noise and fart.

Public and private institutions should understand that single parenting has come to stay, and there's nobody available for a damn meeting on weekdays by 3pm if at all they are going to get the money to pay for the next term... which is always a flimsy 13 weeks away.

We cough out thousands and thousands of naira every 13 weeks. How can we be available for weekday PTA gatherings?

I am a single parent means I do not get dressed in boubou and ruby woo and sunscreen just to pick up my kids after school. 

If you manage to bump into me during pickup... amongst the other parents, you'd most likely mistake me for the sister-of-the-parent or in worse instances, the maid.

I have flipflops on, my curls are scattered, and I appear in pajama bottoms!!!

The horror!

But I don't make it to pickup as often as I should... BECAUSE I AM A SINGLE PARENT.

And what do single parents do?

They work and work and work.

In my case, I am lucky, because I love my job and I take on as many projects as possible. I haven't turned down a movie script or play or project in months. I take them all because I have found a method to making the most of 24 hours.

But to have me at PTA by 3pm...

If I have that free time, I will be doing something of immense pleasure instead.
