October 2, 2016

I was at the Film Festival yesterday mainly for the discussions on art and the future of film in Africa. 

I caught Femi Odugbemi’s Gidi Blues. Again. I had seen it at the cinema months back, and my sentiments remain the same- the typecast female perception and deductions from the movie. I wanted to know if he was more interested, as a movie practitioner, in reflecting society as it is or as he believed it should be.

So I raised my hand.

His response was helpful, and I agreed with his opinion on the strength of character of the women in the movie; albeit society’s assessment of their strength remains the biggest struggle. Still.

So I made it clear that as a feminist, I had issues with that interpretation. 

Taiwo Ajai-Lycett agreed, and at some point turned to me to advice on gender roles and how they fit into modern day feminism.

The session, presided by Oga Jahman, was regrettably short. It was the kind of session that could explore many other sub issues about Lagos duplicity, sexual hypocrisy, elite privileges etc.

Later, a man shook my hand and said, “Thank you for that question.”

Ok.

Afterwards, at the restroom, I met a girl, barely 18. She wouldn’t stop smiling at me, so I smiled back. She wanted us to talk about the question I asked.

“- Because I don’t understand why a girl should be called a tramp for liking sex,” she said.

Pause.

Now, that’s not the kind of discussion I have with teenagers. And I wasn’t sure how to steer the conversation to the right direction. I don’t know the right direction when it comes to girls and sex.

If she was an adult in her 30s or 40s then we could clampdown on sexual prejudices and reaffirm that our bodies and what we desire- whether in celibacy or in “active service” does not diminish a woman’s worth.

But a teenager… how do I navigate sexual sermons?

Like I told the teenagers from Ajegunle and Makoko at #TheConversation last week, I am not gifted in preaching sexual abstinence to any woman. I find that girls will have sex if they want to, no preacher has been able to save them from hormones.

You can talk about AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and the dread of sperm fertilising the egg in the aftermath of pleasure, but it has never really stopped anyone from having sex.

The most promiscuous girl I knew back then in higher institution was a pastor’s daughter who got rid of the guilt of a high libido by shaming other girls.

Deep down she didn’t think it was normal for a woman to be so “thirsty”. Yet she had zero control. For comfort, she threw her sexual frustrations on every other girl. 

She was the first to call someone “Ashawo” during a fight… just so it loses its flavour when it was repeated by the other. You know, she said it first, so at every point of reminding the next woman that she was a whore, she un-whored herself.

*Whew*

Women are a special breed, I tell you.

But that is how sex works in the reality of patriarchy and women who do not really know what to do with their urges and still want to appear as “good girls”. They fuck and then quote the scripture on their BBM. Some kind of balance- of shame and atonement.

So the 18 year old girl is happy I stated that a woman isn’t a tramp because she likes sex.

Err... I should have said something to admit the dynamics of age.

I am almost 40. You’d have to be a fathead, pea-brained to think sex-smears and slut-shaming will have any kind of effect on me, especially in the realm of imagination for entertainment. 

But she is 18 years old… I can’t project my confidence or conviction on a child.

For these ones, the conversation has to be slightly different. I think.

PS: I fried my hair and totally rocked a stripped shirt dress with purple heels. I was a bombshell.

Err... ask Onyeka Nwelue and Prisca Egbukuchi
