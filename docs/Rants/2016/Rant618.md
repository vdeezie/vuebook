I think a young lady, fresh out of an academy- something that probably provided knowledge on gender equality, put up an application for a...

Feminist job. 

You know how it is when you are excited about new information and you think of many ways you can apply it to society...

Especially a deadbeat one like Nigeria with plenty misogynists brandishing culture and religion as tools to ensure women remain oppressed.

So here is this lady and her demands for a feminist job.

Of course we all know that there is nothing like a "feminist job"...

She probably meant any establishment that deals with gender empowerment and social development.

But she's fresh out of an experience and she throws in the first word that clearly demonstrates what she wants.

But people-of-this-world aren't going to let her go away happy and fulfilled. 

They are going to remind her that feminism is still one of those tools for masturbation.

It is yet another ploy by these closet misogynists to mock.

And mock.

And mock.

Nicholas Ibekwe won't let this matter rest.

He is neck deep in ensuring feminism is dragged through this road with mud and ridicule.

"So you don't know feminism is being used as a racket by some," he tweeted. 

It's really not about what that lady said. To spend over 24 hours tweeting on one subject shows immense hatred and ignorance. 

If feminism will get that lady a job...

How is it any of your fucking business?

You forget so quickly...

How feminists rallied here to ensure you weren't intimidated by your colleagues and social media influencers when you had that battle with TB Joshua.

Feminists did efliers and campaigned against the harrasment. 

We played our small role in protecting you from wolves.

I fought my friend Onyeka Nwelue because of you.

We stood by you.

We were ready to sit in the rain for you. I knew how many 'feminists' reached out to support a post I did concerning that matter.

These feminists. 

Shebi you be Nigerian journalist?

You will need us again.

Because there are some battles you will not be able to fight alone...or with any other group. 

We shall wait for that hour.
