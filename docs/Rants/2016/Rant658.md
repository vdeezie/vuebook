Let me get this...

For years, Toni Payne was accused of sleeping with her husband's (9ice) friend, Ruggedman.

She insisted this was wrong.

No, actually she didn't insist. She was mute.

Why? We will never know. 

But she was mute on a false accusation for years whilst the ex-husband has had three other women and more children from these women. 

But Toni chose silence.

Women choose silence for many reasons, one of it could be for Love. That, somehow, he would find his way back to her.

Issokay.

The so-called friend, rapper Ruggedman, wasn't quiet about it though. He did everything to kill a bad rumour, even made a recording of a conversation between him and 9ice. Still the public wouldn't let Toni Payne off so easily.

Hundred years later, many women later, more children, eyes on local politics et al... 9ice finally has a statement out to address this, and he states clearly:

"She did not cheat on me."

Now the "world" is rejoicing: Toni Payne has been vindicated. 

Err...I beg your pardon?!

Vindicated by whom? The husband who has moved on, breaking hearts along the way (remember the plenty yawn-worthy curses from one of his exes's OAP sister, Rhecks)?

She waited all these years for the man himself to clear the air. A man flawed from top to bottom to decide her innocence???

This lie that has haunted her for years. If she manages to have an opinion on twitter, she is reminded that she is an adulteress...and she let it be???

I am sorry, but that is wrong.

A woman's vindication is not in the hands of any man.

I exonerate myself. 

I will not wait for any bagga to decide whether I am a whore or a lady *whatever the fuck that even means*

I will not wait ONE minute for anybody to define who I am.

The minute that shit hits the fan, I am writing my own story. Not because I need people on my side...but because I will not allow the universe pick up a lie about me and sit on it.

I will clear the air for my own pleasure. My own peace of mind.

You can't let a man ruin you whilst he goes on having babies everywhere and living his own life. And then when he is fed fat with your crushed reputation, he farts out his opinion hundred years later.

Kai! 

Till this minute, interviews still require she addresses that issue- whether she cheated or not.

Is that a way to live?

So, if women are stoned to death for adultery, 9ice would be sitting on Toni's grave many years later to tell the truth?

We give this gender too much power mehn!

I had mentioned a woman in her sixties who was made to walk round the village naked after she was arraigned in the court-of-retarded-village-elders for adultery.

Her husband had left her and ran into the hands of another woman...

After 10 years she decided to be with another man. The minute that information went round, the husband (who had then been kicked out by his second wife), decided to make a fuss...

And this woman let him win. He demanded that in their CULTURE a woman must wait for her man, as long as she still bears his name...and the consequences for sleeping with someone else (after 10 years of waiting oh!) is to walk around the village...

Butt Naked!

And the woman did it! 

She actually carried her cellulite butt and droopy breasts and walked the entire stretch of the village, whilst children and fellow women mocked her.

Lmao! I can't deal with this kind of madness.

This is a woman with adults as children!!!

We are waiting for men to exonerate us???

To decide whether we are worthy or not? 

Mba. I will not carry that thing around my neck...

Nor will my children.

If you are guilty of whatever-you-are-guilty-of, exonerate yourself by yourself. 

If you are not guilty, exonerate yourself by yourself. 

Your vindication rests with you.
