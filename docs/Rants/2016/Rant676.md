If you meet with one of the members of this church that locked up a 9 year old boy with chains and deprived him of everything...

S/he will tell you:

"Our church is not diabolical. Our pastor means well and has set up many ways we can help one another and prosper.
I don't know about this boy's story. But I know that our church is not an evil church and there is so many good that comes out of our fellowship.
Of course it is not a perfect place. Nowhere is perfect. There are some issues here and there and small challenges to conquer. Not all members are submissive and obedient. But that does not mean it is a bad place to be."

I. Don't. Know. About. This. Boy's. Story.

It is always the response of the gullible brain-dead religious follower.

They don't know. They don't care. They just want their own miracle. And build their own support system. And find the "good" in the midst of nonsense. 

Check yourself. It is exactly the way you sound when you speak or defend your own "religion".

People allowed this to happen. Nobody stopped it. 

Unless he was kidnapped, then his parents may be members of the church and endorsed this barbaric act.

Yet Nigerians are still waiting for an explanation to religion. An explanation to why it is important to fellowship. 

The our-religion-is-not-like-this mantra idlers. 

Nobody cares about your religion. The question is simple: Why is a child locked up in a church like a goat?

Why for heaven's sake is this happening in 2016?

We are "trying to" understand why it is important for the Malawian government to go easy on a culture that spreads HIV amongst young women. Africans want to debate on moving with civilization..We insist that those who seek new methods and new thinking are mad...that they trivialise the importance of age long practices. 

Even when a new disease is in town, religion and tradition do not bulge. They are not structured to move with the times.

They are meant for dead dogs.

Even when the new makeup of the world is asking for more people to be independent of taditional mores...

As we brand society mavericks as mad and mentally unstable...

When atheists tell you your god is sick, you say it is blasphemy.

But if you say a child should be locked up this way under any religious reason...then doesn't that justify how sick you and your god and your religion are?

That your religion helps you find "support" doesn't make it any less useless as a plate of leftover food that should be trashed.

We are not moving any step further if we do not tackle religion.
