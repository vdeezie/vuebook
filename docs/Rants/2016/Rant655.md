All a Nigerian woman needs to do is open her mouth and speak on gender equality, and everything falls apart.

The transition from human to dead leaf takes two seconds.

I cannot trust any Nigerian woman to speak on gender equality if there's a man waiting for her at home.

I cannot. 

She would choose a dick over the thirteen year old girl forced into a marriage in the North.

She would choose dicky-dicky over a woman trying to get her full wages and respect in a company that pushes patriarchal values.

And that is ok. You must understand that your desires to be unequal are valid...

Just as valid as our demands for equality.

But please stop talking about equality. It's not the best side of your intellect. 

By all means keep your men, I plan to keep mine (if I cross that bridge)...

But stay away from having opinions about gender equality if your empathy is as long as your thumb and stops at reaching out to your friend(s) across the table who's been beaten purple by a husband.

That is not a fight for equality. 

That is a woman who chooses to stay with an abuser.  

Stop having opinions. 

You do not have the chutzpah to carry it.

Stuff a royal or raggedy dick in your mouth, whichever brand is waiting for you at home, and shut up.

PS: Any media outlet that asks a woman in a polygamous and/or traditional marriage on her views on gender equality is just being mischievous. 

It is why I will not even bother addressing this with any kind of depth.

The world is moving at great speed. Women are at the centre of progress in China, America, Europe...

But in Nigeria, we are star struck by a king's ability to marry a second wife.

PSS: Remind me again, how do traditional rulers contribute to society that we have to listen to their wives speak? 

One minute your status is elevated and you now stand beside an Oba and it qualifies you to have opinions about equality?

Were you not just a minute ago taking selfies on Instagram like everyone else, and being accused of "stealing" another woman's man? Or do those Dear-Agony-Aunt Q&A discriminate based on a man's social standing?

A poor man is not allowed to cheat or marry a second wife, but a rich man can and will not be judged...instead be paraded as the hottest thing to hold a staff. 

I'm tired.

I cannot vouch for any Nigerian woman to make any kind of sense as regards equality. 

It's tough being one of you. It's really tough.

You'll never find a group more confused in the entire world as Nigerian women. 

Except, of course, their cousins- the African American women.

PSSS: it is why I cannot yet give internet to my kids. Imagine an 11 and 9 year old listening to these things...

"Men and women can never be equal..."

And to try at balancing a feather from a hen's butt with plutonium, she adds...

"We have our different roles."

Waka!
