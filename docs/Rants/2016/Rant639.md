Teebillz blames everyone for his "failure" except himself.

He blames his wife (he helped her, now she won't help him)

He blames his mother-in-law (she is a witch having his destiny for lunch)

He blames his father. That is, by far, the most ridiculous. He blames daddy for having four wives because, well, his actions influenced him to have children with many women too.

He wants to commit suicide. He announces it on social media, tells the driver he hit on the bridge that he is on his way to committing suicide. 

He refuses to take responsibility. 

His life is falling apart because...

Wifey is a "whore". Mother-in-law is a witch. Daddy a polygamous man.

Sigh. 

I was told I took a man's luck once. In marriage. 

My mother was attacked in marriage. 

And of course, the minute you pick your bags to leave a man or dare to succeed despite him, you'z a whore. 

It is so easy to shame a woman.

It is why I ascribe to women losing their shame. That shit will continue to pull you back. 

You are shamed for being successful. 

Shamed for daring to choose a career above many other things. 

Shamed for not wanting to make dinner everyday. 

Shamed for even the crimes not committed because society will empathise with a man who comes out to cry...

"I just want my wife back."

Your wife gets to choose who she wants to be, not you. 

Sometimes when a Nigerian man talks about wanting his wife back, he is talking about pots of soup, and her days of insecurity.

Days she needed him more than she needed air.

Because we bring up the boy child to believe he needs to fix everything- from fixing the plumbing, to fixing the woman...

When a woman rises above his tools, he is offended. He, by himself, begins to feel irrelevant and useless. Nobody drives him to those conclusions, he gets there by himself...

Because for a man, insecurity is a turn on.

You lose it, you lose your vulnerability.

Vulnerability makes men horny. 

It is male privileges. It is patriarchy...

Else, Annie Idibia should be screaming too for being left behind, since she does very little with her life apart from being Tuface's wife. 

If depression is the case here, then let him get help.

Pulling so many families and homes down this path is juvenile and manipulative. 

I find him to be a tawdry manipulator. 

There is reason to believe he is an abuser too. 

There is reason to believe Tiwa Savage has had enough and is being encouraged by family, especially her mother, to get out of it.

It is easy to shame a woman. Her shame is brilliant distraction. 

You slap a woman. And before the world questions you, you claim she sleeps around. 

Brilliant distraction. 

He is a very selfish man. Let doctors find a suitable medical term for this selfishness.

Depression will suffice. 

By God, he is selfish.

It is not that he failed. It is not that any mother-in-law has his "luck" tied to a tree...

The issue may be that he wants to succeed on a level that is as impressive as his wife's.

-Because male privileges. 

But she is the celebrity. 

Isn't this where we need to remind Nigerians that this is 2016 and Gender Equality can save your ass?

Do you know Halle Berry pays alimony to her Ex?

Does it make him less of a man?

Build the boy child to learn the tricks of life- from boardroom to kitchen... you will not hear!

We are giving room for adult male to sulk about not being fed like he is some kid.

This is what society gets- women who can move effectively from career to catering to domestic needs.

Your men are left behind. Still waiting to be fed like babies. 

"She hasn't fed me in 3 years."

Enter the kitchen. It's your own lunch, your dinner.  

I feel so sorry for Tiwa. Just because she is not on social media ranting doesn't mean she isn't hurting badly.

Let Teebillz meet with a doctor. 

And let Tiwa succeed.

Nobody ever shamed a man for loving his job a little more than he does sitting at home with his wife. 

What we do is question the wife...

"Have you made the home unbearable for your husband?"

Patriarchy has to go.
