Do you know that if I stop working for one month, I'd be poor?

Nigeria ensures you are always at the plantation.

No matter how hard you work and how many hours you put on the field...there are only a few people who can boast of wealth longer than a few weeks away from the cotton field.

Is that life?

Do you know that you do not have to be exceptional to succeed in developed societies?

Because "exceptional" is not something everyone should have...

But bread and butter is something you are entitled to as a citizen of a country who wakes up everyday to a job where you, at the least, arrange files.

When we continue to tell Nigerian youth that they have to be exceptional...and they have to work harder and harder and harder like donkeys.

That is not motivation.

It's like telling someone with dyslexia that if he reads harder and harder, he will eventually be able to comprehend texts.

Exceptional is genius.

Not everybody is born genius.

Your averageness shouldn't affect your basic human dignity and the ability to buy a meal.

You are entitled to be average. It might irk people who like to work extra hard... but there's no crime to averageness. 

Average in societies that matter is a rented apartment, money for food and leisure and a decent bank account.

In Nigeria, average is poverty. A state to be mocked and talked down on.

It shouldn't be this way.

We should stop telling Nigerian youth to be super humans.

If you have to, then provide the amenities.

It is only a wicked father who denies his children education then turns around to mock them for not becoming Presidents.

By all means push the youth...but don't push them to a point where all they have to do is believe in a Miracle. 

We may also want to think about how we push them to the brink of suicide with all these damn lies about how great they can be in a nation that has nothing.

Plant doesn't grown on concrete. 

When it does...that's genius. And it will cover TIME magazine. 

These are exceptions.

Policies aren't planned around the "exceptions"...

A nation makes policies for the average citizen with basic needs, skills and dreams. To ensure he lives fulfilled.

The story of Chris Gardner (The Pursuit of Happyness) is a story of a man who finally got a job.

Period.

It was an inspiring story of a man who was finally able to rent an apartment and feed his child.

It is not a story of a billionaire. 

He finally nailed his "average"... and that was enough.

We are going to have more young people failing woefully in business and being utterly dissatisfied with careers if we continue to tell them they will succeed in the face of darkness and abject lack.

How practical is that?

They need to be very aware of what is holding them back. No sugar coating.

Our fathers failed us. They should stop talking and blaming YOU for your inability to work out your salvation.

We have not allowed our youth the opportunity to be bitter.

Rape victims have a right to be angry and upset.

Do not deny them that. 

No matter how many times you tell them to "move on and be great"...

It never works that way.

They need to know what this vile act has done to their minds and bodies...before they can decide to go for therapy and change their lives.

Think about that.
