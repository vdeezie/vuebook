The walls were closing in. 

The heat. Unbearable heat. 

I was losing my patience and my mind.

The familiar smell. The generator fumes. 

So I packed a bag. Locked the apartment...

Booked in at a hotel. Touched the bed and slept for 8 hours straight.

I made winter of my situation.

Woke up. Ordered a meal. Slept again.

Waking and sleeping. Waking and sleeping.

Morning. Front desk called to know if I would leave by noon.

I want to leave. But I can't. 

The familiar smell is waiting for me. Generator fumes. Heat. 

Responsibilities.

I will leave by noon, I said.

But noon has come and gone, and I am here for another night.

They will bring their POS to my room. Oya pay for another night of comfort- basic comfort your country cannot give you. 

I am sleeping and waking. Sleeping and waking. 

Mute television. Watching African Voices on CNN.

I don't want to know what Yvonne Nelson is saying. Rita Dominic comes on; she looks really nice. 

I am upset at the number of Nigerian commercials CNN carries. All this money they give to a foreign news station...

Yet we don't have electricity.

I am thinking of going to watch a movie. But I am drifting in and out of sleep. And cold. And thinking of the heat. And a new week. And my children's lunches for school in the new week. And office deadlines. New projects.

But I am in a hotel room drifting in and out of sleep; trying to see how much cold I can carry out of here tomorrow. 

Because I cannot continue to hide here.

I have to go back into the world and heat and traffic and make back the money I burned for two nights in a hotel room where all I did was sleep and wake and sleep and wake and sleep and wake. And think and eat. And think and sleep.

And sleep.
