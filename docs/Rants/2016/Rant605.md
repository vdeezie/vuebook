For me oh...it is not that a critic writes beautiful sentences.

The most important ingredient is grit- you can call it valour or nerve, to write what needs to be written without considering fellowship, or give any thought to association. 

We don't have people like that. 

Revel in their cute sentences now. One beer or suya with Olamide (or whoever) later...or one lousy red carpet invitation from an actress, and they will sell-out faster than a politician. 

That is why Ayeni of (defunct?) Encomium occupies a very important space in the music industry. 

Wine tonight, serious bashing for releasing that terrible movie - ok not movie - music to the public the next morning.

These celebrities couldn't understand him. They loved him and hated him with the same breath of air.

For his sake they did a little more. Paid attention to details.

His pen was caustic. His column, Soliloquy in Encomium controlled an entire music industry every Tuesday.

It is why I hate social media. We have watered down the genius of art and the critic.

Everyone is now looking for a bit of celebrity and favour. They need to preserve relationships just in case someone-somewhere would need someone-somewhere to escort them to Dubai or invite them for a drink at Quilox.

I talked about Osagie yesterday. And I remember he learned under Ayeni.

He passed on his spine to the younger writer. See how he flies solo.

And then there is Wilfred, I think.

The rest are romancing the people they should be critiquing.

So when you shine your 32 to the celebrity, how are you going to come out and write a review we can respect?

How can you say one person is raising the bar and at the same time the movie did not match your expectation?

What kind of weed are you smoking?

When you are friends with half the cast how can you write with sense?

The critic has to come with audacity and balls.

It's easy to write your truth when you don't know or care or like the person...

But when you do, that is when your so-called review should mean anything to your reader.

Or you could spare us the torture of not reviewing that particular movie/album if your bias is going to be a heavy shoulder pad on your shoulder.

PS: This is why I don't like Sundays. Too much time on my hands.
