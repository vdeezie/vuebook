At #TheConversation I had in Lagos- Oriental Hotel, one of my speakers- Timilehin Oyebode, addressed years of sexual abuse and rape...and lesbianism. 

And in many ways, she presented lesbianism as a consequence of gender child abuse.

She thinks of it as unnatural. Almost evil.

Of course I don't agree with this. 

Did I correct her? No. Why should I? I don't sit on the heads of my speakers to make them "conform".

It is left for the audience to confront her on that logic and flog a new understanding that she might want to process.

But they didn't. Instead two ladies left the building.

AND IT WAS OK!

(Even though there was a Happenings magazine, on every table, with a proudly gay Kenny on the cover edited by me and proudly supported by me).

Did I come to social media to question why they left? No. 

Did they not have a right to interpret Timilehin's speech as they wanted? Yes.

In the last quarter of 2015, I spoke in many secondary schools. I don't patronize parents or teachers when I speak to students. I tell it as I believe it should be told- we can treat our students/children better.

This causes great discomfort to the teachers and administrative executives.

At one school some teachers walked out- after I stated that children should never be called "stupid" in school. Only a lazy teacher qualifies a child as stupid because the child cannot fit into a suffocating stereotype designed by a school's curricular. 

Did I question why they left? Did I lose sleep? Toh. 

My point is: Not everyone will agree with your approach. Why do you think you need to question their decisions? What we should try to do is deliberately connect with people who align with our purpose.

Leaving 99 sheep to go in search of one missing sheep will only work for Jesus.

Mere mortals like us will stick to the 99 birds who align with us and let that fucking lost animal with ojukokoro find for itself what is it is looking for inside the big wild world.

You can't make "understanding people" your life mission. You are going to be 'stinkingly' broke and frustrated, never truly progressing, taking up that responsibility.

Unless, of course, you are a shrink. Then you'd be paid for it.

The questions: Why did they not come to my party? Why did they not support my swimsuit wear? What is wrong with people, why did they block or unfollow me...

Are questions for the gods. 

Why do you want to know?

So you can trim your life and purpose to fit their needs?

Pityparty invites?

Fail.
