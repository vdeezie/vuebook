I can hear, outside my window, a neighbour negotiating with a waste collector.

The manual worker grumbled and said, “but na so dem they pay me.”

“You know where dem dey make their money from?” the neighbour responded.

The negotiating fee is N30.

I am shaking my head in my bathroom.

This is why we need to move out of certain areas. The common thought-pattern is disgraceful and toxic.

You do not know "where dem dey make their money from" because you are a lazy slob who has never worked her entirely life.

Refusing to argue with a waste collector over an extra N30 does not make the other person rich…it makes you stupid to think your “neighbour” needs to have some kind of wealth to let go of that kind of money.

And to trigger that kind of conversation shows your guilt and insecurities of being clueless with your own life.

I long decided not to negotiate with artisans and traders who make profit of N50 or N100 on their goods. I will not do it. And if people have not traded their common sense for a derica of yam flour and made covenant with poverty, they too will understand why it makes no sense at a certain phase in life to badger a street trader to sell plantain chips for N80, when you are well aware the going price is N100!

If he dupes you at all, he would be duping you of N20!

If a corn seller “cheats” you, it would be a little more than N50!

People fight conductors because of N10 and get their shirts torn.

Think about it. 

If you are here on Facebook, that shows you have access to the internet…you have data... Stop fighting traders for a difference of N10!

Many people from the mainland, especially boys in Festac, need to go look for jobs as security guards in Lekki and Ikoyi. I don’t care the degree you have…go and guard a rich man’s gate and see how human beings are expected to live.

Wave to their spoiled children when they hit your thigh and tell you your shirt is smelly. Carry their wives' bags and hear them make those bad tempered calls to their tailors.

Don’t stand near my window with your wife arguing with ‘aboki’ for N30!

We have peculiar family practices in certain areas where grown-ass men marry wives into their father’s tiny apartments, give birth to children and live right there with their parents/in-laws with barely enough space to fart in peace…

Then these ones give themselves the day job of criticizing the honest hustle of their neighbours who make a mockery of all that “communal living” by owning a space just like their father’s, and being the sole occupant.

“You know how dem dey make money?”

There is your solace. Your privilege. Your poverty is legitimate, and your neighbour’s “wealth” is illicit.

When I pointed at a rich man’s crib in Ikoyi and said, “This house is so beautiful! I want to hear the man’s story so badly, I wouldn’t mind paying to listen!”

My partner, at the time, sniggered…

“All this your money-money talk that always excites you… Do you know how these rich people make money?"

it's not the naira notes, its the virtues and habits of the "rich" that excite me.

That was many years ago. That relationship ended that day.

I will not share my body, mind, heart and time with someone who thinks/talks like that.

Daz all.
