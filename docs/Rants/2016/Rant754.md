Today, I am proud. I did something admirable. I think.

Let me tell you:

In Lagos, people hoard their contacts. It is like a treasure trove that nobody gets to see or have access to.
It is unsurprising because there are too many leeches in this town. Too many desperate people with very little to offer but a lot of "presence" that suffocates. Scroungers and frauds.

So yes, people hoard contacts. They hold very dearly the important associations they've built over a short/long period of time... and they hardly give it out. 

There is nothing wrong with that, by the way.

So here I am with an amazing client. She is simply wonderful. The kind of association you want to buff every morning to ensure it stays squeaky clean.

She reaches out to me. She wants me to manage a project. The project requires some kind of artistry in a given field.

I don't have that artistry. But she believes in me and pays quite a sum for me to carry on with the project. 

But when we hold meetings or conversations, there are gaps between us. My knowledge as far as her passion is concerned is sparse.

But she is kind and understanding and encourages me to carry on with the project. 

But I am with guilt. Even though she knows it is not my field, she will have me do this. And signs a cheque for it.

Project managing can be achieved with a deadpan approach to details; yes. You can't pour yourself and your passion into every event.

As a matter of fact, you do not necessarily have to like the theme of the event you put together. Professionally, work can be done without soaking your heart into it.

Even without real passion, a good manager with eye for details and organisational skills can get anything done.

But I made an exception this time, she is such a wonderful woman... she deserves to work with someone just as passionate as she is. And with the right knowledge.

So I took the time to search for her kind.

Today I introduced her to someone else. Someone who has spent her entire life running the same ambition, and is just as passionate about this field as my client.

Oh my! You needed to have seen them together.  The connection. The conversation. Their laughter. Bless!

I felt so happy. It's like matchmaking two people who deserve to be in each other's lives.

I became the outsider too quickly. But it was OK. I was glad. And very proud.

I whispered to the "new girl": Get her number; work with her. She is an amazing person. You should put up a nice project plan for her in 2017.

They exchanged numbers. Added each other on WhatsApp. 

What that means is that I may not get the next project to manage. And that's money off the table.

But this lady I got deserves it more than I do.

It was the right thing to do.

I am glad I did. 

The universe will align situations in some ways to favour me too.

Or maybe not.

It wouldn't matter.

Their smile together was priceless. 

Bless.
