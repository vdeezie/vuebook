I tell my kids to fight, I won't lie.

One day after school, Jolade asked if I could give her money to go buy a new pen at the bookstore.

I gave her a new pen that morning. 

"What happened to your new pen?"

"My classmate took it."

"Who?"

"One girl."

Smoke was coming out from my nose.

"Jolade, get down from my car and go get your biro from that girl. Now."

She was shocked. Mummy was supposed to hug her and tell her everything will be ok...and give her money to buy a new pen.

Issokay.

She alighted quietly and walked back into the school. 

I waited patiently with her sister in the car, at the gate.

15 minutes later, she came out with her pen.

"How did you get it back?"

"I told her to give it back to me or we will fight today. So she hissed and gave it back."

The girl never took her pen again.

The. Girl. Never. Took. Her. Pen. Again.

Period.

You don't leave today's war for tomorrow.

If they are foolish enough to light a matchstick... then pour petrol. 

The most beautiful thing happens after war...

There is calm.

That calm that says: after all your bra eating, herd mentality, genitalia rousing cum disguised as anger...

One important message was passed...

I will not be messed with. 

I will make you cry and beg for help from friends, colleagues, acquaintances, even onlookers...

You will lose your ice and your cool. And I will love watching it happen!

You will ask for God to punish me...that disaster will befall me...that I lose my toe...

But nothing will happen. 

You will have to live with the very painful fact that it only gets better. My skin will glow better. My alopecia cuter. My life sweeter.

That's how it works.

Next time you will learn not to project your challenges and unhappiness on others.

I do not trust peace that comes at no cost. 

I can't trust anything that comes for free... except salvation. 

(Even dat wan sef, pastors have been packaging it at a cost).

You want trouble? Come. 

You will learn.

There is always peace until it is tested. Then there is war...

After war, comes total tranquility. 

Until the next war, which is never too far away.

Soon there'll be nothing left to fight. You'd have confronted all your adversaries (or just silly spineless idiots).

There'll be nothing left to say...because all would have been said by a herd of cattle.

Then god status arrives... like a gold-plated idol, in the shape of a tiger. 

Something like what pagans worship in place of God.
