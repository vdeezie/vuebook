Dear Nigerians, kindly note:

You cannot guesstimate the financial capacity of anyone based on the contents of their Shoprite trolley.

Shoprite is a grocery store. They sell basic domestic/office requirements. Stop trying to review the next shopper's substance or lucre based on a freaking full or empty trolley. 

That look from the trolley to the face of an individual... as if trying to have access to bank statements on the forehead of the individual is typical of a pretend society. 

*
Many broke women wear "original human hair" from as low as N70k to a whopping N250k. Trust me, they are broke. 

*
I know people who are running a life of debt on MAC or Black Up make up products (or any of its fabulous and expensive cousins). They spread the payment of one compact powder, one mascara, one matifier and foundation over a period of three months; paying up debt from an already stiff salary. Looking beautiful never felt so broke. And stupid. 

*
If you are still judging people based on the phones they use... you need to shoot yourself in the head. 

Almost all the upper middle class men I know have broken Samsung screens. They just can't be bothered...as long as they can reach the bank manager handling their account, and can read text messages from their investment partners from that broken screen, they really do not see the urgent need to get a new one.

I know of a rich fellow who held his phone together with rubber bands for months!

It's easy to judge the poor. 

"What phone do you use?" Remains their favourite line. 

*
Whatelse?

Fashionistas and lovers of fashion are almost always in debt.  

Only Linda Ikeji, a bored rich wife or a true bourgeois can keep a debt-free life on a designer wardrobe.

*
It is a materialistic world, even the (urban) poor have access to veneer of wealth. 

If at all you must... appraise an individual's financial status by analysing his flourishing business, property with his name on it, and/or investment with returns.

Let people wear nameless shirts... as long as they are judged based on substance of true ambition.
