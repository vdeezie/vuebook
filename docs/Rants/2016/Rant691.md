I cannot bear the sight of my own child as part of a cyber mob. I would have failed on all counts to find the child of my womb chanting like a clueless idiot when everyone else is chanting. 

Drones are the lowliest people in the world. They have very small dreams, zero ambitions... and alot of work unattended to. Because there's no zeal, no determination, no passion. 

They fail everyday they wake up. 

They are winning for breathing air. Winning for stuffing food in their mouths. Winning for taking a shower.

And when it becomes too obvious they are going to rot away at the hem of life after a thousand opinions of others without really achieving anything worth talking about... 

They find a spouse.

If that is unsuccessful, then they find a crowd they can be part of to help amplify a voice that holds no power.

They remain unoriginal. Afraid. Unsure. Unprepared. Moving with the tides. Waiting for a sign...

Be original, child. Be original. 

There's nothing to this life if you will not have your own voice and hold on to your own set of values. 

This brings me to the Linda Ikeji twitter bashing going on...

I stopped reading Linda's blog a while back because, really, I stopped believing in whatever makes her successful.

It's a big joke to me.

But what does it matter? The woman is successful. Period.

But that is not enough for me. Success is supposed to be profound. And since I can't make sense of any of this, I stopped visiting the blog. 

It is why I couldn't honour any of her invitations. 

Because I KNOW I'd still have to condemn some of the things she does.

And I wouldn't be able to hold an original opinion of Linda if I allow myself to dine with her. 

I would have to overlook some very insensitive things that should NEVER  catch her attention...

Like the Nigerian gay saga. When a man cannot marry another man in peace in a country that legally endorses their union without Nigerians calling for their heads... and Linda cannot look the other way knowing that her report of this wedding will cause immense grief to a man who has done nothing to her... is beyond me.

Or when she apologises to Mayowa's family and states how she has helped many people like her... those patronizing terms and self righteous stance. No.

I will continue to keep that distance so I can criticise her when it is needed.

Nonetheless I think Linda is an amazing individual... and she operates her empire from her own wealth of knowledge, which might not be very deep... but I doubt she does anything out of spite.

She sincerely doesn't know. Or can't express her true intentions well. 

Ignorance is not an excuse... but she isn't any different from 99% of Nigerians... so what's the fuss about?

Because she is rich?

I can never understand how Nigerians can say that Linda killed Mayowa.

A woman who had leukemia and cancer that had spread to her vital organs. 

You saw the pictures. Yet, you believed in a miracle. That miracle didn't happen. Move on.

Steve Jobs is a rich and influential American in a first world country that has science as its hope... yet he didn't survive cancer.

Dora Akunyili was an influential Nigerian... she didn't survive cancer. 

We KNOW that cancer remains one of the deadliest ailments of our time...

But our religion doesn't allow us to focus on these facts. 

I am happy Mayowa lived to see the kindness of Nigerians. Apart from the latter drama... she was loved by Nigerians.

But isn't it a tad bit preposterous to think she would survive that stage of cancer? Especially when she is stuck at home and all the activities of trying to fly her here or there.

To blame Linda for her death is just ridiculous.

It would have been kind if Linda got a reporter first on the case... she could have used a different headline...she could have done this and she could have done that.

But she didn't. So what? How does that make her a killer of sort?

Linda is not refined in her methods. Why we want to make her Michelle Obama or Oprah in her delivery is crazy.

You know her limits. Yet you are riled up everytime she writes what every other blogger writes. 

Except other bloggers are poor. And Linda is rich.

And her riches gets on your nerves. But it is not your money.

She is not the Nigerian government eating your tax money. 

Instead of bashing someone who just moved her business into a N35million mansion... why don't you attack a government that still cannot provide quality healthcare for its people?

Priorities. Common sense.

Stuff that mobs don't have.

Too many average people seeking relevance in the noise. 

After the noise... you will still be average. 

Pffff.
