Women should learn to appreciate the importance of acquaintanceship.

Not everytime hustle for friendship.

You are most likely to enjoy a fulfilling, healthy, rewarding relationship with another woman as an acquaintance. 

Friendship is stifling, intrusive, demanding, patronising.

What is this ridiculous need to be called a friend to the next woman all the time?

You meet someone on Facebook. You like their posts. The next minute you stretch out an invitation for drinks at your place. 

Come and play with my children. Come and watch a movie. Come and have some food.

Did they tell you they are hungry?

What if they don't like children? Then they would have to pretend they can stand your kid's wails.

What if they don't like alcohol?

What if they think that dress looks horrible on you? What if they think you look like a whale?

What if they think you'z ugly? Or sad? Or struggling with self issues?

But you've stamped their passport with friendship too soon, they are always going to patronize you for the entire time you continue fooling yourselves that this stifling position is cool.

Women cannot function without some thick crust of friendship slapped on another woman's buttocks. 

What are you so afraid of that you need to hang some tag on your shoulder like a dress for sale to keep you happy?

Why do women think we care about the next face that will appear (with them) in a group selfie flashing horrendous makeup?

We are thinking of the next technology that will change the future, damn it.

With acquaintances, you get better results and it is alot healthier to maintain, and more rewarding. 

With acquaintances there's nothing to gossip about, there are no personal boundaries to offend. People come together to achieve goals and can retrieve to their personal space to preserve some dignity. 

Many women need to take every single person back to acquaintances...and build on friendship slooooowly.

I will tell you this for free: Your lack-of-everything is hinged on the burden of friendship you carry. 

Women with too many friends, in too many secret groups, trying to nurture too many personal relationships...

Achieve very little.

Argue with your reflection from a broken plate.
