I was at the market this morning... because semovita with afang soup is "hungry-ing" me to cook.

A voice from a loudspeaker on top of a small wreck of a car, with stickers of white women looking sexually satisfied plastered on the windshield, announced:

"You know why goat nor dey get malaria? Goat nor dey sick unless you poison am. Because goat dey chop leaf. Live well like goat. No let shame catch you. Buy your staphylococcus medicine. If water dey commot for your breast... if you get craw-craw for nyash... if you dey get discharge.... make shame nor catch you, come make I give you medicine."

It seems like a regular event because people and life just carried on. Nobody paid any attention.

I was the only one cracking up.

Yes I see the Staph jalopy everywhere... but that goat analysis had me in stitches. 

PS: A regular bottle of palm oil is now N700. When I told the woman I bought it N350 the last time I came to the market...

She looked at me and asked, "e be like say you commot Nigeria since 2015. Where you dey live since; space dey for my pikin?"

Shade of life! 

The best of sarcasm is tied around the waist of market women.
