I know what Nigerian kindness looks like...

It is alot of talk. Alot of big grammar. Literature. Telling people what you plan to do if you had money. A bunch of cyber huggers telling you that you are sweet and "so kind" even if you haven't exactly changed a life with your income.

Nigerian kindness will cheer you on and leave you halfway when it is time to bring out a cheque book.

Nigerian kindess is always trying to help.

"Trying to" being the operative word.

It never comes to fruition. Ever.

Nigerian kindess is stagnant. Smelly. 

Nigerian kindess criticises what it cannot comprehend.

Nigerian kindness never has enough. It is eternally waiting for a million naira to land in its account before it can rise to any financial obligation. 

Nigerian kindness gives the impression that it is busy trying to be part of a project or activity. It never really makes it. It is laughable.

Nigerian kindness is a fraud.

Nigerian compassion will leave you in a strange land or mental place to figure out your issues. Then when you arrive from your personal hell, it will write a cute post for you.

Nigerian kindness is full of mocking laughter.

Nigerian kindness always looks for the easy way. A post is interpreted as a kind act. 

Fuck you and your post. Bring out your damn money. Rise to ONE occasion. Nobody is going to eat your kind intelligent post for lunch.

Help one person in need. Don't direct us to the person. YOU, help. Leave your data and go and help someone, follow a cause, contribute to a project. 

Or be quiet.

This world is defined by people who act.

I left talkers in 2015. 

There was never a time that I gave that I had up to a million naira in my account.

I was always one hundred thousand naira short of everything. Yet I sponsored The Conversation (except Abuja) from my pocket.

I couldn't wait for sponsors. We need new knowledge and we need it NOW. That's how I see it.

The Ikotun rape case is being financially handled by Evans and me.

I have been a beneficiary of true kindness from people who do not go about with a halo.

They don't write posts trying to classify kindness. 

They ACT. Period.

Are you people still falling for this shit? Big words and no action?

Aren't you bored?

This is 2016.

You're either writing in the comfort of your home...OR you are spending money to touch lives.

Just because you say you are kind doesn't make you anything close to what it means. 

Your Nigerian kindness, like it's humility, is a fart joke.

I refuse to be defined by your definition of kindness. 

I am UNKIND.

In my unkindness, I have done more than you can allow your penny-pinching ass achieve.

Don't call me humble or kind.

I despise your Nigerian virtues.
