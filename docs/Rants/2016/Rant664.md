Nigerians, you think you have problems?

Our economic woe is a general pain to everyone. Even the bourgeoisie in Lekki and Banana Island are coping with bad roads, flood, providing their own water, security and electricity. 

Nigeria is a deadbeat father who hates all his children. He is a rolling stone, and cares for only himself.

I can deal with that. I really can.

As long as dad hates all of us. Then he is the one with a problem. 

BUT in America, their father is a bastard. 

He chooses whom to love. He loves his white kids. The ones with straight hair and blue eyes.

I doubt if Daddy Nigeria knows how to provide for his children. He has been clueless for more than 50 years! 

But Daddy America knows. He knows...and that is what makes this so painful.

He fucking knows how to love. He knows how to give. He knows what a hug can do for a child. He knows! 

For god sake, he knows!

But he chooses not to show love and empathy towards some of his kids- his Black kids!

There are no home examples for Daddy Nigeria to learn from. He grew up in colonial disaster. And he can't give what he doesn't have.

But God will not forgive Daddy America... for all that he knows but refuses to share equally with his children. 

How do you wakeup everyday in a home that feeds your white and yellow siblings with proper meals...but throws dog food at you- just for the sake of the colour of your skin... yet expects you, somehow, to be great? To figure it out? To win in life despite his constant show of hate to you- his child?

Watch #AltonSterling's video and weep for America. 

Weep for a wicked father. 

This is not fair!

They did not choose to be born in America. YOU raped their mothers in Africa and brought them to your country. 

Why, in heavens' name, can you not treat them as you do your priceless white kids who storm movie theatres to shoot people...who carry guns into churches to kill an entire congregation...who rape victims at dumpsites? 

It is tough to live with a father who knows how to love but chooses to hate you.

Stop America. Stop this blatant and shameful racism.

This is so wrong!

You are godfather to the world. Have you no conscience?

What kind of whore behaviour is this?

Fuck #AllLivesMatter...Nobody is displaying acts of deliberate violence and prejudice towards the Caucasian. That's how all should be treated.

#BlackLivesMatter too damn it!

They matter!
