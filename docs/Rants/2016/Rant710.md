Today, after school, as the students filed out of their classrooms into the arms of parents and guardians...

A teacher with a microphone said:

"You have 30 seconds to get out of the classrooms. One - two - three..."

I can't understand why we have to be rude to children. 

Get out?

Fucker, I just paid a good sum to that school you teach. 

When we count-down for kids to leave their classrooms, they tend to get anxious... they run... hit one another along the corridor because punishment looms...they hurt one another... 

With this ruthless exercise, they learn to disrespect one another because the teachers don't respect them enough. 

And the cycle continues (within these walls misogyny blooms).

I was going to walk straight to where he was standing and dishing out the orders... but I doubt he'd understand.

I wear my stubborn parent tag proudly, by the way. 

"Students, it's time to go home. Please leave the classrooms now."

How about that for a change? Will it kill a Nigerian adult to be polite to kids?

We should be civil to children, whether the parents can afford a private education or the kids are stuck in a dirt poor school with blocks for seats.

Everything about this country is wrong.

Yet nobody questions long enough.
