Island vs. Mainland.

These pseudo-bourgeois are the larger population of Lekki/Victoria Island residents.

You must have a lot of spirit and patience to date an ersatz-bourgeois. That faux lifestyle in the heat of recession can cause rabies.

There's nothing pragmatic about dating a quasi-bourgeois. It's like driving a lamborghini on a N150k salary.

Nothing sensible or reasonable from that side of town.

If you are going to date a bourgeois, then date a proper bourgeois. A working income-earning bourgeois. Save yourself the constant embarrassment of a manager of a club calling your home to settle a $3,000 bill left in your name from a faux-bourgeois partner who drives a range rover yet is unable to fuel it.

Men who ask to borrow N3m from you and are offended you don't have it. As if you were put on this earth to meet their material needs.

Their outlook to life is as narrow as a hole in a needle, and you'd be spending half the time dealing with parochial behaviour...

One ex here. One expensive Dior tie that needs to be paid for there. One vacation to Netherlands that isn't necessary. One Armani suit and nowhere to go. A life of rolex watches and crazy expensive bric-a-bric that can feed the needy.

All on a near-zero income, just a trimmed beard and nice cologne and fine boy status. 

That's all.

Unless you are 21, and it's all about the tinsel lifestyle...

What the hell do you need a man like that for???

Date a working-class genius from the mainland.

Instead of buying a range rover, he splits the money and buys two cars- one for himself and the other for...

Not you, silly: his mother!

Yes. One for his mother. 

But he'll treat you right. Spend right by you. Take you to nice places. Buy you really really really nice things. 

And you will do same because what you have is genuine.

No metrosexual hassles here.

Do you know how qausi-bourgeois freak out when the barber gets their hairline cut wrong?

Jesus!!!

Your whole day is messed up because the side of his beard was wrongly shaven. And he is going to keep nagging about it like a little princess without designer shoes.

Seriously, is that the life you want?

Quilox selling champagne for 10Ã— the price... and your man will go there like a child and buy it for some fake-ass ambience...

When you can buy that piss-tasting liquor for cheap at Shoprite. 

A working-class man thinks of you. He is daily thinking of you and how you complement him.

A faux bourgeois thinks of himself alone and when he'll make it to bellanaija for the gold-studded shoes he wore to another trite party... or to lindaikeji's blog for his customised car emblazoned with his initials. 

Ugh!!!

Date a Lekki boy with a job. A real job. Or don't date from that side of town at all.

If you don't know, let me tell you: those business men with half-a-contract lifestyle every other quarter are starving from their N3.5m rented lekki apartments.

No money. Just big dreams and zero pragmatic approach to achieving anything.

You could just come over to the mainland and date real men who run good legit businesses, make good money without all the frills and peplum to their being.

Or date a brother in Ibadan with a stream of income. 

I'm not kidding!

Date a real man. Leave all these wanna-coulda-shoulda using your clarins lotion, caring so damn much about their appearance. So much that a cat will be drowning in a tub and they'd pay no attention to it until the last speck of white is off their pair of blue jeans. 

Anything but a pretend-bourgeois from the most expensive ghetto in the world.

Anything but that.
