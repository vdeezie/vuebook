One time, I was heading to school. 

Lagos-Ibadan expressway.

The bus broke down, typical of rust and zero maintenance. 

After 10 minutes of staring at the engine, one passenger decided on an interesting solution:

"Let us pray and command the engine to work."

So they prayed. And I watched. 

In my 20s, even whilst I wasn't yet a full blown problem to society, I was yet as skeptical about ordinary things that needed extraordinary solutions. 

After a vigorous 10 minutes prayer, the driver carried his coconut head into the car to see if it would respond to their prayers.

It didn't. Of course.

Another out-of-this-world idea dropped in the crowd:

"How about we call a mechanic?"

A mechanic came.

And the mechanic did the miracle of fixing the problem.

We carried on with our journey. 

Even in the Bible ehn, when God wanted to build a city, He didn't pray it to being...

He called on craftsmen and artisans to build the city. 

What's the point of all our talent and skill, of academic pursuits, of handiwork, of apprenticeship and internship and broad academic texts and debates and researches gathered over many years of sacrifice... If all we need to do is pray to solve basic challenges?

If God cures your headache, how's his other child, a doctor, going to survive?

If we don't need the expertise of the next person, how are we going to build society and grow the economy?

I have heard pastors say, "the 'enemy' will build a house and hand you the keys...'"

The "Enemy" is the hardworking entrepreneur breaking his back, applying all of life's wealth principles...

And the "Beneficiary" of this sermon is usually the members of a church. A group of regular people, living as averagely as lice.

Yet we believe this bullshit. 

We actually believe that a god will take from one to give to the other. Yet he is a god without favourites. Or is he so lacking in "gifts" that he needs to steal or deprive others to meet your delusions?

Many of them are still waiting all across the nation for this type of breakthrough prayer to happen. They are waiting for the keys to their yachts purchased by Jim Ovia's money, and access to the bank account of Dangote. 

They are waiting for the coming-to-pass of the prayer shared in church of "God handing the neighbour's car keys over to you."

Sit there and be waiting for a miracle. 

The ant is yet to pray to God. Yet He uses them to instruct humans:

"Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
"How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep? A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to restâ€” and poverty will come on you like a thief, and scarcity like an armed man." 

Ntor!
