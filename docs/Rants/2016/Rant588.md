My stepmother.

When I was 12, I followed my stepmother everywhere. 

At the salon, I would meet a group of women with rollers on their hair, feet in warm water, fixing nails and tweezing eyebrows...

These women talked about their husbands (in the 90s it seemed every woman was married). They wore ugly faces and spat bitter words. It was an endless exhausting exercise even for me unfortunate to listen. 

In that tight group of, sometimes, women who have never met one another, was a silent code.

Whatever that code was, I still don't know. But there was an understanding amongst these hurting women. 

And though the ambience was sad and toxic...it "healed" these women. 

But the healing needed another dose of healing too soon after that. They picked it up the next Sunday, right where they left off...and there seemed to be no end to their pain and complaint.

As a child I wondered what kind of life that was.

At the market, my stepmother would gather once again with women she barely knew and the man-talk would continue. Teeth-gnashing bitterness and sadness it made my tummy hurt.

It was hard for me as a child to reconcile these female experiences with the men they talked about.

My father, like most of his friends, were the opposite of the women who gathered. The men were jolly, drunk, loud and they talked about their women in glowing terms, and giggled when they talked about other women they desired (polygamy didn't wear a hypocritical face in the 90s).

As a 12 year old, I found the crowd of men more intriguing and healthy.

When women visited my mother, they complained about their husbands.

When men visited my father, they wept over bad debt.

I am now an adult. A mother of two. And this script hasn't changed.

Technology has taken it away from markets and salons to social media. 

Did I forget to mention how women would gather after church to talk in hush tones about their men? Some of them would crack open and confess to hideous motives.

And I had to stand there and listen. One hand in my stepmother's grip, the other hand holding her bag.

Women always seemed victimised. It was very unhealthy for a child to witness.

The after-salon-banter was always refreshing for them. But the problem with that kind of therapy was the need to be replenished too soon. You keep going back for your doses. 

One story is never enough. And to justify this habit of constantly complaining about men, women try to balance their pain with prayers or pep talk.

They turn the session to some kind of soul-searching soul-lifting exercise when what it truly is...is a deep hole that consumes your strength, your power, your will, your individuality and...

Your common sense.

These methods patronise women's vulnerabilities...to an extent that they can't make simple decisions on things so flippant that you would need to wonder if they are mentally ok.

"My husband slept with my maid. I am so hurt. He says the maid should stay. I don't know what to do."

These type discussions in 2016 are unforgivable, pathetic. 

So much is happening in the world. Life itself is advancing...

Women, we are not evolving. 

It is ok to seek answers, to find solutions to relationship problems and endless men issues...

But it is not ok to make it a career where you need to report every other day to mark your presence and feed your good sense and health with a pile of similar sobs.

Our grandmothers were like that. Our mothers are like that. So are our stepmothers. 

We are like that too. 

I am begging you...do not let our girl child inherit this madness.

Good morning.
