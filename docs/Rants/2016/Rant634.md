This idea that a feminist has to love ALL women...

Support ALL women...

Understand ALL women...

Be patient with ALL women...

Fight for ALL women...

Stand by ALL women...

Is another trick by Patriarchy and its playthings.

People even decide the temperament of a Feminist. 

It would be hilarious if it wasn't annoying.

I am not a political holder, I don't have your oil money in my purse.

I am not your Pastor, I am not preaching any religion. 

I owe you nothing. Definitely not the way I choose to live or how recklessly I choose to speak.

Feminism might seem like an evangelical mission, but for me it is a personal victory. 

I overcame my own pretensions, my own struggles. And I come to Facebook to share my joy. I hold events to hear others share their joys.

And when I am in a position to burn on a stake for a woman WHOSE STORY RESONANTES WITH ME, I will.

I am not trying to reach out to anybody. You must be mistaking me for a priest. 

I am not your saviour. Don't look at me to help you define your methods on Feminism. 

If you have, at some point, placed me above the average woman, bring me down now. I will never meet your expectations. It will never happen.

If my daughters choose an exceptional career over a heartbreak,  I would have fulfilled my work.

Nothing more. 

You are not a child. Stop waiting for a Feminist to give you a reason to believe that the girl child deserves equal opportunities as boys.

I don't have to be "nice" before you admit that women are burdened unfairly under a patriarchal society especially in certain rural settings.

I don't want to be nice. Don't you get it? 

It's not part of the deal here.

Listen to more stable feminists like Ugo Chime and Adunni Adelakun. Let them be enough for you.

Allow me to be the bad egg, the black sheep.

If I wasn't here embracing my bad self, I might as well be dead.

This is how I choose to practice me own freedom.

I am not asking for any followers.

I choose to celebrate the women I want to celebrate, and ignore the rest. 

You will not decide what I should do or become...or how I should behave because I am a feminist. 

Nah. That's not going to happen.

You will not use my own freedom against me.

I am liberated from your opinions. Toss that your box with my name on it on your girlfriend's head. She needs the covering.

If alcohol was my thing, I would get drunk everyday. 

That is how much I want to define my own liberties. 

That people pick me out to represent a movement is something they will soon get over. Maybe they like my dimple- you know, a feminist with a dimple. That too, they will get over. 

This phase will pass. Some young and intelligent lady will fill that spot- someone as superb as Mary Ajayi.

Hopefully she comes with less need to bark.

But I will still be here, living my truth and spitting on your subtle methods of taming a woman who just wants to be bad.

Let my feminism not continue to threaten your peace of mind.

I am never going to change. 

Find "god" for yourself.
