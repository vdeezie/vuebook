Hey god!!!

My people, why nah?

I announced my absence from #HappeningsRadio only because I need to focus on the other arms of the business. 

We have a dating website/business coming up, Happenings TV, we just bought a comedy site where people can upload funny skits...

And I also had to return to writing for the website. It was lacking real content, so I had to step in. Again.

Now because I wasn't present on #HappeningsRadio last week, ratings have dropped 51% according to our analytics...

And Happenings website have increased 60%.

Hian!

I appreciate the increase in Happenings website... I appreciate that you people follow me upandan, but please don't leave #HappeningsRadio nah!

Na me still dey run all of dem. Biko.

Listen to Elsie and Syn and Bimbo and Pamela and Evans and Tori for town and enjoy DJ Limo's non-stop jamz.

Elsie did a great job on TMS last week. She'll be there for the next two months running the show. 

She adds a lot of colour to it. People call in, and there are recharge cards to be won.

There are many giveaways too: cakes for enemies and blenders for friends. So please log on and enjoy!

If it's any consolation, I'll still be LIVE on #NascoMoments every Wednesday. 

Na we we. 

I jus' say make I hail una. I want to get the website to achieve half as much as the radio has in such a short time. So bear with me.

It also shows my struggle as a leader. The fact that I am yet to replicate my kind.

It's not as if I have not tried. I push and push. I motivate. I demand. I guide...

But it seems Nigerian "youths" are not responding to treatment. 

I have loyal staff. At least I can point to 3 amazing people I have thrust into leadership position. But...they are "afraid" to embrace it fully like I would have.

I step into leadership roles without fear. I see that not many people are like that. 

But I love my team. Now how to turn them to brilliant leaders so I can go on vacation and nobody will miss me...is what I want to be able to achieve.

I remember my assistant editor at Happenings website said at the brainstorming session we held last week that... "Ms. Joy you abandoned us."

But I didn't abandon my writers. I had to start #HappeningsRadio. And I wanted them to be bold and crazy enough with ideas on the site so they can run it without my daily intervention... but it didn't work. Sigh.

I feel like a breastfeeding mum sometimes. 

I am still looking for my kind.
