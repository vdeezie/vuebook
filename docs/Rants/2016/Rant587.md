Nothing beats the nonsense I am about to share:

The entire school was denied proper lunch and break time was cut short on Friday because...

A parent came to school, walked down a block of classrooms and decided she wouldn't be enrolling her child.

Why?

Wait for it...

She was soooooo disappointed because the students in the classes she passed by did not stick their heads out of the windows to greet her.

This fool walked through the corridor, she didn't get inside the classrooms, yet she was certain the students lacked respect.

She was angry and stormed out of the school with her bag of cash.

And what did the Head of Admin do?

Yup. She scolded the entire school and cut down their lunch hour.

If a parent walks through the corridor of a school and does not find students fawning over her... Is it right to punish the entire school for the sake of the arrogant glutton?

Are students supposed to leave their classwork to look out the window for roaming parents during school hours so they can greet them?

If a parent meets the eye of a few students, would it be out of place as the older person to open her mouth and greet the children?

So an entire school was punished. And all the adults which would include teachers and Principals stood by and approved of this nonsense. 

Normally I would walk to the school the next day and tell them exactly how stupid I think this is...

But my daughters have pleaded with me once that I have created enough scene in their school to last a lifetime; and they don't want to be picked out for having a troublesome mother.

Whatever! 

I have apologised on behalf of these adults. We continue to fail our children.

With the kind of money we pay for school fees, we deserve to have teachers with NAFDAC approved commonsense!
