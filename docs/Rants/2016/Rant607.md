I am always amused when Nigerians act surprised to learn that a child would want to run away.

I tried to runaway once- to nowhere- because I didn't think my mother loved me and I was tired of her manipulations. Maybe she wasn't, but that was how I felt at the time. I was irritated by our constant disagreements.

At eleven I took a casual walk to nowhere...and I kept saying to myself, "if only there was a place I could run to."

And that was me, as a child, with a fairly great home.

Kids in developed societies where domestic child abuse bear consequences from an active social institution still record staggering number of kids leaving home.

Yesterday I read the story of this young Nigerian boy, beaten like an animal by his father. He is just nine.

This is not an isolated case amongst a certain demography. This is life in its almost normal form.

We are bad parents. The Nigerian parent fail disgracefully at the job of parenting. 

We accuse children of witchcraft and leave them for dead...for white Danish women to rescue them.

And when we are not bold enough to call them witches, we send them on errands one hundred thousand times a day.

We expect that they should be agile enough to be slaves. 

Yet we are surprised.

Because we have perfected the art of pretending that this mediocre setup we call Family in Africa is something of immense pride and joy.

We watch (step) fathers fuck them. And we do nothing.

We gotta save our marriages.

And when we are not looking away from child sexual abuse, we are talking down at our kids. Many young adults have never heard their parents say I love you. 

How do you spend your entire life and never hear I love you from your parents?

You think that is sane?

These parents are sociopaths.

They beat up kids. A man leaves a woman and she pours her frustration on the children he leaves behind.

We call them names.

"E nor go beta for you, evil pikin"

"Aje oshi. Omo buruku"

"Useless child. See your ugly face like your father."

Constantly until they start to look for meaning away from the walls of your home. 

What makes you think kids do not aspire to better living?

And when they do, we think it is strange?

It's the same way people post those cabin biscuit packs and/or rickety trucks made with bottle corks and claim, "if you did not experience this, you missed out."

Delusions. 

Cabin biscuits taste like saw dust. And what's a cork truck when a kid can have turbo-charged speed car off the shelf of a toy shop?

Denial is our way of handling the many ways Nigerian parenting fall below basic achievements.

13 year olds elope. It's an adventurous age.

You may want to be your daughter's friend, dear Nigerian parent.

You may want to practice this parenting job differently from how you've been taught.

-Because all our Nigerian noise is just empty noise.

13 year olds elope. Even Americans know this- the society with streets of gold when viewed from the top of an African tree.
