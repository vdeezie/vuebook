I went to Afropolitan Vibes yesterday for the first time because the show finally comes with a fee to justify all the hardwork.

N1,500 gate fee. I took three of my friends along.

I am not some bourgeoisie who likes to spend...

I'm a struggling middle class Nigerian always jittery about money. And dignity. 

Or maybe I'm just a misanthrope and the thought of a lesser crowd and zero body fluid exchange appealed to me more than lounging in my apartment, watching Nina Simone's biopic.

But there's a principle to the Afropolitan Vibes experience. And it is one that I hold dearly in my personal dealings and choices. 

Free numbers are like the wind. They are not yours. At the end of the value chain, they really do not count or matter. 

If at all you will gather the numbers, then be sure to use them as stepping stone for your PR or marketing deals. 

Free numbers are not loyal to you. They don't care about you. They care about themselves. What they want. What they can get from you. How you make them feel.

Free numbers care only about how you make them feel. 

The minute you fix a stiff price. It wouldn't matter how much they praised you or cheered you, they'll fight you for daring to step up a ladder. Criticise you for dreaming bigger.

Free numbers don't care about cost of production or the hours of training. Free numbers don't care.

Their screams of support end when you dare to put a value mark on your brand.

So the show moved from N500 to N1,500

And people who feel entitled are complaining. 

They are not there when you need to negotiate Mike Okri to come on stage after two decades. 

They just want you to get the artists every other Friday and entertain them.

Whether the N500 covers the expenses or not, just give us a good show and let us shake thick thighs.

Free numbers don't count. Free numbers will never count. Use it to your advantage if at all.

Seek for real value.

If you define what value means to you, the people who matter will stand with you.

What is the point having 1000 friends if you can't find N30k bail money when the hour of need arrives? (forget for a minute that bail should be free Lol!)

What's the point hanging out every weekend with a crew if you can't get sound advice when you need one?

As Prisca would say, "nor be dis one wey you give work don dey roll nyash for your front like say e fit compete with you for relevance? See life oh!"

Free numbers.

We can't run away from leeches...

But be wise to know when it must stop. 

Me, I am happy for Afropolitan Vibes. 

This country is too tough for anyone to tell you what to do with your platform. 

Better 1000 premium paying clients than one million sweating faces.
