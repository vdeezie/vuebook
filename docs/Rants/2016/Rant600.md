At Open Day today...

My daughter's teacher said:

"You don't need to worry. Ife is number one in my class. But can you teach her how to work in a team. How to accomdate followers as a leader? She rides solo..."

Then she added:

"She is an outlier. A one woman conqueror. Can you teach her how to carry people along?"

"Ok."

*Hehehehe. Like mother like daughter, ehn?*

"Another thing", she said, "Your daughter is a Diva. A fly can't perch on her nose. Can we trim her wings?"

Kikikikiki. I don't know where she got that one from oh.

Then I moved to Jolade's class.

Her teacher is male. 

And he wants to know how I am coping as a single-beautiful-mother.
