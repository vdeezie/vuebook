If you are young, try to separate your career from your loyalty to friends.

I cannot say this enough. 

Your desire to be received as a close-minded average-in-all-you-do best pal amongst people who eat peppered goat meat at arty places is valid...

But you have a career. And unless God is throwing manna from heaven to feed you...then your career must be priority. 

Career above almost everything else.

You don't know where next you'll be working. People are watching. 

And your bias sucks. 

For me to complain, it shows it has been a pattern...now it crawls on my skin like a rash.

People are watching.

You want to be a tough cookie in the Literary circle. You want to sit around certain people and be known as someone with some kind of intellect. You want to choose Ankara over Vera Wang...

Because you need this sect to authenticate your hustle.

You will die poor. 

You better wake up.

Go and study a fellow like Osagie Alonge. 
Osagie is a true journalist. 

Everybody including his friends will face his harsh criticisms. No useless cowardly sub. Come, agree or disagree. That is his principle.

He will dine with Dbanj tonight and take selfies...the next minute Dbanj is out with another mediocre struggle he calls music, Osagie will sit on him like a virus. 

The critique will be worth its weight in gold.

See how far he has come. The platforms he has risen to give speeches.

(You are here, trying to find a miserable place in Literature).

They read him, all of them- from MI to Don Jazzy.

They may not like him. But they respect him.

Sometimes, even Fear is better than all this irritating chummy shit young people get up to.

You will single-handedly wreck the media you work for if all the good you see are in the people you like OR you want to like.

Enough of that shit. 

Someone didn't get a job recently because of something similar- this type behaviour. 

Little by little see how far you are from the true mark of success.

But I may be wrong. If your ambition is to be counted as one who frolicked with writers and was accepted in an industry as arty, then by all means carry on.

Drop the journalist tag on your way out.
