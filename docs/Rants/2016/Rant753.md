Strong women do not advise other women to be strong or make smart choices.

I am not talking about cyber feminists; I am talking real strong women who have got their finances, emotional wellbeing, career or business, mental state, relationships and social ambitions under lockdown. 

They are always unwilling to instruct other women to be strong in situations that they had, on many occasions, displayed incredible strength and zero fuckery.

Why?

It is the default female makeup to pamper poor choices... and strong women believe that their strength, though a huge part of their success, is not normal or natural. They try to protect it from constant judgments... and the best way to protect what they have is never to display it or share it with others or talk about it.

For fear of being judged or seen as lacking feminine qualities.

Even when you meet her in the heat of making mind-blowing decisions, she quickly wears a smile and attributes that smart thought or action to a god or a spouse who whispered it into her ears one sunny morning.

We all join hands to applaud this her invisible spouse or partner... but we know it is not true.

It's easier and acceptable for a strong woman to wail with a woman in harm's way, than advise her to pick up her life and throw the middle finger to the world.

She is never going to say that. 

She is going to tell a "victim" what a victim wants to hear. With Society present in the girl talk session, the strong woman tells the other woman to bear the pain, pray, think of her children, gather family members for a meeting, ask nicely, cook better, smell better, jog longer hours, apply better makeup...

Anything but blame the predator. 

This is not her reality, but she is "abnormal". So her reality is not exactly a good thing, even though it is her antidote to beauty and success in her life.

She has embraced her strength, but deep down she believes her strength is a strange thing for a woman to have.

The strong woman believes she has some kind of super powers that must be protected from public review. And the only way she can protect her rare gift is to act like it is not really there... and through her constant impuissant advise to other women, she is able to fit into society. Find her own small weak niche that conceals this powers that should have no place in the life of a woman.

Even when she is succeeding on all spheres with very little support from anyone else.

She will pour herself on a page of a weekend magazine and thank someone, anyone for her success. Thanking herself or acknowledging her strength would be immodest. And patriarchy detests immodest women.

It is why the cycle is broken. When it seems we are getting somewhere, we slip back a hundred times.

-Because the women who can truly free others are certain that their strength will be rebuffed even by female victims... and the ones who make plenty noise on social media about equality still desire patriarchy to help them out every other day.

One is genuinely afraid to share. The other is just a hypocrite.

And the victims remain victims.

Have you ever sat across a beautiful successful woman, divorced or widowed or never been married, with a few kids, a brilliant career, looking half her age...

And all the advice she gives YOU - you with zero income and large scars of domestic abuse in your life is...

"Go and submit quietly. It is well."

But madam... how nah? That is not even your reality.

Lol!

Madam gotta protect her own sanity in a crazy misogynistic patriarchal world.

I can't blame her.

YOU, seek out your own salvation.
