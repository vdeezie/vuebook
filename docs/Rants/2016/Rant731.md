When Oghenefego, our amazing street photographer sent in this picture for her daily column #PhotoSpeak on Happenings website...

My first reaction was to get the boy nice shoes and a school bag, and some money that could help with whatever he may need for a period of time.

It was as simple as that. 

Especially as I gathered from the incorrigible activist, Olorunfunmi Adebajo, that N30k can pay for a child's education for an entire year.

So yes, two pair of school shoes, a school bag and some educational stuff and money.

That's not charity. That's common sense. 

You see a child, he needs shoes... get him shoes.

Especially when you can't stop thinking about him. The picture really got to me. It is him I choose to support. 

So I asked Oghenefego if she could find the boy... maybe walk through the same route and ask for his mother's number.

She can't stay too long talking to a child, of course. It is wrong. Kidnappers are everywhere. All we need is a number.

Oghenefego gets the mother's number. We try it, but the line has been banned by the network provider.

What next? Can we get a father's number... so I can talk to the mother? (I prefer to deal with mothers in these type of situations)

Oghenefego takes the route again. But the boy says father is not in Lagos. 

"This is my number, give it to your mum. We just want to help," Oghenefego says. She has done the best she can. 

She tries to find the boy again a few more times... but it seems the boy doesn't take the route anymore. And I respect that. 

Maybe he got suspicious (a trait I strongly believe all children should have) and told his mother about this strange woman with a camera always talking to him.

Maybe his mum told him to take another route... that, again, I totally respect. 

I mean... who are we to want to "help" them?

I talk about poverty and dignity... and how it is important that they stick together. Just because you are poor shouldn't make you everybody's project.

Fuck that! 

Be poor and be proud. I can respect that.

Fuck Joy and Oghenefego and whatever we want to do. Who are we?

If the school allows a child to wear slippers to school and carry a polythene bag or shopping bag... who are we to decide it isn't good enough?

Are we dangling carrots at his poverty? Can we sustain this deed? If it wears out, won't he be back to wearing slippers? Will it not be a slight to his mum that we got him shoes we may not be disposed to buying every other month as the boy grows older? Will she be able to meet that shoe need next year? Will our effort not be some kind of mockery to their status?

What is charity anyway?

Sometimes respect the dignity of a poor person. Not every indigent family cares for your little faux middle-class "pretences".

I don't even know what I am saying sef.

But I respect whatever must have happened that the boy had to change his school route. 

May we know what it means to own a little pride.

PS: God bless Oghenefego for all the crazy errands she had to run just to find this young man.
