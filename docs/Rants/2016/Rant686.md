The discrimination of geniality. 

We expect gays, transgender people, feminists, fat people, short people, "ugly" people to act a certain way to be awarded by acceptance or recognition from the rest of humanity.

"She has a good heart." Is not a compliment if it follows an affirmation of her "lack of beauty".

We expect gays to be nice and gentle and kind and giving...

We expect trans people to be quiet and humble and large hearted.

We expect feminists to be all the things we cannot be. We want to live out perfection through them.

We want short men to have extra wisdom to make up for their lack of height...and a lot of money they can stand on.

We do not accept that these ones are equal to us (the irony, especially for feminists who actually fight for equality) if they cannot perform according to our expectations of them.

Fat women must be funny. If an obese woman cannot make you laugh then she isn't human  enough. 

We give out stereotype rules to people who dare to be different. And we say to them, "unless you can make me laugh then your fat is useless..."

"Unless you can endure my misogyny in a conversation then your feminism is too bitter."

"Unless you can still love God even in your state of gay sin, then you are no better than a dead dog."

We do not want people with labels to have the same flaws as the rest of humanity.

The cripple cannot have strong opinions. He must stay grateful for even seeing another day.

Things like that.

I write this because Noni Salma, the trans woman, is nothing like what we expect her to be.

She is not going to quote any religious script so you can fall in love with her or think her as nice. 

She curses like everyone else does. And I think it is refreshing.

Nothing gets on my nerves faster than people with labels trying to satisfy the curiosity of mere mortals or hoping to live up to expected rules and roles.

Noni just called someone a mop. Lmao! The person obviously went looking for her trouble first.

He needs to poke this insecure woman who used to be a man. He needs to make her realise she is useless, shit and not worthy. Some of them have the nerve to remind her of what "her type" suffers in Nigeria. 

I am relieved she doesn't think playing kind to these ones is necessary. She is not sending them kind notes of forgiveness. No.

Because if the rest of humanity is allowed to cuss out when offended, then Noni should too.

Unless you think of her as less than human then you'd expect her to "look the other way".

Noni will tell you to go fuck a tree...and then release a video where she pouts and plays with her hair. 

That's how you live.

If we all have a right to defend ourselves and attack people who disrespect us...then so does Noni! If she ever decides to walk away from any argument or hate or slander, let it be her decision. Not what we think or how we believe a trans woman should react. Do not box her. Heck! She just found her liberty, her voice. 

Face your front and mind your business.

I feel sorry for anyone that allows a label box them into a corner.

If you let human beings decide what you are...soon you'll realise you are living the life of a toilet paper.

It is the same expectations people have of me as a feminist. 

"Feminists should be nice. They should meet only by 6pm at a corner. They should wear only skirts. They should never raise their voices. They should never be angry. They should not be fashionable. They should preach only to market women..."

The irony!

I am fighting for my liberty and equality...yet they dangle chains and padlock in my face.

Here's to all the people with a label on...

Your decision to wear a tag is proudly YOUR decision. Do not give anyone the right to put cuffs on your wrist.

Your label frees you. It is freedom that led you to put a label on your breast pocket. You wanted to live your authentic life...

Do not let anyone turn your own liberty against you. Don't let them put your name on an orange jumpsuit.

Live. Freely.
