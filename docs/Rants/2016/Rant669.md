# Rant669

If you are on Facebook...

You are a student with alot of time on your hands and some money for data...

A bored housewife...

A wealthy (wo)man looking for some amusement...

A promiscuous male/female meeting up for sex...

An employee waaaay below management position who loves to gossip about people waaaay above your league...

A top manager who wants to connect to a flexible audience so as to introduce your company's latest products...

A writer with a lot on your mind...

Or bourgeoisie sect who just love to tell the world how cool disposable income is. 

Etcetera etcetera etcetera 

But what you are NOT is a billionaire. 

Billionaires do not stay on Facebook bragging. 

Billionaires create Facebook so that people like us can come and brag.

It doesn't matter how much of God you serve. The rules of success is never going to change.

If you want to truly succeed eventually...I mean real success- not just the ability to travel to Dubai and New York and be able to buy a car and a plot of land kind of success. 

I know too many people who can do that. Heck, that's doable. 

But if you really want to be an outstanding success, you will give up television (especially TV series)... and give up 90% of social media.

We know that is hard. It is why we are NOT drop dead successful yet. And why an extra million or two gets us excited (forget that after paying school fees there's just rags left in the account).

I know why I am here.

I am here to rant, and to annoy. As long as I am not being ignored, any kind of response is good for me- Love, Anger, Hate or Outrage. I am fine.

Because to hate suggests I reside in your heart, in your soul. And I like that I can torment you.

I also like mob mentality outrage. You know, foaming at the corner of your mouth, scratching your clits type of outrage. 

I know someone I have put in that state for over three years. She is never going to get over it.

Because when I warn you more than once...and you continue to think this is a tea party...I will unleash demons on you. And you can't fight me alone. No one ever truly fights me alone...

They need to collaborate with bloggers or beckon on a group of lazy thinkers to help out.

I have that kind of effect.

Oh! And I am also here to get media work done.

So that's me.

I am not here to tell you how to succeed.

But if you are a super achiever...

You won't be on Facebook. You won't even feel the need to put up pictures of vacation on Facebook like the rest of us. 

You will go to Abu Dhabi ten times, living in your own suite...meeting world business leaders...and there will be no desire to take selfies or lay pictures all over your FB wall.

So what's my point...

There are people you are obviously way better than on Facebook if you consider intellect, money and ambition...

However we are all on a straight line. Some are just waaaaay ahead. Sometimes you look back and remember how impossible it seemed that you could continue on that journey. But here you are.

And as glorious as that is... it would be good to kinda remember that someone is still ahead of you.

Some people are not on the line. Social media is still that ludo game they are yet to come around to play. They are busy making mint cash.

Chi-ching!!!

But it is not any of us, you hear?

We are all still very hungry for many breakthroughs.

So when I put up a post dedicated to the "Nigerian Employee"...

Do not be tempted to drop a comment that suggets we are mere "Facebookers"... and so do not know that buying trash can is the duty of management.

You are not doing me a favour being a "friend" oh. 

I am not using you for anything. You are not Nasco. You don't matter.

Your friendship does nothing for me. I am not using basic friendship to buy air ticket. So let's just keep Lol-ing and keep it sweet here.

I'm just saying. 

Have you witnessed ONE fight on my wall in like a hundred years? No nah. I will delete your comment, then I will delete you. I don't have time for argument. This is not NASS.

Go and cry on your wall and gather locusts there.

And for Employees reading this...

Buy your freaking trash can by yourself.

Then excel greatly at your job.

If your job loves you, love it back. 

Love it with great love.

Receive sense and do the right thing.

This Buhari economy is not smiling at anyone.

Toh!
