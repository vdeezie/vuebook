Nigerians, keep your jobs.

Many entrepreneurs are in debts...struggling to keep their heads above water...owing tax...owing state and local government many ridiculous levies...paying electricity bills through their anus...forking out money for diesel that can feed a small community...

There's maintenance of equipment, constant office requirements...paying of staff monthly...There's theft and arrest of scrupulous associates and employees...

There are bad cheques and prospective clients that never come through.

And there's very little money for all these needs and hungry, evil, desperate people all clawing for a piece of you.

From this position as a Managing Director on a payroll...where I can run a company without the burden of being the "money man", I can see clearly why you should ditch that idea of running a "small business" in Nigeria.

The sharks will come for you whether you are small or big. 

Ask the orange seller at Makoko... she still gets to pay the sharks (aka area boys) N2,000 or more for every tray of orange sold. 

Dear entrepreneurs, Nigeria will not let you be great. 

Shut your ears to those bloody sermons of entrepreneurship.

Keep your jobs! 

You can be bloody rich being an employee.

Yes, they lied to you! 

You can be rich as an employee...and be poor as a mouse as an entrepreneur. 

It all comes down to how you treat money. 

There's no glory in running a small business in a country like Nigeria where you'd rot in deep lack with the sharks surrounding you...

When you can have a smart job that is able to pay your rent and children's fees in one month's pay cheque. 

Why would you ever give that up just so you can be called a business (wo)man???

I know too many comfortable and fabulously rich employees...

And I know many struggling entrepreneurs.

And no, the rags to riches story is not true either. 

90% of entrepreneurs will not become rich.

You can run that small business for 10 years and all you'll be able to conquer is hunger...

Or you can get a job, work hard at it and have enough disposable income to travel to Dubai, and buy your favourite car.

See ehn, that all bullshit entrepreneurial motivational season is over.

Go and get a job.

I have seen homes where the businessman husband had to rely on his career-working wife for years when Nigeria licked his business dry.

PS: I know our parents were wrong about many things. But their obsession with careers were on point. 

Listen to them this one time.

Go and get a job in Shell biko and rest! 

PSS: This does not apply to one-man "plantation" without pay.
