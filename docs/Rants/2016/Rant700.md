Have you ever wondered about an event that happened when you were a kid...then years later you finally got a sense of perspective on what it was all about?

I remember when I was about 8 years old or younger...

A hawker would drop her tray of groundnuts under the stairs of an apartment building where my mother had her tailoring shop. 

She would head to one of the apartments in the two-storey building by 11am...and would be there till, about, 5pm.

When the day was over, she'd empty her goods at the nearest trashbin and stroll away. 

Money in her pocket for trading of a different kind.

I listened to the adults in my midst talk about what went on in the apartment. But my mind was too young to understand sex then.

***
Last week, as a grown woman of course, I saw a cassava-and-coconut hawker throw away her livelihood by the side of our apartment building. 

She was whistling. Counting money. She looked at her tray of "abasha", despised it. And kicked it away.

She found other ways of making quick money. 

Looks like cassava and coconut can go to hell.

***

These ones fucked to make the money they wanted for the day.

Ok.

But the script could have inspired a group of others. People in need of food should profit from this kind of decision nah. The kind venture of giving the goods to poor kids or a family that could do with the windfall. 

Freely you were able to think up fuck money... freely you should part with your goods.

It's just evil to throw it all away because you found another way of cashing in.

Let the cycle of kindness not be deterred by a trashbin.
