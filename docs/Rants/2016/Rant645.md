I will not participate in nurturing male privileges in a society already obese with patriarchal nourishment.

It is one reason I filed a report at the police station.

An ex-colleague threatened me.

And as far as I am concerned he did it because I am female. He wanted his privileges to work in his favour.

The-bitter-divorced-female-boss-who-oppresses-the-kind-hearted-family-man.

The kind of script this society loves to bask in.

He wanted to intimidate a female boss, because patriarchy tells him it is ok. 

He was employed as a producer. I didn’t want him at first- it must have been that aura that I hate, that air of entitlement that some men carry around. I ignored him. But I succumbed eventually because it seemed my only excuse tilted towards sexism.

To prove me wrong, he came with all the niceties.

“You are beautiful, boss,” he’d praise.
“Your dress is so lovely, boss,” he’d sing.
“You look amazing, boss…”

Each day came with its own compliment.

I tried to be kind. I smiled. I nodded. And demanded that work be done.

Three months later, and N300k richer, I wasn’t satisfied with his work. No, I wasn’t.

Not even the praises could stop me from telling him to give it up. 

At first I wanted him to buckle up, one more month I’d give to see if he could get it right. 

But his response to my mail was what sealed it for me- a list of his accomplishments *yawn*

Is that the response you give when your boss is totally dissatisfied with your job?

I rolled my eyes, and sacked him.

Carry your accomplishments and go! I want results. 

I owed him nothing. The company paid every month…

So when he started the threats, I couldn’t understand it.

“I will destroy everything,” he shouted on the phone. And then managed to send some typical text messages…

“That is why your marriage ended…I will open your nyash…”

And I was left wondering… what exactly is wrong with this “soft spoken” bastard who has managed to fool everyone except me.

I've known this fool for only three months. What gives him the right to attack me?

I have fed fat on Crime and Investigation. I know the gimmicks of the Arowolos and the Shondes…

And one rat whose breath and smelly socks I couldn’t stand wants to threaten me? In this Lagos??!

The insult!

So I got my lawyer and the police involved.

It’s been four days now…

Today, we met at the DCOs office.

An undertaking has been signed.

The police treated me well. They empathized.

We need to trust our police officers a little more.

I hear he was working on a defamatory article *yawn*

-Because he thinks it is easy to shame a woman.

This fool worked at StarFM without pay, and was owed for months at DBN…

But he didn’t attack the men who used his salary for family vacation and range rovers…

He attacked me who ensured he was paid every month even with little faith in his primary duty.

I don’t have a life- all I do is work…yet someone wants to shame me?

Shame me? Are you mad?!

With what exactly?

Dare me. 

I will take you through the most grueling legal journey of your life! I will ensure you spend every penny left in your pocket to pay lawyers.

(Some) men of this generation, a total disgrace.

He has called everyone within my circle of influence, trying to sow some kind of distrust. A desperate bastard.

"Do you want Joy to take you back?" One of my friends asked him when he disturbed her peace with a call to talk-about-Joy.

"err...may be," he said.

Thunder fire you! 

He must think this is some kind of Reality TV series where people fight and make up.

You must not have heard about me.

Stupid as stupid does.

Cool your feet in police custody.
