If it is ok to celebrate certain men getting more than one wife- a decision supported by culture, religion, leadership, location, age or wealth...

Then why do we make a fuss when other men cheat? Polygamy starts first by cheating on someone. 

These marriages are easily accepted by contemporary Nigerians. They attend the ceremonies, they shower praises and even have the audacity to tell the rest of us that, somehow, this penis penetrating a new vagina will bring forth some form of development to indigenes.  

If we accept it for some, why can't we accept it for others?

Why do we have people wailing to "agony aunts" about cheating husbands and boyfriends?

How then is he going to find a new woman and hold a new ceremony that we can support in attaining new development through missionary sex?

Why are you complaining about your man texting another woman when you rejoiced with your uncle, your father, your neighbour and those Obas for obtaining new chattels?

Why is polygamy treated discrimantely? Do we accept it only for some? 

Do men have a right to four wives or not? Why should location and custom stand as criteria?

It is this kind of hypocrisy that annoys me.

Can you not all make up your minds what you stand for?

You are hustling to get asoebi to attend a man's wedding to a second wife, whilst you tuck your own partner under your armpit. 

If he smiles to any woman order than you (and those you have permitted him to get close to), you will give her that wicked look that is reserved for witches. 

Come, let me give you a dirt slap.

You are stomping your feet against polygamy on social media...meanwhile your father is about to get married to a 17 year old in the village. 

Polygamy is clearly a non-issue in Nigeria, stop making it one. 

When adults decide to have orgies every night under the umbrella of marriage...

How can that be wrong? 

If you have to fight for something...

Fight against child bride.

Leave adult women to make dumb decisions.
