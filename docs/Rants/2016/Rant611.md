It is a good day for us to remember that we are our own problem.

Women hating on women is not a myth.

It is not something we think up when we are horny. 

A majority of women are against the message of equality because it denies them the comfort of dependency. 

The idea of being a complete being without attachments to men or friends or something-anything frightens the next woman.

Feminism is shamed mostly by other women who are policing our movement. 

They need to be sure we do not want to take over men. Whatever that means.

The word "Feminazi" was coined by a whale...sorry, woman.

It was a female lecturer who said recently that girls are to be blamed for rape...and men do not know when they commit a crime of rape because most times they would have been seduced.

It was a woman who clearly stated that I should read between the lines as an editor to understand what a writer had written regarding this statement:

"Men must rape- whether child or adult if women tempt them."

Or something like that. 

We had a huge fight about it on social media while the closet rapist sat back and twiddled his penis. 

The entire feminist cause is attacked by women who can neither fit in nor bother to understand it.

It was on LIVE television that a female presenter said that these 13 year old girls love getting married to older men.

And this is just scratching the surface.

Women fight everything except their abusive partners.

It is what makes the journey very intriguing. 

It is impossible for half the world to bring down the remaining half of it without the solid backing and support from within the other half.

And there lies our doom.

It was a woman who attacked a rape victim for daring to bring the police to their home to arrest her rapist brother.

She has been charged to court. From where she'd be sent to her new home- kirkiri maximum prison, until she can meet her bail condition.

I know y'all hate to hear this...

Y'all want to believe your secret groups are very secret and there's oneness of purpose. 

It is in denial that we birth all the issues we suffer as women...

From staying with below average blokes to keeping up with frenemies...

The woman loves to hurt herself, and everyone else around her.

Yes, I have been told these are my own delusions and women are actually chummy with one another.

I believe you.

Nobody is holding your freedom from you. 

Why we need to celebrate one day to mark a struggle... and why we need to wait till 2033 to have a feel of equality in a world where our gender is not a minority... 

Goes to tell the story of the animal who eats its own flesh to kill its hunger. 

Your traditions and anti-female customs are upheld by women. 

Under the pretext of culture we perpetuate hate that degrades the dignity of women.

Truth is: there is no son who shames women without the help of his most prominent female influence.

He simply echoes and lives out years of brainwashing.
