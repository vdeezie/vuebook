In the last week...

I got over 2,000 new followers here. 

Just in one week.

I did a post that gathered over 6,000 likes and over 3,500 shares.

E be like dream. 

If only these things can translate to some kind of money! Financial analysts where art thou?!

Now here is one that can truly translate to income:

I did a special programme on #WhereIsCharityAiyedogbon. A programme that was inspired by Viola's article on sabinews. 

If it wasn't for her, it would have been another disappearance that would get my sympathy before the next distraction happens. 

The analytics came in today...

5,000 people listened to that programme!!!

I jumped out of my seat and kissed my screen.

Happenings Radio got 100% increase in listenership in the last week. 

I had to turn my phone upside down incase I was reading figures that weren't correct. 

The Magazine Show on Tuesday after a hilarious weekend of average women throwing tantrums and eating bra straps, had 1,800 listeners!

My people, I have been struggling with less than 500 listeners for months! 

And one weekend...just one weekend with a retarded post with my name on it...

And I am getting 100% increase in overall online patronage! 

Something I wouldn't get if I paid Linda Ikeji to carry my Ad for one year!

The clicks could be for mockery... It could be that they wanted to find out if I "survived" an amateur mud fight. 

I was painting my nails all weekend and thinking of what benefit this could mean for me ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

Fortunately, all the clicks was to my pride, to my benefit. 

I can't even hate you Female in Nigeria niggaz.

I see your numbers all over my business in the last week. 

If I can keep up these ratings then I can formally make a presentation to prospects. 

So please can we do it again?

Can you get mad again? I can supply the bra straps.

Get mad for one of your own and give me more numbers. Please!

I'm begging.

Thank you as you consider your bandwagon-ed outrage. Again.

And to everyone else, thank you for a great last week!
