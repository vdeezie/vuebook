When excessively rich politicians who have no business being so excessive in riches fight...

We are supposed to pick sides.

Dino is wrong. How dare he threatens Remi with his dick and yuck sperm?

No married woman should disrespect another woman's husband by calling him a thug. Remi you are way outta line.

The arguments continue. For Dino. For Remi.

Dino is strutting on Bourdillon street to prove he is fearless. 

Remi is seething somewhere and planning a checkmate. Afterall, she is Jagaban's wife. It might take a few months or years...but he will "strike". It is the nature of his kind.

I can't even lose a strand of hair for Remi.

Her kind are well protected from men like Dino. Forget what you read. They will hug it out in a meeting soon enough. And if they don't, they'll stay out of each other's way. None of this will affect the handsome cheque they collect every month...while the rest of us try to understand what the hell this Buhari economy is doing to our businesses. 

This distraction that will plunge us into more economic grief. These people care more about their egos than the state of the nation.

The real fight is out here amongst the poor and middle class. 

Remi is not out here fighting for the girl child. She didn't get harassed on the streets whilst protesting for the alarming rate of child rape. Or vehemently putting an end to the plight of widows.

She is sitting in "power" that gives the kind of money that can heal a broken city... and was threatened with penis and fist from a thug.

Half the police force will protect her...whilst a 13 year old girl is still mocked for getting raped when she braves all and heads to the police station with her friend. True story.

She will turn back and return to the home of her rapist.

Nobody stands for her.

Nothing changes.

I think we should all just focus on what this thug and this woman and her kind sitting on top our future have to offer us and our children.

Let them tear their shirts and blouses if they want...it is worth tearing. They are ruining our lives...and there's very little left for our children.

It is harder for women in Nigeria. Because when you fight for the likes of Remi...

You may think you are fighting for the plight of women.

You will win this Remi fight on social media. She was never really in danger. 

It is still her kind that will not stand up and ensure something as simple as a bill on equality is passed.

She may not stop it, but she will not lose an acrylic nail over it.

Her kind will say to the nation that God has put her in this position to tame the way women expose their bodies...and ask that they be harassed by policemen by passing a law against "indecent dressing".

Her kind will blame women for being raped "because men don't know when they actually rape."

Her kind, I say. Maybe not her. But her kind.

How many women in power have truly brought about real change for the girl child?

How many are preaching new thinking to liberate women from the shackles of religion and culture?

We are not in the same world with these people. She doesn't represent the voice of women in Nigeria. She represents power, and power will be fine.

Power in a third world will always be fine.

You need to look out for yourselves.

Try and get a little money. It will save you alot of shame.

Nigerian police harasses you...you flip a few notes out and be on your way.

What's the point playing activist when you will be thrown in prison, and even your mother will blame you for "trying to insist that N200 is bribery"?

A hashtag will appear in your name...and after one week everyone forgets you. 

You will stay in prison for 6 months for no reason. And there'll be no record to prove anything.

You have no power. Don't use your last drop to fight for someone with a full tank.

Who remembers that journalist that was tortured by Ohakim? 

So many people harassed by power for "insulting their wives" or "writing dirt about them".

These "wives" will be fine, I tell you.

How about you? Are you fine?

Pay your way out of every discomfort. 

Find some money and plan your children's education. Save the rest for when you want to elope out of this disaster.

Don't look at me like that.

This is the country made by Remi and Dino.

She doesn't know what it is to be poor, female and Nigerian. 

She will seethe her way to the Carribeans for summer...lock out everyone from a designer store...and feed her burning anger with nice things. 

The rest of us will still be here...trying to get justice for a widow raped by her late husband's younger brother and asked to move out of her matrimonial home with 5 minors into the street.
