In Lagos...

You park at a random spot where cars are parked randomly, near your mother's house...waiting for your kids to drag their bags down to you...

Someone will knock on your car, ask that you move away so they can "sell" their NairaBet figures of the week plastered on a board. Somehow, your random spot is theirs... and they have numbers they want their lottery-obsessed people to see... and you with your car in the way is a wicked obstruction.

In Lagos...

You instruct your neighbour to take charge of their sibling with mental illness, because you have children- GIRLS you need to protect... but you become the villain. They stop speaking to you because somehow they believe you are suppose to live with it. This time-bomb ticking is supposed to be ignored. And we can all just pray it never gets out of hand. Again and again. Or sing hakuna matata.

Makers of "potable water" in Lagos are on strike. Over something. I am not sure, cost of this-and-that. 

Now water is scarce. Like everything else in Nigeria, "pure water" is not an alternative, it is the only solution to our collective thirst. At this hour of national frustration, a bag costs N200.

I have come to my conclusions...

1) the NairaBet individual is an idiot.

2) my neighbours do not mean me well (we shall head to court soon if they don't care for their own responsibility)

3) Nigeria is a flipping joke and any cry for patriotism deserves a slap.
