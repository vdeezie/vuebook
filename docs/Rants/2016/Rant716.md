The practices in many societies…

In Egypt, girls are expected to take mandatory virginity tests for admittance in higher learning.

In Malawi, to prepare girls for men, they are sent to a "hyena" for fuck lessons on how to please men. Some of these "hyenas" are infected with terminal sexual diseases.

In certain Nigerian culture, girls are stored in a barn and fed fat so they can be desirable to men for the all-important ambition of Marriage.

In many African communities, girls are denied education based on their gender, so that the little income in the family can be invested in the education and the future of the boy child.

In Libya, women who protest in political revolutions are made victims by the same “brothers” they stumped the streets with. Because after the revolution is won, the vagina needs to be subdued.

In China, with the one-child policy… when a woman discovers she is expecting a girl child, she terminates the pregnancy to try again at getting a boy… to see just maybe she’d get the "prize", the blessing of the preferred gender this time.

In Ajangbadi, Lagos, Nigeria: To protect her husband from finding another woman, a mother connives with her husband and his penis to rape their 8 year old… to keep the man from, err, cheating.

In Nigeria, a 5 year old is raped by a 43 year old neighbour… and the community protects the rapist, harassing and threatening the lawyer handling the case and the police… and demanding that their, err, community leader will solve the rape case.

In India, if a girl is raped, she is expected to marry the rapist or go to jail for fornication.

It’s a sex binge in Nigerian universities, lecturers own office tables full of vagina stories that they revel in. Yet not ONE lecturer has been charged and/or sent to jail for sexual misconduct or abuse.

A woman is expected to be ashamed of having sex… for a man it is a trophy. So boys go on social media groups to brag about rape… and the girls in the social media groups STAY IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA GROUPS… and in some odd circumstances, the girls DEFEND the boy as they caution the public to stay out of it, “You do not know how this group runs, we are just having fun, don’t condemn what you don’t understand” and all other sad tales of idiocy.

Religion demands that a woman sits through bouts of sermons to be tutored on how to be inferior to a man… and how to love this inferior position… and how to interprete this inferior position as actually being superior (neck vs head analogy)… and how to attack anybody that tries to take away their blessed position of inferiority… and then they raise women representatives who teach other women and girls on how to be beautiful according to their inferior position to the man.

A woman in her 50s succeeds greatly in her career, but she needs to pay a publicist to try to hush one lousy sex adventure she had with a man many years ago… as a SINGLE woman oh! A woman who has every right to sex and adventure; a woman who has rights to paint her own colours of life was threatened with a flimsy sex accusation by a loser. Because women should never truly expect to appreciate the joys of sex. Yet a less successful male who has slept with every girl in view is judged based on half-baked success littered everywhere and not his sexual exploits.

YET with all these facts from across the world (and those right under our noses), adults with brains are waiting for Chichi Nnani, Temidayo Ahanmisi and one troublemaker called Joy to write one “Gbammest” article so they can drop a comment with their hands in the air to declare that “Now I understand Feminism”.

You are waiting for a human being like you to do a post that suits your bias so you can finally decree that “this is the best post on Feminism; now I understand”.

Your endorsement, does it put food on my table?

This mental laxity is not cute at all.

This kind of conformity and orthodoxy is not cool or flattering. At all.
