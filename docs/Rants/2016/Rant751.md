Question:

If, in some ways, Maje influenced Toke's decision to bleach her skin (because rival is half Lebanese, half Ibibio) as her memoir implies...

Would it be fair to say that Toke influenced Maje to become the man whose story had to be told in an entire book dedicated to demon behaviour?

You will not come alive, out of a midst of feminists, if that question hits the ground. 

And that is the issue.

Forming gang with sisters-in-feminism, clamping down on every question that doesn't sit right with your nappy hair is not going to bring about any form of change. 

Men will rise to defend their gender.

Feminists will rise to defend their own convenient gender bias.

And the rest of humanity (in this case, millions of Nigerians) will be left with questions they are too afraid to ask. 

To save face, they will shout along the lines of: "burn the demon, burn Maje"...

But they will continue to love the "Maje" in their lives.

Not for the sake of hypocrisy, but because we- the so called "enlightened" burn their questions from the fire we spit out of our mouths. 

Feminists tell Nigerians that their questions are stupid. It is why many people poke fun at the movement. Nobody wants to be called stupid. 

May it not be a man who would ask such a question... 

He would be burned like a steak, and served as lunch in the gathering of feminists. 

You know I have been there, right?

I can tell you for a fact that you are not changing the world with all your back-and-forth gender tripe.

People want to know. It is not a crime not to know. They are really lacking understanding of the things you talk about. 

But you don't exactly know what you talk about... because you haven't read enough or questioned enough. You just need so desperately to fit into the new culture of "badass women who don't take shit from no one".

I don't even know which is worse: A woman under patriarchal hold OR the feminist picking at trifling gender issues.

I tell my children to question everything. 

It is what we say about religion. Question your religion.

Question everything. Even this Nigerian feminism you practice.

Let all the valid questions that can come out of a conversation be asked.

Let Toke sit down and be questioned by a very intelligent presenter (hopefully not a feminist)...

Because this all-men-are-scum narrative is not good for boys of our daughters' age to inherit.

We will be recycling the same shit.

They will rise to defend their gender...

And the cycle continues.
