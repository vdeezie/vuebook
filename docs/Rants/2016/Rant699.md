Dear Nigerians...

If I fall sick and I do not ask to start up a Fund Me cause.... please do not put my picture up on your social media platform for a prayer charade.

Please.

Respect my sickness. Respect my privacy. Pray in your heart. Shield me from your judgments and public Amens. 

Social media thrives on schadenfreude.

For Nigerians, the architects of pretense, there's the prayer that distances itself from the pain of the sufferer in praise of being "righteous" enough to escape a barrage of ills... from poverty, to recession, to barrenness, to cancer. 

I am yet to understand how "type Amen" can heal anyone.

Displaying pictures of the Sick (Except a fundraising initiative) or the Dead on social media is cruel.

It shows just one thing- how grateful you are NOT to be the one on a sick bed. It's selfish congratulation for your own health or wealth depending on whether we are "praying" for the sick or poor.

God is not on social media.

Post the picture in your heart and pray with your family for the sick. OR contribute to his/her hospital bills. And let it be.

When the sick decides to share pictures of his/her pain...it will be his/her decision.

It's so easy to shred people's dignity in a third world. It's so easy.

We can live in a third world country...

But try not to think like a product of a third world mess.
