To the millenial woman in 2017:

If you do not have school fees to pay, stop school for a few years and join the labour force. Get paid employment, get experience that can be sold. Save your pennies, then go back to school. If the Nigerian educational institution stands in your way of a flexible life, then bring that issue to social media... let us question why Nigeria should make organised schooling a full time job.

Heck, learn a trade and make money from it. Place a table in the open market and see what it must feel like to sell crayfish, palm oil, plantain. Find a poultry and sell eggs. Education is a life long pursuit, if circumstances prove tough then let schooling wait while you discover your world and what your hands can do.

-Because you cannot sustain an attitude of loans and financial help from random people. Random soliciting is not what should define the years of your youth. It is a blessing to be young, not a curse. It is the moment to touch the sky, to take risks, to climb the highest mountains, to go ski-diving, to change the rhythm of the life society imposes.

It is the time of sweet rebellion. The years of the impossible. The period of many smart mistakes and not-so-smart successes.

Do not spend it like a woman who has lived a full life and is seeking the favours of the world.

Don't. Beg.

Don't build a life around the need for people to help you. 

You are the mother of dragons. You can walk through fire and be unscathed. You should know your power.

Youth requires that you pave your own way. And live on your own terms. 

Your own terms would mean that you will have none of that social structures holding you down. You'll bring the walls down and build a fountain in its place. 

What are you doing with the years of the eagle- when you can live carelessly and freely and in control?

Please live with the kind of pride that... if you have to choose "ordinary" or "death"...

You just might choose base jumping.

If you are in a relationship do not suck on the trifling moments of "love" without questioning the constant theme of reproach with your partner. Waiting for drops of soda at the bottom of the bottle and reminiscing on the sweetness of the drops that fell on your tongue is pathetic.

It cannot quench your thirst.

You are young. And whether you believe you are beautiful or not, you are powerful. In a changing world power is more important than beauty. Your powers only requirement is to control your choices.

Be strong enough to embrace. Be strong enough to walk away. Be strong enough to start again. Be strong enough to become who you want to become.

That's power that changes you. And when you change YOU, the world around you changes. 

This is my five naira which you can throw in a bin or invest in a bank and patiently watch out its returns.

It's still your life to live.

If I have any N5 left to trade, I'll be back.
