When Nigerians tell you: "But atleast you should have done something"...

This is what they mean:

When a mob gathers to burn a victim to ashes, YOU need to stand between the petrol and the match stick about to go up in flames, and try to reason with the mob to spare the life of the individual.

Since "reasoning" is not something Nigerians do well, you should willingly give your life to this cause of saving the victim. Burn with the victim to show your pain for a failed Nigerian state.

In normal societies, all you need do is dial 911.

When an accident occurs, YOU need to wear your superman cape... leave your bags in the commercial vehicle, fly over traffic to the injured person... what next? Oh shoot! 911 doesn't happen around here. Now you need to prove to the police you weren't the cause of the accident, OK bribe your way through this one. Then fly through fifteen hospitals, find the one with at least basic health facilities.

In working societies, all you need do, in the safety of your own car or through your window... is dial 911.

When an armed robber is trying to get the phones off the lady in front of you in traffic... Alight from your car, grab the edge of his gun, command him to be a good Christian and stop stealing. Take a bullet if need be.

In proper societies, all you need do really is dial 911.

Normally, risking lives is the job of people who sign up to the Army, to The Police, to Jesus Christ. 

The average citizen becomes a hero when he does the job of the police.

In Nigeria however, we do not only lack police protection... the police serves as a hindrance to any good deed.

Hear Obi Eze:

"On the day my old man passed on, my brother was driving to owerri from port-harcourt.. He happened along an accident scene and being the nice-guy he usually is, stopped to offer what assistance he could. He picked up two of the victims who happened to be related to each other..one was totally covered in blood and unconscious, the other with an arm twisted backwards at the elbow and moaning constantly in pain.. At the hospital, they were rejected/delayed over a police report..at the police station my brother was held on suspicion of being the cause of the accident..it took the word/pleading of the still conscious accident victim to get him free.. The unconscious victim was pronounced DOA by the time they got back to a hospital..and there was my brother, his car seats covered in blood, totally frustrated, and still unaware his own dad has passed just three hours earlier..."

I think people who try to advise you to conquer the failed and corrupt structures of the police and the health system are extreme hypocrites.

We tell our sportsmen to represent our country. We sit on social media and order people around on how to respond or act.

Even when you do right as a Nigerian; e.g: win a female soccer tournament... there's the foolish disgraceful Nigerian Solomon Dalung holding onto power, making your life miserable. 

You must think soliciting for funds to release kidnapped children, help sick relatives, bring back a national team or clothe them in nicer costumes...are normal practices.

You must think we are building Nigeria when we do these things.

You cannot change this country from sponsoring 30 children to public school. Great initiative, yes. But our rot is deeper than those acts of graciousness. 

Do these good deeds, please. But structures are what will make it possible for every child to get good education and every citizen good healthcare. 

I will not instruct anybody to be superman in this country. You will die like a chicken... 

Then who will take care of your children?

See what they did to Keshi, even in death. 

Be a hero in Nigeria at your own peril. 

Let me die of mosquito bite instead. God forbid that I die for Nigeria.

To be a victim of any kind in this country is the worst kind. Ever.

I hate this country too much to even care.
