Facebook wants to know what's on my mind...

Ok. Let's spill it out!

#

I heard the story of someone who was treated like a mop in her marriage. She left the marriage and wanted a job.

I was quick to employ her. I wasted no time.

After a few months, I realised she was a snitch. I can't go into details but I didn't feel safe anymore with her around.

She talked alot. Complained about work. Murmured to her colleagues. 

She was spreading foul air, and I watched my team helplessly carry that look of despair. 

She was contagious like a bad disease.

I don't like being helpless, so I sacked her. I kept her dignity intact and held a private meeting with her and my assistant...

And terminated her employment.

24 hours later, one of her "mentors" wrote a lousy sub (yawn) about how people will finally get to know the "real you".

That should be me, of course. People will finally get to know the real me. I hear you.

You were there when your protégé didn't have a job. I got her one. But since cliquing was more important to her than getting paid, I set her free...

Just shut up ehn. Be a good mentor and get her a job.

I was paying her N90k. Keep that fee up or make it better.

Then we can come back here and have that conversation about "real people".

Shior.

Another one, Facebook (since you want to know all that is on my mind)...

One of my writers have perfected the art of plagiarism. 

It is so embarrassing that she would stoop so low as to steal from sites like 360nobs!

For god sake, what kind of embarrassment is that?!!

She wrote a piece on Yoruba boys. I read it and I was sure I had seen it some place else.

I sent a mail immediately, cc-ing my assistant, asking this writer to confirm that the article was an original piece. 

She swore with thunder that it was.

Why shouldn't I believe her?

I have been focused on Happenings Radio, I haven't had the time to follow up daily on the website.

I have an assistant. Why should I kill myself? And why, for chrissake, should I doubt the authenticity of articles on my site???

Someone help me understand!

I even heard she's been plagiarising for quite sometime.

So she sits in a chair all day, copy stuff from other sites...and gets a salary at the end of the month.

I sacked her ass a minute ago.

Wrote her a stinker and kicked her plagiarist ass out of my life.

Uugh!
