A mix of religion and desperation is lethal.

If you have to be religious, don't demand anything from it. 

Don't ask for a child. 

Don't desire a husband/wife.

Don't wish for a job.

Don't thirst for money or "milk and honey" or whatever ridiculous term religion likes to qualify wealth. 

Don't look out for incredible testimonies. There's every likelihood that the person who testified of being cured of HIV is still taking his meds  (which isn't a bad thing...but the lies...). The woman and the miraclous birth probably had a sperm donor or IVF.

Don't approach religion with a need. Period.

That way your brain is screwed on right.

So if a pastor tells you he has holy sperm... or he can predict your future by sucking your breasts... or can make you wealthy if you sow your children's school fees... you can tell his fraud.

Befriend religion for the purpose of curiosity, leisure or satire. 

Anything but desperation. 

Don't take it seriously, and don't panic when it tells you God will jump down from His throne and slap you. 

Religion is not smart. You are just too desperate.
