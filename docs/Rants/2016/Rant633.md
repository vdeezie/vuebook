You're born into a family- parents who told you what to do, what to wear, how to speak, what to become. A mini version of themselves...or what they failed to become. 

The pressure is on: "be friends with my best friends daughter," they say. 

"Study architecture like your dad," they advice. 

Your older siblings want you to conform to certain rules to make life easy for them.
*
In school, the construction of this thing called you continues. 
Be early. Be tidy. Show respect. Don't respond. Go on one knee. Smile. Don't smile. Read harder. Harder. Harder.
*
You read books- those sneazy teenage materials. They tell you what you should look like. What you shouldn't look like. How you should look the way you need to look to be accepted.

TV series telling you how to fall in love. How to be the coolest girl in the crowd. How to pout your lips.

Billboards subtly remind you of everything everyone has been trying to tell you- you are not good enough. That's why you ain't on any billboard.

*

You embrace religion. Your woes have multiplied. New rules to follow. New ways to tell how unfit you are to live a good life, incapable of making heaven.

*

You date someone. He wants to be sure you dress like a lady, wear ruby woo, hold a nice smile for the boys. Do not speak too loud or have opinions. Smile more. Sex more. Don't argue. Be wife material. Lose some weight. Tone a bit. Don't try to start an argument. Be an acceptable girl with natural appeal to the opposite sex. 

*

You get a job. Your boss wants you to be early. Speak a certain way to clients. Dress a certain way. Be a certain way. Earn a certain wage.

*

You get married. 

Your mother-in-law has a set of rules. So do your sister-in-laws, some of them not even worthy to clean your shoes. Brother-in-laws expect certain things of you.

The marriage has its own obligations.

When children arrive, they expect certain motherly attributes to make life good.

*

You are almost 40 and you have lived everybody's life.

When are you going to say all the fucks you have swallowed many times at the tip of your tongue?

When will you explore your own self for your own sake?

When can you shout, run, fly, jump, curse?

When do you plan to sing your own song? Belch your own way? Find your true purpose?

When will you shut the world out and listen to your gut feeling? 

When can you be you? This crazy or kind or annoying or bad tempered or sweet YOU.

When do we get to that point where our lives belong to us and nobody else?
