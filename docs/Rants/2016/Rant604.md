I wish I was quiet. I wish I didn't speak my mind. I wish I wasn't so controversial. That I let things die naturally. I wish I cared about all these random friends trying to contain their like or dislike of my persona. I wish I had a slightly longer head. I wish I did not feel the need to air my opinion. But this is me and I am really wishing...

*big fat yawn*

If I ever sound this ridiculous, know that my motive for this type of post is vile, and I am only hoping to gather as many dumb fucks to remind me that I am awesome the way I am...and the quiet women aren't.

People need validation. Especially when it seems things are slow around them. They need to hear others tell them they are pretty or in the right body.

"I wish I had the perfect Kim Kardashian complexion. I wish I was thinner. But I am sexy just the way I am."

See the contradiction in this mess of a wish. One minute you want Kim's colour...the next minute you are sexy as you are.

Don't you know how to make your wish come true? Ask Toke Makinwa and spare us the bull crap.

We are full of bull. 

You can't make up your mind whether to fix your insecurities or invest it in the business of hating.

Why don't you just go straight to commending your stump of a figure as sexy instead of dragging another woman in...when you know those who will leave comments will try to rubbish any wish to make you feel good about yourself. 

Making comparisons that will generate condescending comments which you wait gaily to respond with "very true" or "awww thank you".

The motive is vile. I would rather a woman who comes out to say, "fuck that shit, I am hot," with a tummy rolling on the floor...

Than a woman who starts this holy epistle of how she isn't perfect but is yet perfect all in the same breath.

"I wish I could be taller but I am so proud of my short height."

It's the same shit we bring into our relationships with men...

"Honey I know you like girls with longer legs but these legs of mine are made to love you."

What is that?

It's either he likes your dwarfed stumps or he doesn't. Stop patronizing yourself. And stop laying ambush for society to bash other women.

Because the response you are holding your breath for will come and it will be packed with lies...

"Sweetheart, those long legs on some women are ugly. I like the big fat tuber you carry around."

In typical social media form, people are going to show up with 'awwws' and 'ooohs' to try to make you see how fabulous you are just-the-way-you-are. How being you is just perfect, and your wish list is not necessary.  

Our insecurities show in many dumbfounding ways.

Motive is everything. Why we do what we do is what you should focus on when you decide to let people into your life.
