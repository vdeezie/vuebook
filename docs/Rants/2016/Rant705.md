I sincerely don't understand why people are attacking "First lady Ibiene" regarding her anti-feminist position. 

We have had many women stand against Feminism here on social media. 

We have heard Ooni's wife give a lousy speech against equality.

There are female lecturers who blame rape victims... we have female politicians and women in power whose first duty is to attack the lifestyle and "dressing" of other women.

Don't-Wear-Trousers-To-This-Government-Parastatal and all other shit.

Viola Okolie (a woman I have come to respect largely for standing behind Chacha's disappearance), doesn't stand for Feminism. She calls angry feminists "Feminazis"....

A sabinews writer Abiodun Kuforuji has spent an entire writing career on her issues with feminism. 

And many others.

So, what makes Ibiene's anti-feminist position different? Why is it causing so much uproar. Isn't she entitled to change her mind?

Are we going to pretend that Nigerian feminists work in unity? Many of you just wear a tag, you don't live by any feminist principles. 

You build mediocre cliques and empower only the people who you call friends. Your idea of empowering a woman is only when she is part of your deliberate set-up.

Feminists like Omotoyosi Ogunbanwo are trolls by profession, looking for anywhere to eat free rice, free cake or free trouble. 

How can you blame Ibiene for changing her mind?

Why don't you re-evaluate your feminism instead?

Feminism in Nigeria is a bloody joke. Converts will retreat. You are a mess. 

It's the same way people question religion when they find that their tithes end up at a Mercedes shop...or at a Gucci store. 

Feminism with no dignity. No self-respect.

Ogunbanwo will attack me on a retarded post made by Nk'iru who has spent her entire worth trying to pin me to some personal crime...and then jumps at the sound of a needle dropping on grass to claim I insulted her daughter...

One stupid pity post and you find Ogunbanwo's jobless head in it...fighting her own bra straps and eating her weaves.

When she is done trolling...

She tunes to #HappeningsRadio, my creation... and wins my cake! LMAO!

Shameless. 

Yet these people have an opinion about a woman who clearly comes out to renounce their so-called behaviour?

If I wasn't sold on my own knowledge of Feminism, I will renounce Nigerian feminsm too.

We don't have feminists in Nigeria...

We have a group of thirsty women with little ambitions looking for the nearest mob they can enrol in.

Making stupid useless noise on social media... effecting no change...

Filling their empty souls with as much cyber violence as they can gather.

If someone like Chichi Nnani fights Ibiene, I can understand that. Her entire texts on social media describe her as a no-nonsense feminist sold out on its mission.

But Ogunbanwo... one minute she is dissing angry feminists, prescribing how we should be...

The next minute she is dragging a woman by the hair, questioning why she should give up feminism.

A mess. A complete disaster, that one.

I'll rather have Ibiene on my table for lunch than that mediocre piece of manipulation called Ogunbanwo.

This entire Ibiene bashing is like an episode on Punk'd.

Fuck out of here abeg! All of you!
