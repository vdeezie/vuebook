Hello All.

Are there any Ghanaian social hang-outs?

Are there soirees? Get-together? Civilised gatherings for light amusement and/or new knowledge sharing?

Any social or loosely-corporate networking physical platforms?
.

If there are, permit me to share a few rules, kindly...

I don't want to be around people who compare their level of success with friends I don't even know about. Bitch, I don't care. 

You can brag a little. But brag like the British. Not like a ghetto gangster from the Bronx with a gold tooth or like an Igbo wo(man) "droving" his car into his compound. 

Eww.

Brag with wit. Be a little self-deprecating, especially when you are pretty or handsome or successful. 

Always have a full bowl of empathy to pour on a conversation.

I am new to this country.

The first people I met made me believe I will not be able to get a job higher than 1,500 ghc and I won't be able to afford a decent place.

-Because creative industry is poor.

I left them, cleansed myself of bad energy (by using Nzuri body wash and face/body scrub 😉😄😘😍)...

And I moved on to align myself with positive vibes.

Then Emilia happened.

And my entire belief system (about working in Ghana) changed.

E.N.E.R.G.Y.

"You must earn like a top managment banker in Ghana, Joy. Else, all of this is not worth it."

Ah! My God!! I still get goose bumps talking about it. Whew!

And here I am - exactly as she predicted. And it took me just 4 days to get it!

My point is...

I want to attend soirees and hangouts and camaraderies with a bunch of Emilias every other week.

Emilia is not just a person. She is a mindset.

She is the right energy. 

Gerrit?

So if these types of social gatherings exist, hook me up.

PS: I don't do broken women gatherings.

PSS: Here's my picture, so you know I am a gentle lady. 

Thanks 😊
