Genny of life.

She's not rushing home to cook egusi for anybody.

Not fighting side chicks.

Not showing receipts. 

Not buying the weight of any man's philandering.

Not covering up a bad marriage just to fit in.

Not getting slapped and pushed around like a derelict keke by anyone.

Not putting up with misogyny.

Not trying to win the love of Nigerians.

Not trying.

Just living.

Living her best life.

Looking like a 21 year old.

I don't stan any Nigerian woman.

Not one.

But for Genny, I make an exception.

Unless Genny stops being Genny, we die here as fans.

I stan a queen. On her own lane. Not trying to be savage. Not trying to respond.

Not trying.

Just oozing class.

A goddess.
.
.

At a crucial time as this...

Remember you are in 2019, and you have a CHOICE.

You could be Genny...

But you are at the moment trying to impress a dude by using N2k to cook afang soup in his kitchen. With a stove. In a BQ.

You could be anything. 

But you chose that kind of life.

Live with it. Or treat yourself better.

Your choice.

Peace ✌#Rant1615
