So...

I went for a full medical examination today, courtesy of my new office in Ghana.

They've been spoiling me like crazy.

I saw the bill they paid and I gasped.

No wonder people don't go for full medical examination. The bill is staggering!

Work Permit is also costing the office a lot of money.

It's amazing how much value they place on me.

.

Anyway...

There was this medical examination I had to take that required I strip half-naked.

Tube-like instruments were placed on my chest and under my breasts.

When the doctor was done, she had to take my details to fill the medical report.

"How old are you?" She asked.

"I'll be 42 next month."

"You are beautiful," she said, matter-of-factly, as if she simply asked if I wanted a glass of water. 

"Thank you," I replied. 

We both smiled like teenagers.

It was a genuine appreciation of another woman from a professional of same gender who sees many naked people.

I blushed.

😊😊

PS: Today, I accomplished ten million things.

I love the life I choose to live ❤#Rant1628
