I just told someone who counted his "20 years experience as a creative director" as prerequisite to lead and be the last voice in the room that his experience doesn't count.

And I'll tell you why. 

Every era comes with its own needs. Its own method of communication. Its own madness. Its own lingo.

Experience, when it stands alone in the creative industry, does not hold water.

A bank manager with 20 years experience would mean something because figures don't change. 

1 + 1 will always be 2.

But social habits and attitudes change.

So an advertising director of 20 years will have to humble his knowledge to the language of the day.

The zeitgeist of this decade is an entire study. 

The best a 20-year experience will achieve on the table of creatives is to LISTEN to what drives new culture.

You have to know it, play around with it, then break it and defy it.

So yes, you get my "respect" as a creative for 20 years...

But I don't have to agree with your experience OR what your experience brings to the table. 

We all have experience. I've got 15 years behind me.

But what would it matter if I don't know how to marry that experience with today's culture.

Every real creative knows that a new era should be approached with new eyes.

Experience will count in the business of client service, but on the table of creativity...

We are all mad.
