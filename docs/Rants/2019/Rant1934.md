I'm getting calls again. 

And job offers.

Nigerians, why?

You are only going to employ me, pay me a fat salary and try to manipulate my power OR minimise my space because everything is uniformed and orthodox within a structure.

I understand that. But really, how do I fit in?

I don't!

And the fact that I'm getting all these calls AGAIN for something that is so easy to predict, makes me wonder.

What kind of thinking goes on in your companies?

I'm bored half the time.

You can't keep me for long. Trust me.

The brainstorming sessions will kill me for its lack of brain storm.

People will be uncomfortable with my ideas, et al.

Too much drama just to have me around.

And they'd hate that I earn more.

It has happened too many times.

Trust me, you can't afford to have me on your team.

Carry on with your usual projects and be pleased.

I will come in and shake things up and piss everyone off.

You don't need me.
.

I'm going to be on set for half of the year anyway, so where's the time for a nine-to-five?

Nollywood is my priority for 2020.

So, unless you are shooting a movie, series or staging a Play...

We have little in common in 2020.

Regards.
