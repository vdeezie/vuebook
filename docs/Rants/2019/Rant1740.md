Day 2 of the script hangout with Mary Njoku of Iroko TV and Uche Jombo.
.
.

We had breakfast buffet at Kempinski hotel.

Kempinski is a dream. It doesn't get more 5-star than this. 

I am always excited when I come here.

I went there for the first time in 2018 with The Boyfriend. We would wrap ourselves like kittens and sit by the pool area, sipping cocktail.

.

Mary, Uche and I spent the whole day there. 

Then we took a drive, did some shopping, and spent the evening at an amazing lounge with the most beautiful view...

All the while discussing more scenes and cliffhangers for the series.
.
.

It's been two days of great work and fun. 

Now it's time for this writer to script a brilliant series for her clients ðŸ˜Š
.
.

I've got so much work to do - 4 seasons to write for two different series on Iroko TV, and a day job in Advertising...

But I won't have it any other way.

This Art is enough. 

This life is deliberate.
