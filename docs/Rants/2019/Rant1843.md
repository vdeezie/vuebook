So I have over 50 people who are subscribed to my letters.

I send letters every Sunday to their emails. 

Today, I wrote about 'owning your peace'. 

Here's an excerpt of a longer letter sent to my subscribers.

I hope there'll allow me share a bit of what they pay for... to "bless" more people üòäüôè

Just an excerpt. 

If this resonates with your soul, then take it:
.

"I resigned last week from a new job I started in a new country. I had spent four months trying to understand how the structure will allow me live out my full potential/skill set. I stayed for four months hoping things will get better, they didn‚Äôt. The mediocrity became unbearable for my mental health. I was earning a lot of money ‚Äì probably the highest paying member of staff, but my mental health suffered. I was unhappy. So I resigned. And I remember walking out of the office on Friday with the wind blowing in my hair, and I wanted to fly. I was free. I had protected my mental health. I owned my Peace.

"This is how I respond ‚Äì I move. I am always on the move. I leave everything behind. Because if I die today, the world will move on. We are not as special as we think we are. Everything will continue as if you were never here.

"The job you have, the people in your life, the troubles you carry, everything will mean nothing when you are gone.

"And that is the horror and beauty of life.

"We are something, yet we are nothing."
