I was going to write a post about The Boyfriend paying school fees and buying new textbooks for a new session for my girls...

And I was going to end it with: "I don't deserve him."
.
.

But you know what?

Fvck that humility...

I deserve this man. 

I deserve love. I deserve kindness. I deserve to be pampered. I deserve the smile he puts on my face. I deserve his generosity. I deserve his patience, his support, his understanding. 

I deserve him.
.

And this life I have created for myself away from him...

I deserve it too!
.

I deserve all good things.

I deserve my boss.

I deserve writing for Iroko TV. 

I deserve smart daughters. 

I deserve the respect and reward I get for the value I bring. 
.
.

And you know what else I deserve?

That thing I am searching for that I don't know what it is...

When it finally comes in all its art and glory...

I will deserve it, too.

Yup.
