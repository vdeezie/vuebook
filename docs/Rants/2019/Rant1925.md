This time last week...

We were getting ready for my mum's 70th partee. 
.

I had picked the girls from school a day before.

We went shopping because their pajamas and underwear had to be replaced! Everything was old and worn! 

(PS: Boarding school and underwear. Na wa! I change their pants every term. And I buy a pack of 12 each.)

We spent the whole day shopping.

Then we went back to the hotel. Had dinner.

Next day (partee day), their hair had to be fixed.

Jolly got a nice hair cut.

Ife got a perm.
.

When they were done, I had only 45 minutes to get everyone ready.

I dropped them at mum's. They had their party clothes there. I headed to Golden Tulip to book for the night.

Golden Tulip made me waste 20 minutes, waiting for a porter to take me to my room!

I was out of time, so I borrowed 10 minutes from partee hour to get my make up done.

Whew.
.
.

I sent a picture to The Boyfriend. 

"No makeup?"

"I have makeup on."

"But, apart from the lipstick, this is how you look when you wake up in the morning."

"Niggaa, are you horny?"

"Fuck you! I'm in love."

"Eyaah!" I teased.

😂😂😂
.

When the call ended he sent a text.

"You are so beautiful. So fierce. So brilliant. Like a best kept secret."
.

Aww. He's horny for real.
