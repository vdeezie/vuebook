I'm going to write a most controversial love story someday for big screen. Just so I can mess with this silly idea that love should be easy and sweet and cute, only then can it be considered wholesome. 

Sometimes love is tough. It is painful. It clashes with your best judgment. It overwhelms. It throws you off balance. 

Sometimes love is chaos.

Beautiful chaos. 

Excitement. Fire. Exhausting. 

Love as candy. Or love as alcohol. 

Why would anyone go for candy?

Get drunk in love. 

Live, abeg.

Set your soul on fire. Lose yourself. 

Love like a morrafucka.

Write your own authentic story of love.

I like breathless love. 

A little bit of desperation. 

A little bit of losing self. 
.

But we all have become characters in Nollywood...

Always telling people that love is not love until the one you love feels like a sibling... ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

You know, let's share-a-pack-of-cookies kinda love. 

No, please. I'm an adult.
