When a white man makes money...

He goes into his society and finds solution to a problem - e.g: purifies water in parts of society, so children and families do not die.
.
.

When a Nigerian makes money...

He comes on social media and brags about his perceived wealth...

Then he challenges those who need purified water to sign up for his Masterclass so they can provide their own potable water.

🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

.

The white man's money changes the world. 

The black man's money torments everyone except his immediate family.

And this is why African witchcraft does not want your progress.

- Because your wealth and progress ain't shit.
.

The white man's wizardry, on the other hand, continues to build a more sophisticated world.
