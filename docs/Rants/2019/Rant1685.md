The "justice" we demand, sometimes, for an offence or a crime, irks.

It's been this way since I was little. And even as a child, I always wondered...

Is that it? 

Is this the justice we will get for this action or crime?

When a pastor rapes a member - whether a child or an adult - the consequence should not be "stepping down from the pulpit".

People would say it is the first step to justice. 

This is Africa. It is the first step to nothing.

And if I place no value on a pulpit, then it means no kind of justice has taken place.
.

It's the same result for a cousin who rapes a cousin...

The rapist is sent out of the home of the victim. That's all.

If a teacher rapes a minor, the school sacks the rapist. That's all.

If a mechanic rapes a child, they close his workshop.

A father rapes his child... he is told to buy a goat and cleanse the land.

The fvck!!!

This perversion of justice is what we live by.

Some victims of rape are satisfied with an apology. 

I can never understand it.

Rapists belong in jail.

Say that one hundred times!

They belong in jail and nowhere else.

Buying of goat, apologising, repentance and stepping down is not what society should be after.

Fatoyinbo stepping down from a pulpit, for instance, serves no purpose in the broader picture of justice. 

Niggaa still has access to women - probably more than before. He just gathered more sympathisers for that action.
.

The one that really gets my goat is when we seek repentance from rapists.

A penis holds no regret.

The entire exercise of trying to work out a conscience for someone who enjoys breaking women emotionally and sexually is a waste of time.

A twisted psychological makeup is like a drug. It's what turns them on.

That psychological makeup harms others... that is why they need to be far away from others as possible - behind bars.

Whew.
.

A senator beats up a sales girl, and the average Nigerian only wants him to apologise.

You shout and shout and shout for days on social media only to ask for an apology?!

No real justice for the girl at the end of our performance. 
.

A man abandons his children...

All we want is a statement on social media to assure us that he loves them, with pictures he took with them when they were born hundred years ago 

And for good entertainment, he can add that the mother makes it haaaaaard for him to spend time with the kids. And everybody will be mushy.

Aww... *sniff *sniff.

It's terrible occupation to seek justice from the African public and system.
.

A victim of domestic abuse is badgered to forgive her spouse...

And the consequence for beating a spouse is usually an apology to her family. 

That's all.

A sick sick society. 
.

If we need to cleanse the society, we don't need to raise our hands to heaven in prayer.

You do that every Sunday and Wednesday.

God is not deaf.

Cleanse the society by putting criminals in jail.

Stop negotiating punishment with rapists, abusers and offenders.

And any society where the police is uneducated, poor, helpless and created to protect the rich and powerful above everyone else is not a society to raise children.

It is not a society that will keep you safe.#Rant1685
