One of my quiet friends online is gradually trying to become a bad bitch...

And I am always present to click the love reaction when she posts new pictures.

Rebellion is always a lonely road.

She needs all the support she can get.

I mean... she still wears shuku and applies white powder...

But I will not miss this journey for anything!

I want to be there when she begins to apply lipstick, tweeze her brows, find her shade of foundation, and try on some jewellery.

I want to be there to click a big red love reaction to all the pictures. 
.

I don't know what exactly she is rebelling against at the moment...

But I love to see her attempts at annoying society. 

My love reaction is always ready!

I am here for all of it! üòç
