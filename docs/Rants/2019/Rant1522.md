Today was one of those really special days.

After my radio show, I was surprised to find 'the boyfriend' waiting for me at the car park at TAAC.

He doesn't come to TAAC. Ever. 
(Long story. It's a male ego thing and it's none of my business) 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

It's raining heavily and we are smiling through our car glasses.

I make a gesture that says - "why are you here?"

He calls my phone, still looking through the car window, and smiling at me.

"You have some appointments you mentioned the other day? I'm here to take you there."

I am smiling because I am happy and surprised. He is here to take me to all my appointments for the day.

"Thanks," I say.

"You have an umbrella?"

"No. I'll use my shawl. It's thick."

"It'll ruin your hair," he says.

"No. It's the winter shawl you bought for me in London. It's very thick."

I wave the grey shawl through my car window for him to see.

He shakes his head and says...

"It'll ruin your hair."

I watch this man enter the pouring rain. Go to his booth. Bring out an umbrella and come to my car to shield me as I step out.

He was dripping of water!

"You are crazy," I laugh.

"I know," he smiles.

He took me to all my appointments today.

I saw my optometrist for check up. 
He waited.
(*PS: still glaucoma free. Yay!)

I had meetings with advertisers for Island Weekly. 
He waited.

I had a meeting with a company looking at collaborating with TAAC for unconventional classes for their millennial staff. 
He waited.

After my appointments, he got me lunch and brought me back to the office.

At the gate, he had a gift for me in the backseat.

"I saw what you wrote the other day. Reading it carried more weight than actually saying it. And I want you to know I didn't mean it to sound so mean. I don't think there's anything wrong with being Alone. You are a beautiful, strong, and very smart woman. The very best of the stock. That's why I am here, still shamelessly pursuing you," he said.

"It is OK  to choose to be alone," he continued, "It's OK to protect your personal space. It is OK to embrace aloneness. It's a very strong position and I admire it."

I smiled, "Thank you."

Then he got cheeky. 

"But on the other part, I'm right," he said. "You don't give a f*ck about your Ex. You just like how ridiculously shallow that relationship was. You don't want the dude. You just want to keep believing you want him because it was a convenient non-committal zero-class option."

😳😳🙄🙄🙄😳😳😳

Yup! He managed to drag that entire relationship through the mud.

"My darling, you'll be alright las' las'" I rolled my eyes.

He hugged me and I alighted. 

It was a perfect afternoon.

And I told him so.

"I want to take a long drive to nowhere," I said as he took me from one appointment to the other. "A long drive with good music."

"You will take all the drives you want in this life. I guarantee you," he said.

Sigh! 😊😊❤❤
