Think about it....

You were on your own as a non-existent element...

Then sex happened somewhere, and you were told to run.

You weren't actually told, but there are 30 million of your kind, and they are all running towards a direction... so you do the logical thing - you run.

"What are we running away from?" You ask another spermatozoon.

"Not from. We are running towards something."

"What?" You ask as you keep running, panting. 

"An ovum."

Whatever the fvck that is, you don't know. 

"They say it is the beginning of something great for the lucky spermatozoon that hits the ovum. Run!" Another one bumps into the conversation. 

So you run. You run because, well, running is what is expected of you.

(Un)fortunately, you hit the ovum. And you watch as all the others die.

You are still confused oh. It still doesn't make sense.

Now you live in a sac called the uterus. 

You are growing into something you can barely recognise, something you had no permission to become. 

You are now a zygote. Then an embryo after fertilization. 

You are fed with stuff you don't like. You hear voices from someplace you can't trace. Language you can't comprehend. 

In all of this, you have had no say in this - if you want this.

Time passes. 

You are instructed to GET OUT of the uterus that you have found some comfort in.

"Get out of me!" You hear.
"Puuuuuuush!" You hear.

Your head pops out of a vagina.

You are born. 
Faces everywhere. 

You have a mother. You have a father. And siblings.

You didn't choose these people. You had no say in this arrangement. 

Something called the "weather" is killing you. 

The smell called life. The discomfort. 

You are clearly irritated. You are angry even. 

You are now on earth. 

You are a human being. 

No permission was sought from you. Nothing. 
.

Now the real uncertainty begins. 

Then comes the rules and norms everywhere you turn. 

Acceptability, likeability and conformity gagging you.

You are told to hustle. 

Something called Currency defines you.

An institution called Marriage is supposed to make you happy.

Life unravels in front of you.

You see death. 
You see broken dreams.
You witness injustice. 
You know corruption. 

You've seen people struggle for naught.
You know love.
You see pain.
You watch the abuse of others.

You are forced to be educated to get ahead.
You are told to have children to feel complete.

You buy a car. Buy a house. Buy a boat.

You are a moving machine. 
.

You have not stopped to ask, Why? 

Because "Why" changes everything. 

Infact, you are forbidden to ask, "Why?"

"Why" makes you a rebel. And nobody wants to deal with rebellion.

You serve a religion without question. 
You procreate without sense.
You work so hard for no genuine reason.

You didn't ask to be born, YET you have to live with all these rules. Attain all this rubbish called "Achievements".

But nobody asked you if you even want to be here!

You are a prisoner. 
.
And when you are tired of this prison and you want it all to end...

They tell you (that) you have no right to leave.

Hian!

Your own life is not yours. It belongs to everyone except you. 
.
.

I am not endorsing suicide, I am just amused that people are shocked some people want to take their lives. 

This is so easy to understand. 

If you have figured how to live and prosper in a prison, it doesn't mean everyone else has or wants to.

By all means stop people from committing suicide, but at least, understand how life works like a prison.

If you understand that then you can show empathy. 

I totally understand why someone would want to leave the earth. It's not so hard to comprehend. Use your imagination. 

A student kills himself for failing his exams.

Why?

Because the pressure to succeed is silly!

That's the answer. 
.

So what's the solution?

To survive this world, I will ask that you rise above everything - the pressure, the rules, and instructions.

If you are able to rise above "this-is-how-we-do-it"... you have won in this life, no matter how little you may have.

True freedom is in the mind.

Forget the situation, the pressure, the silly comparison...

Deal with your MIND.

That's your true wealth, your freedom.
.

May the souls of the dead rest.

May the rest of us find a way.#Rant1636
