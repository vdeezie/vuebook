Meanwhile The Boyfriend is using my name to get cheques oo!

He went for a meeting in South Africa, during the hour, one of the women said she reads a "popular Nigerian" on Facebook.

He smiled and said, "Joy Isi Bewaji, right?"

"Ah yes! She's so much trouble, it's refreshing," the woman said.

Then he racked his brain... should I tell her, should I not? Joy will kill me if I do... Fuck it! This is business, and name-dropping works magic sometimes ðŸ˜‚

So he said...

"I'm the boyfriend."

And he said he thought she was about to have a heart attack oo! Her eyes grew bigger and brighter and she held her breath for many seconds!

'Oh my goodness!!!" She said.

They talked about some of my posts. 

Bottom line: He got the business.

I have told him to send my tithe - thirty percent. He is telling me he will put it in the children's account.

Is it their names he used to seal the deal?

Shior!

Niggaa, better have my money! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’…ðŸ’…
