So my new friend at work hooked me up with her friend on WhatsApp. 

He's hot. I can't lie.

So the guy was like... "Picture. Send her picture."

My friend told me, and I was rolling my eyes...

"Picture. Picture. Picture. See how he is shouting everywhere! If I send picture, can he handle it? Can he?" I hissed. 

So I sent my pictures. 

Now niggaa is sending lovestruck emojis everywhere.

OK.

Shebi I have passed his test?

Oya, let my own test begin...

Do you have sense?
Do you know how to love a woman?
Can you keep me excited?
Are you romantic?
Can you love a woman like me and not feel intimidated?
Can you keep up with my energy?
Can you make this work?

Olodo.

Picture. Picture. Picture. 

Shior.
