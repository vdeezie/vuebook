# Rant1620


May 7, 2019

This is the kind of rant that would easily be misunderstood.

But do I care? 🤷🏽‍♀️
.

We won't stop making money. No, we won't. 

I did not use saliva to pay rent from Lekki to Accra. Money exchanged hands.

I asked my travel agent if I could use oxygen to pay for me and my manager's flight ticket. She said NO.

So I paid with cash.
.

I get it, money is important.

But by jove! The obsession is something I do not want to be part of.

I don't want to talk about it so banally.

This societal pressure is beneath me.

Yes, I am placing that blantant, almost offensive, money yap beneath me.
.

The question is: what else is there to talk about that carries as much value as money?

I don't know, but I will find it.

PS: Feel free to turn this simple rant on top of its head.
