OMG!

I just watched a video of a Babcock couple having sex, recording the shit and swallowing c.u.m.

What is going on?

It’s not just the sex that shocks me, it’s the attention to detail - trying to perfect a pornhub scenario.

She sucked in all the cum.

This cannot be cool.

And this is happening in your cherished private institutions that, you know, deny your children phones and internet, monitoring their every move as if they’ll get lost in full sight.

Imagine what then happens in public universities.

If lecturers are not raping students, these students are willingly getting their asses on video whilst having sex.

That video is messy. It is somewhere on Twitter, find it yourself.

You do not want to be the parent with the dumbest child in the pack with no sense of discretion.

This is why we need to have these conversations with our children consistently.
.

And it also brings me to the constant mental drill on what to do when my daughters graduate from secondary school.

I do not think sending a young teenage girl to a university is a good idea in today’s world. I am not being a prude, I’m just not convinced there are more merits than demerits for a young teen in a higher institution.

That chick, for instance, is having sex and sucking cum. She cannot be of much value to herself and her primary ambition in school, which is to learn.

Why?

She is going to get all wrapped up in thoughts of affection. She’s going to spend her years in school catching feelings, seeking approval and validation from this boy she is sleeping with.

They may not even last a semester. However, since she has started having sex, someone else would have to fill the gap. 

She's going to always want approval from any guy to love her after swallowing his stuff.

And that goes for him too. But, you see, he is not the one in focus right now because dude was smart enough to ensure his face did not appear fully in the video. The girl, however, was pouting at the camera and acting like a sex vixen.

She thinks she is hot. She thinks he will stay. She thinks sex will keep him. She thinks sucking cum will make him treasure her. Somewhere in all of this, she thinks she is special and this thing they are doing will strengthen their bond.

She's a kid. She knows nothing.

Phew.

Please have the sex conversation with your children, abeg!

After secondary school is when parents need to spend more time educating their teenagers. They are young adults now, the protection of secondary school is gone, they need you to give information on just about everything – not in a condescending manner, but as a guiding light.

The do-as-I-say will not work. You will have to provide all the necessary information and guidance necessary. 

These teenagers need us!

Do not just approach their lives the way our parents approached ours. Things have changed.
.

I don’t know why that video got to me the way it did. I think it did because it was the first thing I saw this morning. It’s fvcked up.

She cannot handle the pressure of living up to a sex life and academic pursuit.

She’s too young to get the full understanding of how fvcked up this is.

Even old women are still getting fvcked up by their interpretation of affection, how much more a teenager.

I don’t know mehn! Tertiary institution for 15 and 16 year olds is just not something I endorse.

Life is not what it used to be. The internet changes everything.
.

I don’t have a solid plan yet for my girls, but I know I have to be deliberate, not conforming.

Teen girls need to be closer to home after secondary school with monitored influences, and the chance to be told what to focus on.

They need to be guided.

I don’t know. I don’t know.

I’m confused, and that’s an emotion I don’t usually accept.#Rant1889
