The Boyfriend asked if I miss my life in Lekki.

Nah mehn!

I was legit using pure water to wash my armpit, under my bust and lady parts in Lekki Phase 1 after a shower every morning and night!

Even my face! I wouldn't let that Lekki water touch my face.

Whew!

You will shower, then you will have to re-shower delicate parts with pure water, else the discomfort of bad water on your skin will leave you miserable.

I had so many bags of water by the side of my bathroom, it was insane - the space it occupied in a studio apartment. It could pass for a pure water depot. 

If I had enough space, I would have built those pure water bags a cage. Lol!

I never had to do that living on the mainland.

I couldn't believe water could actually be so tough and dirty coming out from a tap, even after proper purification.

Lekki is a disgrace.

The terrible stench. The flood. The one million generators and air pollution fronting as oxygen. The bad water. The dirty gutters. The zero security.

Bougie never looked so pretentious.

Lekki remains the biggest scam.
