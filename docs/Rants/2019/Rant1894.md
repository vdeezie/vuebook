1.
When it is "your time", your PLAGIARISM will be applauded and described as "soothing remix", "reviving old songs". 
.

2.
When it is "your time", your crime (e.g: drug trafficking) will be described by your desperate friends as a simple matter, "after all, she did not kill anybody".
.

3.
When it is "your time", your scam will make you rich. You will feed people with sand - well packaged sand, and promote it as a cure for ulcer. 

People will buy, die and still come back from the grave to buy more to kill their cousins and nieces. 
.
.

When people desperately overlook your crime...

Know that it is "your time".

Praaaaaaaaaaise the Nigerian Gawd!
