You marry for "love".

Regina Daniels marries for money.

What makes your motivation for marriage better than hers?

What justifies your reason to be with someone above someone else's.

This social construct eating at the edges of your brain is a problem.

May I remind you that you - a Nigerian - do not yet have potable water in a world where Artificial Intelligence is a thing.

You do not have the basics to qualify as a human being in the 21st century.

You are at the very bottom of the value chain.

All of you!

Why don't you worry about that and leave people to marry for whatever reasons that please them?

Why don't you focus on your national lack and economic disgrace?

And if that is far-fetched, how about you focus on your personal lack  - or something.

You are third world....

Your old is eating every naira they can lay their hands on in the corridors of power.

Your xennials are obsessed with weddings.

Your millennials are faffing around social media, contributing nada to the conversation the world is having.

Yet you focus on Regina Daniels and her LEGIT choices.

You go to her mother's page and call her a prostitute.

You people are animals!
.

Regina is an adult. She is entitled to make decisions however it pleases her.

You want her to be ashamed she married an older man for money?

What validates the story of those who marry younger men for love?

What?

Look around you... around the marriages you know and tell me what makes this social construct acceptable.

Smh.

Go and pull the rope of your generator, you hear?

Nepa has "taken" your light.#Rant1608
