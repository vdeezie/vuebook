"I am rich. I can gather 8,000 people in a room for a free conference. Watch me strut to the podium in my Balenciaga." - Nigerian Rich
.

Nigerian interpretation: Successful event.
.

Rich person's reward: 

1. Some kind of popularity.

2. More fair-weather friends.

3. 900,000 direct messages.

4. Wake up the next morning feeling like king/queen.

5. Many authentic small/medium scale business owners sending friend requests and dropping constant oohs and aahs on dry as fack posts just to find favour. Smh.
.

Rich person's ambition:

Get a bigger team to do a bigger conference next year. This time somebody is going to win a car.

You win a car! You win a car!! Everybody wins a caaaaar!!!

Look under your seats for car keeeeys!!!

We are so easily carried away by nothing. 

Even if you receive handouts from them...

Ask deeper questions. Demand better strategies. Expect creative excellence.

Don't take your t.o.n.g.u.e too deep into that a.s.s.
