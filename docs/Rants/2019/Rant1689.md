I blocked only one person in this season of 'Rape and Apologists'.

He wrote...

"This is the most funniest thing I have heard. How can you say they raped you and you didn't even scream?"

I scrolled past the post...

But then I scrolled back.

"Most funniest".

At least if you are going to be a bastard, write good sentences.

Niggaa can't even write. Yet he wants to have an opinion about rape.

I don't deserve to have an idiot in my space. 

I work too hard and I read a lot. I deserve better from people around me.

So I blocked him.

During the day he is a keyboardist at a church... for the rest of his life, he operates like an idiot.

I hate stupid men.

I hate stupid men who feel entitled.

Someone should tell some of these men that they are nothing without patriarchy.

Meet someone like me on a level-playing intellectual field and I will kick your ass.

All they have is a big head, patriarchy and a penis... 

And a big mouth where they spew rubbish.

These are your husbands. 

These are the men daring you to stay single and be "miserable".

And you choose them over staying single, fulfilled and happy.

These dullards. These animals.

PS:
The remaining 283 people I blocked recently are not Nigerians and not related to rape.

I am determined to have a peaceful life in Ghana all by myself... until excitement comes along.

I create my reality.

Regards.
