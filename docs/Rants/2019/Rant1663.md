The 'Intelligent" on social media constantly trolls the 'unintelligent"...

Bhet the 'Intelligent" is angry as fvck when we troll his/her "poverty".

The "Intelligent" reminds us that we are not the ones feeding him/her.

They defend their right to be financially - um - unfit.

But they will not let the "unintelligent" drink water in peace. 

It is OK to troll people for not getting their tenses and comma and paragraphs right...

But it is not OK to troll your broke ass?

You think correct grammar excludes you from "insort"?

LMAO!!!

You people ehn!
.

Bitch/Niggaa, you are persistently broke like the rest of us are persistently "unintelligent".

I think that's fair, as far as trolling goes. 

Deal with it the way the "unintelligent" deals with your constant trollling.

Nobody ever ate a semicolon for breakfast.
