This rant is titled: Lovers' Conversation.

Yesterday, The Boyfriend dragged me to Four Points hotel.

He says he can't stay at Oriental hotel. He says it is razz.

Jehovah! MY favourite hotel!
.

I had to remind him of a few things...

1. 
Four Points has a razz view - in short it has no view! You'll be staring at the side of another building! Ugh!

Oriental overlooks the ocean on one side, and the bright lights of Victoria Island on the other side. Beautiful! 😊
.

2. 
The air conditioner in Four Points room is loud.

Oriental hotel only has a soft hum to its a/c 🤷🏾‍♀️
.

3. 
Oriental hotel has a fridge packed with drinks - all FREE.

Four Points has basic stuff in the fridge for sale.
.

4. 
Housekeeping is always on time at Oriental.

I can't say the same for Four Points.
.

5. 
Room service at Oriental hotel: Ah! Order food in your room and you will need to call all your friends from far and near to help you finish food oo!
Soups and stews for one person will feed a village!

Four Points? Small quantity tinz.

😂😂
.
.

What he hates is any hotel that has a banquet hall and is opened for events.

Because it allows just anybody to walk into the hotel.

But at Four Points, you can't take the lift higher than the second floor without an access card.

Four Points is chic, private, special.

Oriental is for family. Sometimes it feels like an apartment building. LMAO!

He can't stand it, but I love it! 😂😂
.
.

Whilst cuddling, we talked about vacation plans for 2020.

I say I want to visit Mauritius and Dubai amongst other places.

He apologised for not being available for Mauritius this year. He says we will definitely go to Mauritius...

But he says he hates Dubai. And he doesn't want to go.

"You can go with the kids, but you and I will do other places."

Hian! 

"Why?" I ask.

"Dubai is for wannabes," he says.

Hei God! This man!!! Gbas gbos everywhere! 😂😂

"But you lived there for two years," I laugh.

"Yes. So I should know."
.

Na wa! Wahala man! 

I told him we must go together.

Of course, I won eventually 😁💃
.
.

I miss him already. Sigh 😂😭

PS: Peep the lovely view from my Oriental hotel room (see pictures)...

My view from Four Points, however, was the roof of a small building beside it. Not even worthy of a picture 😂

Oriental - razz and all: 1

Four Points - bougie and all: 0

😛😛😅
