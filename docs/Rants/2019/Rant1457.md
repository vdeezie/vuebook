Why do we have such poor romantic culture?

Why are Nigerian men always in a hurry?

Why are poems not a thing?

Why isn't soft music a thing?

Why can't you just relax, bury your legs in the beach sand and just relax!

Why don't you put your back on the back-rest of the car and just exhale.

Why do you rush the glass of wine?

Why do we need to rush home? (Unless we are rushing to have sex, then I get it).

Why can't we just be still, let our energy do some magic to us.

Why can't we take the long drive and not stop?

Why can't you stop being anxious about the flight?

Why can't you just put your head on my lap and let go?

Why can't men just relax?

You have just this moment. 

Just. This. Moment.

Hold my hand, and let's take a walk.

Breathe.

It's just this one life.
.

This is why women with a certain level of depth choose to be alone.
