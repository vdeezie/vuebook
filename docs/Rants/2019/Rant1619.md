If you have any type of understanding how the world works...

You'll acknowledge the vileness of Cersei and leave her alone, nip her in the bud, OR fight to win. 

I sincerely don't have a problem with her.

She is actually quite straightforward about who she is.

The problem is other people. They expect her to change. 

It's the silliest thing.

And it shows an appalling weakness of every character that has some kind of relationship with her - family, workers, subjects etc.

They are the problem. 

Cersei is not.

Everybody and their sense of morality have been rotating, too many times, around a desperate need to change the woman. 

No. She is not going to change.

Trying to talk to her conscience is stupid. 

And that is how we arrived at this juncture where she still wields so much fear and power - some qualities for a leader. 
.

I mean, you gotta give it to Cersei...

She was eating jollof rice and drinking wine in her province, while others were fighting the dead...

Only for her to show up after the war, and kills a dragon and the black chick.

That's brilliant.
.

In a nutshell, think Capitalism. 

I will pick her over Daenerys.

That one needs to go and get married and cook egusi soup - or som'tin ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
