Letting go of my Festac apartment today. 

My mum is there. 
Roberta is there. 
My generator man is there to carry my generator as a gift (mum says no way. Lol!). 
Caretaker is there to pick up the keys.

I'm far away from that location. 

Just finished Sexual Capital (offline class) at Write Culture office, Victoria Island. 

Now I head to a hotel for some Saturday healing.
.

Goodbye to Festac.

I lived a full experience. 

It is time to really move on.
