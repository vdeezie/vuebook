You people never learn.

Stop marrying beneath you.

Stop dating down.

You won't hear!

There's no virtue to it.

It is stupid. It is dense.

Stop legitimizing stupidity.

Stop eating shit from the sewer when you should be having a three course meal.

Demand more from yourself.

And if no one can meet you on the level you want...

Then do this life on your own.

Stop bending. Stop breaking. Stop compromising. 

These people ain't worth it. 99% of people hovering around your space ain't worth the sacrifice.

They ain't shit. 

Create your happiness. Create your life.

I'm not going to sound a cliche and say, "Love yourself", because that's a given.

What you must do is stan who you are.

Be the best at every chance you have - best mother, best writer, best content creator, best lover, best friend, best employee, best boss, best entrepreneur. 

Beat your own record every day.

Find the love that will fucking worship you... and vice versa.

Stop settling.

You have one life, damn it!

Averageness sucks, by jove!

I hate mediocrity! Hate it in career, hate it in business...

But most of all, I hate it in personal branding!

Do one thing every morning: Wish yourself the best. 

And put in the work to be your best.

Whew!
