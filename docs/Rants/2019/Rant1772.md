This time last year.

The Boyfriend asked...

"What plans do you have for the girls this holiday?"

"Nothing yet."

"Then they should go to Dubai," he said.

Just like that!
.

He bought three tickets on Emirates... Paid for two weeks in a 4-star hotel in Dubai...

He gave us pocket money - one bundle for food, another bundle for shopping, one bundle for adventure, and a spare bundle for any "random expensive craving".

Two weeks later, I took the kids to Dubai.

It was their first time, sponsored by this MAN.
.
.

I have seen love in its purest form.

Non-judgmental, kind, patient, trusting.

The Boyfriend is my best love story.

Yet I refuse to own it.

Everyday I let it fly away.

And everyday it comes back to me.

No pressure. No promises. No tomorrow.

Just today. 

How can you love me today? 

Show it.

That's freedom. 

It has given me more than any conventional path I have ever taken.
