How girls/women still go to open concerts in Nigeria, baffles me.

You read tweets like, "leave your pri.vate part at home"...

Yet you will wear your shorts and t-shirt and go listen to a song you've played all year on spotify.

In a country that guarantees no security. None whatsoever. 

Your security is your cousin who may get drunk and not be equipped to defend you.

You are not only vulnerable to random concert-goers and louts, you are also exposed to being harmed by the force sworn to protect you.

The Nigerian Police is not even on your side.

If anything happens, they'll blame your bum shorts and the colour of your lipstick.
.

This level of dogged determination would do well in other areas of your life.

This kind of risk and dare should be reserved for the goals you hope to achieve in 2020.

Not for open concerts.

Be intentional about your safety, biko.
