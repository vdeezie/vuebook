Spent the entire day with the girls. 

Picked them from school. Brought tshirts and sneakers for them to wear. Then off we went to the cinema to watch a movie.

Then lunch. Then ice cream. Then shopping.

Then conversation. 

Halfway through my talk, Ife looks at me as if staring at the sun. 

"You sound like Thanos," she says.

Yooooo!!! 😂😂😂

"Is that a compliment?" I ask. 
Then I stick my tongue out, "Fvck it, I'm taking it as a compliment."

We all laugh.

"Oh mummy. I like you a lot," Ife says, tears in her eyes (very emotional pikin 🤷🏽‍♀️).

I smile and hold her hand.

"I like you too, Ife."

And I pull Jolly's cheek. 

"And you too, Jo-Jo."

It was a great day.
