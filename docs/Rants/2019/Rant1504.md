It was a great week!

Nzuri got so much love and patronage. 

*Shout out to my Nzuri lovers!!! You know what's good for your skin! *muaaaah!

We had more male patronage for Nzuri this week. No surprises there! Valentine's Day, baby! üòç

Thank you! I'm sure your women loved their packages.

Call us back and order yours too.

You deserve skin free of toxin üòä

My upcoming book has sold 50 copies. 

Thanks y'all!

I will autrograph 100 copies for the first 100 buyers!

Be one of the 100. 

It's funny, it's cheeky, loaded with sarcasm, and a dose of raw truth. You'll love it!

It will be out in a fortnight. Yay!

Well, I did get Ads before our first print.

As we circulate around the Island next week, we shall have the e-copy on our Instagram page.
