This life ehn!

So I went jogging this morning... because that's how starz do.

A car nearly hit me on a road as wide as a South African belle's ass.

Niggaa was trying to swerve across my path in a hurry to work - or wherever. 

A wide road, no traffic -  nothing!

Yet he felt like killin' someone this morning. 

It all lasted for two seconds, but I was shaken. 
.

And I'm here thinking...

My current need to jog is to get a fitter body for sex... because sex is more graceful when you're svelte. 
(PS: who, in their right minds, think of "sex" and "graceful" in the same sentence though?! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
.

Anyway, what was I saying...

Yes, trying to achieve a slender frame for the benefit of sex...

Imagine losing your life for trying to stay fit when you could be eating an entire pizza and a bowl of ice cream and be fat and alive?

This life is all kinds of flatulent beans, I tell you.

Good day. 

Stay alive.
