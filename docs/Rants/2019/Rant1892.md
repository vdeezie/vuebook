It's funny how I was working so hard in Lagos running small businesses...

Yet I did not make the kind of earnings I make chilling in Accra with 0% stress writing scripts.

Smart work is not a myth.

It is, by far, greater than hard work. 

In Lagos, I was always emotionally drained, always tired, always trying... it was rewarding but nothing close to the ease and peace of where I am now.

You have electricity and you have potable water... and your clients are one WhatsApp message or call away.

Transfers are made. You deliver excellent scripts on time because you don't have to go pull a generator 10 times a day. You don't have to deal with the angst of living in Nigeria.

You don't have to be so angry all the time!

You sleep long and well, and take power naps during the day.

You eat. Watch Netflix. Drink what you like. Spread yourself all over your beautiful apartment.

You are not in Lagos.

You finally have control over the quality of life you desire.

You are writing, and it is making sense. And you're getting paid.

Take charge of your life.

That's the post.
