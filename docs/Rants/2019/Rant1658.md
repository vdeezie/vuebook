Year in, year out. 

Decades come, decades go...

Why do women still need to kneel down to feed a husband at their wedding ceremony?

Why?

If it made sense in 2001...

It sure as hell doesn't make sense in 2019.

Think about it...

Why are you, as an adult, kneeling to stuff cake into the mouth of another adult on the day that culture and social constructionism state as your happiest day?

Does your "happy day" require you to appear or become inferior?
.

Why the fvck should any of my daughters kneel down before, on or after a wedding ceremony to another human being?

Why?

Don't we ever take the time from our collective averageness as Africans to question these things?
.

Again I ask...

Why the fvck are you kneeling down on your wedding day?

It is the endorsement to your inferiority - that entire "head and neck" formula bullshit.

Who the fvck wants to be the neck of a man?!

Women say things like...

"When you submit, you stylishly control him."

Your ambition is to control a man - many of them average as a flipping coin!

By jove!

It makes no sense at all in 2019 that YOU haven't questioned this practice and other such unwholesome shenanigans. 

Makes no sense
