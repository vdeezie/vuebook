My boss has a low-pitched voice, but he has a good sense of humour...

So when he invites me to his office for a crack of his jokes, and I start lauging like a typical loud Nigerian woman...

It will seem like I am the only one talking and laughing to myself.

Nobody in the other offices will hear his voice... but my laughter kicks off like a bad generator in Oshodi and climaxes like thunder.

But he is the cause of it.

Even his laughter is quiet. You see, he leaves no evidence.

So when you walk into his office, you will find me holding on to the edge of laughter... and you will see him sitting there innocently acting like he is talking about climate change.

You may be tempted to conclude that Nigerian women are loud and Ghanaian men are quiet.

Which is, of course, not true 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ 💅💅
