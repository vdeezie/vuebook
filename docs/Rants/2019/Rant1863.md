My day in a post:

I woke up by 7am.

I wrote an episode of a series. 25 pages.

I wrote 'Letters from Joy' to my subscribers.

I took a shower. Ate fries and eggs with mango juice.

I travelled around social media. Read a piece on newyorker.

I watched three episodes of The Fixer. I‚Äôm in S4 E22.

My data finished halfway. I don‚Äôt have mobile money on my phone, so I sent Emilia a message to pay my data (thanks, honey). 
I bought 550 ghs on my MTN modem. Phew. I spend too much money on data.

I wrote another episode of the series. Another 25 pages.

I listened to my favourite melancholy songs from Meadows to Rosemary & Garlic.

I called my kids.

Now I‚Äôm going to take a shower, eat some chicken, and watch Money Heist.

No pressure.

As you enter a new week, remember you are not in a race with anyone. It is the most insulting thing anyone can tell you. Do not put yourself in a position to be an imposter, to feed off people‚Äôs applause. The same hands they employ to clap for you will be used to slap you.

I thought we all knew this already?

Don‚Äôt chase clout. It is a mirage.

Everything you think is, is not.

Respect yourself enough not to be a hypocrite.

Live your own life.

Embrace your small dreams.

You are doing just fine.

Have a brilliant week.
