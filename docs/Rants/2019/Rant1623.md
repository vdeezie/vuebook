#GhanaChronicles 07

First meal I am making in over a year and a half.

It had to be the simplest thing I could whip, of course it had to be noodles ðŸ˜‚

I don't miss cooking. 

I don't miss anything.

I got home after a long-ass meeting last year and pulled out my gas hose. A gas cooker I hadn't used since I bought it.

Some things are needless.

Cooking is one of them for me.

Nobody pays me to cook. It makes me zero money. I get zero satisfaction from it.

Social constructionism tells us women should love cooking... as if there's a special hormone that triggers a love for cooking.

I am not a chef.

Yet cooking takes so much time.

Makes no sense to me to spend time to feed a stomach like a shrine. Especially as I live alone.

Food is good but it's not that deep. 

But there's this fine-ass electric hob in this Ghana apartment anyway... and I had to pull some basic culinary stunt ðŸ˜›
.

PS: Yes, noodles with french roll is delicious ðŸ˜‹
