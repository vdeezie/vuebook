The more they push this marriage narrative, the more ridiculous it sounds. 

Your cousin quit her N300k job for a N80k job just so her insecure-as-fvck husband can earn N300k and she can earn N120k.

In total they earn N420k. That's it. That's the dream. 

And you are happy sharing this tragedy?

Adults trying to make us believe in compromise as the sweetener in marriage by sharing this appalling story of lack.

Don't you people have any shame?

Is this story meant to inspire people who sell buns in traffic? Because it is definitely not for middle-class women.

As single women, WE EARN MORE!!! Way more than your salaries put together. 

Think of something else.

Now take your marriage and use it to pack shit in Oworonshoki.

Shior!

Nigerians consistently thinking like cows. 

Do you give birth to a girl child and pray that she earns less just so a random husband can be happy?

What is wrong with you people?!

When will this madness end?!
