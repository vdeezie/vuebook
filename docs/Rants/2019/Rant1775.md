This nude business always makes me laugh.

You people are sending nudes to your Nigerian lovers?!

Wawu! You are brave oo!

This Nigerian love relationships that are built on lies and nutured by SHAME?

You dare send your nudes to a lover? Have you not learnt anything in this life?!
.

Last week I read about a man who waited for his wife in Ajah traffic, just so he could beat her and push her out of the SUV he claimed to be his.

The other week, I heard of a man who went to his lover's shop to destroy all her goods.

Do you know what happened to these men eventually? 

Nothing!

As a matter of fact, people around the different scenes were BEGGING the men!!!

Imagine being a monster, yet having the opportunity to enjoy 5-star treatment for being a monster!
.

I mean, you don't even have to send nudes... all you need to do is DATE them, and they will find every means to shame you.

Don't be slow-witted, please.

How can you live with the thought that your nudes is in the care of an Ex?

A Nigerian Ex!!!

I'll be praying for you üôè
