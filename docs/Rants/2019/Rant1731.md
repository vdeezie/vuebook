Lagos is creatively dense. 

People who waste money on events will scowl, "How much can you make from Art?"

How much did you make from that free-for-all event?

All that money spent, for what? Clout?

If clout is your urgent poison, Art can give you clout too. It can give you clout that can land you on the pages newyorker(dot)com.

Art is a business not to be compared to oil, but a business still. An empire. A legacy. 

Art is priceless.

Why not turn an ordinary event to art so its double-entendre scores as genius?

Why not take that brand or idea and make it into an art form to be consumed by its audience differently, so it counts as artistic and innovative?

Why not stop doing it like everybody else?

All that money could have been utilized for an online series woven intricately into the qualities of your product or service. Not just lazy Ads.

At least, pretend to be ashamed to share the same world with Hollywood.

You don't need their latest technology as much as you need their creative drive...

Because even with the technology you will still not know what to create. 

Your money and new technology will still amount to naught.

For shame. 

This entire process of art is too hard for many... 

So let's throw an open event instead. And then justify why it is better than art.

After all, is it your money?
