Morning buzz from my boss.

Energy.

I believe strongly in energy. So I smiled when I read his message this morning.
.

He has provided me with everything required to make my job/life easy in Ghana.
.
.

My landlord was, at first, sceptical about renting his apartment to a Nigerian. Some Nigerians do terrible things here.

My boss showed up to defend me.

He left everything he was doing and drove all the way to assure the landlord that I was deserving. 

I've known him for less than a week, yet he goes all out to ensure I am comfortable to do what brought me to Ghana in the first place...

An opportunity to create Art in a saner environment.
.
.

The first time I met him was when he interviewed me.

"This is not an interview. This is a conversation. Tell me about yourself," he said and leaned back in his chair.

I spoke for one hour ðŸ˜‚

Assistant HR was taking notes.
.

When he shook my hand, he mentioned his name, but I didn't get it, and I was embarrased to ask again.

So I saved his number as CEO Ghana. And I decided to leave it like that ðŸ˜ƒ
