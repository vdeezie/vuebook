Family advice is so overrated. 

You grew up with these people. 

You already know how they think. 

You know your dad will flip if you decide to move to Niger state. 

You know your elder sister would hate for you to leave your job and start a business...

Yet you seek their advice every single time, and act hurt and surprised by their words.

You know these people, you can predict what they would say...

"Don't leave your marriage. Go and submit."

"Don't move to Japan, stay close to home."

"Don't push your head out, be seen not heard."

You already know. Yet you go and ask for advice. 

If you advice yourself will you die?

Why seek for advice you know you will not accept?

You people like pain.

It's all part of the Nigerian humility. 

You are an adult, abeg.

If you really want advice, you will seek from those whose opinions and patterns you are not yet familiar with. 

Me? I don't like advice, so I don't seek. However, I will gladly sit with a counselor if I can find one - a PRIVATE one.

Other than that, I'm good. 

What I do is share information on what I've already decided to do. It always annoys my family when I do this, but they'll be all right las' las'.

I listen to a lot of cheesy YouTube motivational videos to prep me up. I listen to music. I listen to my gut feeling. Then I go for it. 

I know what I want for myself.

You cannot want what is best for me more than I want it for myself.
