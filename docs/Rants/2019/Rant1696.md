I was having a conversation with a niggaa last night. 

We got comfortable enough to start talking about casual stuff. 

"So, is Nigerian jollof rice better than Ghanaian jollof? He asked. 

"Basically the same thing," I responded. 

"I'll love to eat your Nigerian meals soon."

"Sorry, I don't cook anymore," I said.
.

We talked about sleepovers. He sent pictures of his crib, I sent pictures of mine.

"What do you need all that space for?" He laughed. 

"For my mind. I like empty spaces. And also for my kids when they visit."

"Where do I sleep when I come over? Or may be you come to mine."

"If we ever get to that point, I prefer hotels - 4 stars, at least."

At this point I'm sure he is thinking: What an entitled bitch! 😂😂😂

Well I'm thinking: Niggaa I can afford this lifestyle. I live this lifestyle! When we start dating, you take over the lifestyle. If you can't, then be gone. I can afford it anyway! 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
.

So this Joy will not cook. She will not do sleepovers (at first) and allow him save money...

So what's in it for him? He must have wondered. 

Answer: Nothing. You get to date me, that's all.

And if I find you sexually attractive, we will have segz. 

Simple.

My age doesn't scare me. I am not afraid to be alone.

-Because this is how men operate. 

They confidently bring their big heads into relationships without any extra value and women accept them - at least those type of women.
.
.

I remember when The Boyfriend and I were redefining our relationship, and he asked...

"Do you love me, Joy?"

Even though we say it every day, he is asking me because I asked for a non-exclusive relationship. 

"I love you very much," I said.

"Would you be with me if I had no money?"

Now that's the kind of question I NEVER thought he'd ask. But these are desperate times, and his girlfriend is saying she wants the freedom to be celibate or not be celibate or whatever. The absolute freedom of choice without question. 

"You wouldn't want to date me if you were broke, trust me," I said.

He's a well-traveled niggaa, he gets it abeg.
.

Life is complicated. 

Humans are complicated. 

Let's stop acting like it's a bed of roses, jare.
