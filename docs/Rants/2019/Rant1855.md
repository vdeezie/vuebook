That was how I was invited to one office, and they took me to a room with digital movie cameras everywhere. 

Guess what they use those cameras for?

Two-minute commercials for their brands on social media.

🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

You have cameras. You have a room.

Turn the bloody room to a studio and use the  cameras to do what they are created for.

Produce 10-minute web series for your brand every other week on YouTube, hype the shit out of it, and build emotional ties with your customers. 

Take one-minute cuts and promote on all social  media platforms. 

You need to add just one more person to your team - a screenwriter, someone good with storytelling and branding. 

Not me. I will disrupt everything you have built and make you uncomfortable.

You can't afford me.

Find someone else. 

Just get it right already!

Ugh!

It annoys me how very little art people understand. 

Most West African companies and bosses refuse to evolve. 

I'm tired of them!
