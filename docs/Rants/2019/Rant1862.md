One day I was driving my kids to school (when they were still day students)...

We were having a random conversation in the car, laughing about something...

Then I saw their father trekking to wherever.

I told them...

"Oh look! That's your father behind us."

They turned and looked. I kept driving.

The car was quiet for only a minute, then the older one said...

"Strange."

And we continued talking about random things.
.
.

That marriage seemed like an out-of-body experience. 

Some kind of extraterrestrial BS.

Whew.
.
.

See ehn...

Life is beautiful. Life is strange. Life IS.

Life IS.

If you are ever going to have life's full experience, you have to be ready for whatever. 

Love your journey.

Embrace the process. 

Life IS.
