I think 'packaging' as a term for companies, celebrities and public personalities should take a cue from Cardi B.

The uppity-style self-branding we are used to with certain people is so last year.

People respond with just as much venom as those who show disregard to the collective struggle of others.

People are fighting against arrogance as a PR form.

And it's not just regular people. Even those who carry influence online are distancing themselves from brands and personalities that are insensitive and conceited.

Nobody wants to defend the big-headedness of others. And PR can do only so much if your brand projects shitty behaviour.

Come with authenticity. Show respect. Have a real personality. Rinse. Repeat.

Put in the work to be a genuine person.

See what Cardi B is doing in Lagos. 

The effortlessness of her brand. 

The excitement. The big personality.

Everything!

If she is acting it all, then she is a good actor and she should add that to her résumé.

This is by far the best impression of a celebrity I have had since... forever!

Some people have it.

Some never will.

PR can only do so much if your soul is dead.
.

From the streets of Victoria Island, to the strip club, to Ebeano supermarket to shop for the poor, to pictures of random street kids...

It's not just the activities, it is the honesty of her brand.

There's something there - it's in her soul.

That excitement is not plastic. 

She is alive. She is fully alive.
