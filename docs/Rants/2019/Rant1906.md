“ThEy sHouLd hAve sHowcAsEd LaGos tOurISm to CaRdi B…”

Cardi B wanted to go to a strip club. She wanted to drive through the streets of Lagos and take selfies. She even asked to go see the ghetto.

She wants to experience the real Nigeria through the eyes of a lower-middle class citizen.

She don’ want no tourist attraction.

She is not Nelson Mandela.

You can’t turn everyone to deep-woke scholar.

She wants to see booty. She wants to spray booty plenty money. She wants booty in her face. She wants to connect with people we don’t normally connect with openly.

You can’t make every celebrity care about Badagry Slave Trade and cultural artefacts.

That knowledge is important… but so is strip club.

There’s a story there for any journalist to write… Yes, the existing economics of strip clubs. But no! You want her to represent some cultural idea.

Life is not linear. Let people express life with authenticity. Interests have to be genuine.

You are not going to put that responsibility of selling Nigeria on a rapper from America.

Da fuq!

Let her eat her morning pancakes and drink her evening beer.

Make sure her hotel room is well fumigated oo!

We don’t want her coming to Accra with malaria.

Toh.
