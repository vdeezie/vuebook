Dad vs. Mum
.
.

My dad and mum were watching TV one night. It was routine every night, after dinner. They sat on the long couch drinking beer and watching the News. After the news came music interlude before a local soap opera.

We weren't allowed to interrupt them. We went to our own sitting room and watched Indian movies.

Sometimes, my dad would send for me to join them.

"Drink beer!" He would say. His beer was always so chilled. 

I was sipping my dad's beer from when I was, say, five years old. Three sips and he'll let me go.

It continued till I was 10. 

I hated the taste of beer but I did it for my dad, and I did it for its vanity - for the obvious fact that I was his favourite kid.
.

So this night, he called for me.

"Get me another beer, Isi."

I was nine at the time, I think. 

I got him a bottle of beer from the fridge. 

"Sit and drink some." 

He gave me his glass, and out of love and vanity, I drank that cold piss. 

His brand was Star Lager beer. 

So I decided to stay with them, not because they were watching anything interesting for a kid, but it always made me feel special to know I alone had access to this hour others were forbidden to share with them.

After the news, Ayinla Kollington - fuji musician - came on air. He was dancing in loose trousers with some Yoruba dancers in awful makeup.

My dad said...

"This man has no shame. Singing and grinding, pushing his groin in and out like a retard. Look at his skin -  bleached! Disgusting!"
.

My mum scoffed...

"You that have bars and clubs where men spray half-naked women on a pole, you don't have shame abi? Those club girls on your payroll... many of them are bleached, not so?!"

😂😂😂
.

Dad got defensive...

"Excuse me, my business is legitimate, acknowledged by the state, protected by law."

"I agree. But is Kollington's singing career not legitimate and acknowledged by the state? Shior!" My mother replied.

🤣🤣🤣

Daddy - 0
Mummy - 10
