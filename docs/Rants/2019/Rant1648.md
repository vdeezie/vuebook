Africans do not know how to run businesses. 

They do not have proper structures that are functional and practical and positioned to produce brilliant results from their teams.

And this is rich coming from me because I do not want to be an entrepreneur. 

As a people, we lack imagination and it shows in the structures we build in offices, what we protect, what we shun etc.

We are more concerned in the Letter and not the Spirit of the organization. 

The letter states this is how it is done.

But what does the spirit say?

Nobody knows. It's hard work to understand the "spirit" of an organisation, so everybody sticks to the letter.

It is why we recyle people.

In developed nations, organisations DISCOVER people. 

In Africa we wait for them to do something, then we borrow their style. 

We are unashamedly mediocre that we count it all joy when we get good feedback from ourselves. 

Third-world dweller patting the back of another third-world dweller.

An acknowledgedment and appreciation of the unexceptional, an applause to the unremarkable. 

A celebration of half-pie.

PS:
Yet for a continent to be so average, and some parts of it do not have constant electricity, and the citizens be so proud of it, shows how very low we have placed the bar.

At least have electricity then we can talk about excellence ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
