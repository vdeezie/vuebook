I saw Ebuka at Ebeano supermarket! 😁

I was like... "Ebukaaaa!"

We hugged.

And he was like... "Ah! Joy, how are you? Good to see you. How is work?" 

And I was like... "Work is fine. How is family?"
.
.

I don't care very much for a lot of things.

But Ebuka is totally worth the minute to stop and say hello and a hug.

He is vibez all day, every day.

A beautiful man.
