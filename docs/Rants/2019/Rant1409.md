January 2, 2019

I bought me an end-of-2018 gift a few weeks back. 

2018 was a rollercoaster. 

On one hand I was emotionally drained. On the other hand I was uplifted.

It was confusing. It was exciting. It was everything. 

But I do not wish to go through that kind of emotional ride again.

I only survived because I decided to turn lemons to lemonades. And that wasn't easy. I could have curled into a ball and let time pass. But I dragged myself up every day to make something out of a broken situtation.

At the end of the year, I broke up with the man I loved. The hundredth time! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Then the next day, I broke up with the man who loved me.

So in essence, I let everyone go with their love and confusion.

I was tired.
.

So in 2019, I will like to have a relationship for the entire year.

Confession: I have never dated for a full year. Ever! (Apart from being in a marriage, of course).

I will like to date for one full year. No "buts". No insecurities. No dealing with the "other woman" situation. Pff!

One year. Then the world can have him back.

Until then...

Here's a Roberto Cavalli splurge for my heart.

Or feet.
