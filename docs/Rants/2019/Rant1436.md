Oprah will soon call Mackenzie to her couch for her usual pity-party chat trying to get her to cry and call her husband some kind of m.o.n.s.t.e.r.

Binch, she's richer than you now.

Leave dat tin.

Then Will Smith's wife will drag the rest of what she can drag to her red table talk.

Oh no! She interviews only black women.

All these people going on about Mackenzie writing the Amazon business proposal/plan...

Pray tell, how much does it really cost to write a proposal if she was contracted out of matrimony to write it?

Are you really going to hinge her worth on something she did a hundred years ago?

That is not the strength of her worth. 

It is the LAW that is the wind beneath her wings, not what you may think she contributed to her husband's business.

And you can also throw in the fact that she kept the domestic part of their lives functioning. 

However, Jeff Bezos IS the businessman. And in no time, he will exceed her own wealth.
