Television is going out of relevance. 

TV will be rendered obsolete in a not-so-distant future. 

It's ridiculous that TV commercials are still the most expensive. 

Nobody is watching...

Except nannies and househelps.

Those who watch TV have very little purchasing power. 

Housewives, if they watch at all, have specific shows and channels like the horrific Zee World and Africa Magic.

And CEOs have CNN.

Kids are bored with the repetition of Disney shows. They prefer Netflix. Yes. 
.

I had three LED smart screen in my office and my two apartments... and I never really watched any shows. 

I'd subscribe to DSTV and forget to ever turn on the television. 

TV is the modern-day fax machine. 

In my opinion.
