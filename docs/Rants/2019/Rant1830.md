I don't think there's anything more demoralizing and disrespectful to a human person than to be the banter and the centre of discussions around indices of your poverty.

You can't even be poor and Nigerian in peace...

The I-too-sabi-speak-grammar crew will come and badger you to accept that "things are getting better".

They throw indicators around of growth that you do not see, you cannot experience.

They insist that things are getting better, yet you still don't have a job, you don't have toilet, you cannot feed...

SARS is killing Nigerians and getting away with it. Kidnapping is becoming more dynamic. Education is still a disgrace. Public hospitals are pit toilets. 

You know this because you live this life. 

But people will gather and reduce you to banter,  to statistics... and you have no voice to speak. 
.

May we not be in conversations that reduce our human reality and experience.

To be reduced to a piece of data, especially in a country like Nigeria that holds no accountability whatsoever...

It must be the worst experience for those who don't need indicators.

Their indicators are right in front of them - no food!

Period.
