You know all those "perfect" men...

Tall, ripped, beard gang, woke, dapper, pink lips (uugh!!!), broad shoulders?

Their physical attractiveness does absolutely nothing for me.

I just saw one taking a walk, looking like a fine billboard.

Absolutely nothing in me flinched. 

It's like flipping through GQ magazine... all those lovely male Ads, yet nothing really registers in your mind.

Soon, 'absolute gorgeousness' will be boring and lame.

My male needs are simple...

Just have sense, zero mouth odour, zero body odour, zero misogyny, 100% love for art, 101% love for the art I create, plus sense to know that the only thing worth sponsoring or investing in is art - my art 😁

And money to make me happier, and we are good 😁

Not just money,  but available money.

In Nigeria, you can date a rich nigga and the money isn't his... it's THEIRS.

That is him and someone else's (but he will not talk oo) 😂😂

So, it is not about the money he has. It is the money available! 

LMAO!

I know. I know.

Better to date a solid middle-class man with money like a river, than a rich man who needs to defend every other penny he takes out of the account. 

I mean, this is Patriarchy after all.

Patriarchy invites you to play poker every damn time.

Play to win.

PS:
Please do not be tempted to use this post to remind women to make their own money. That narrative suffers a dirty blow on my wall. It can  never hold water. We make good money. 

So daz no' de point.
