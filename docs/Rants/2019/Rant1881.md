There are two types of people...

1. People who want to be happy.

2. People who want to be right.
.
.

If you strive for happiness, do not get into intimate relationships with people who strive to always be right.

Your mental health will sink right in the pits.

Don't do it.

You can't help it if they are family members, because you had no choice who your parents/siblings are.

But for relationships and friendships you get to choose, make sure you understand the type of people they are...

Do they want to be happy more than they want to be right?

Or is being right more important to them than happiness?
.

Mehn, I just want to be happy oo!

I can't remember half the wrong people do.

And if I do remember, I don't think about it.

I just want to be happy.

I can't go on and on arguing about anything.

You will never find me on a thread doing shit like that.

I say my mind and that's it.

Any responses away from the people I allow within my circle, I don't care.

I will never try to argue my point just to be right.

I want to be happy hundred times more than I ever want to be right.
.

And I'm glad The Boyfriend is exactly like that...

Because the shit I put that man through last year, if he was more interested in being right...

He'd be right, but we won't be together.
.

Same thing with Prisca.

After a while, we stopped bothering about who's right or wrong in our friendship.

We want to be happy friends. Period.

Abi, Priscoco? 游때游땢
.

I will never let anyone who wants to be right have access to my personal space - even family.

We can love each other from a distance.

I want to be very wrong but happy.

Thanks.

PS: Now let me go and lie down like a kitten and get ready for earth-shattering cunnilingus... as my niggaa rounds up his meeting at the lobby.
