The most un-creative creative director in the world was giving a new girl in the office some welcome tips...

"Know that as a woman, you have your place. You don't need to be struggling aggressively with a man, it will not -"

I just put my earphones on.

It is the best filter of BS.
.

I remember one time, I forgot my earphones in my apartment. I was already 20 minutes away...

I told the Uber to turn back and take me home.

Better to be late to work than listen to someone's constant "advice" and chatter with colleagues, displaying deep-seated insecurities and hallucination of being king - a position earned without any real creative gusto.

I always have my earphones on here, even when I'm not listening to music. 

When I take it off, I feel naked.
.

And when I think of it now...

I never had to use earphones everywhere I've worked in Lagos, because....

Eko la wa yi. I go call you noisemaker and dare you to DO the job required of you. Nor be mouth. Create, if you dare.

But Accra energy is very different. And I'm too bored to care. 

And too busy writing scripts. 

Person wey buy load, make e carry.

I'm done trying to clean up people's companies from mediocre vibes. 

I'm saving all my energy for myself and for my kids - when I become a momager, and help them build their careers and empire. 
.

Anyway, it's almost over. I just need to clean my earphones so they stay on permanently for the days left.
.
.

Have a good day, y'all.
