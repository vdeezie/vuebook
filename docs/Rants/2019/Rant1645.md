Ghana time is one hour behind Nigeria. 

As I write this post, the current local time in Accra is 10:30am.

That's 11:30am in Nigeria. 

However, I decided to set my clock and phone at Nigerian time, whilst living and working in Ghana.

Why?

It helps with my peace of mind... the illusion of witnessing life before my time. 

If the clock says 11am, for instance, and my reality is 10am, it gives me some kind of supernatural advantage to live within an hour - twice.

It's like being blessed with 48 hours every day.

It's enjoying a second chance every hour.

Living and succeeding by clairvoyance.

Does anyone understand?

Because... if I fix it as the right Ghana time, then I'm just mortal. 

And there's no fun in that.

PS: I made breakfast. I don't have the right knife to slice potatoes so my fries came out zig-zag. I'll be at the mall tomorrow, after work, for part 2 domestic shopping ðŸ˜›
