# Rant1811


September 20, 2019

I met one of my Ghanaian followers this evening. 

She saw me on the aisle of a shopping mall.

She stopped and said...

"Joy? You are Joy Bewaji."

I said, "Yelz".

She smiled, stretched her hand out for a handshake. 

"Nice to meet you, Joy. I am a follower. I read your rants."

"Thanks. Nice to meet you too."

We both continued shopping on our different aisles.
.

If it is Lagos.

Hei God!!!

Lagos followers wee be screaming from the beginning of the aisle, screaming...

"Joooooooy!"

Everybody wee turn and be looking...

Follower wee borrow napkin from the shelf and fly like superman to my aisle in slow motion.

"Selfieeeeeeee! Pliiiiiiiiix!" She wee say.

She wee take selfie. Then she wee start to hyperventilate. 

Some of them wee start to cry. 
Some of them wee start to tell me how their marriage is slowing them down.

And I wee be smiling becoz I don't know what I should be doing. 

Then they will now ask for a favour...

"Plix add me as your friend on Facebook."

She wee say I must add her before she let me go.

I wee become prisoner. 

It gets more complicated...

She will call her friend on the queue to come and see JIB...

The friend wee come and be carrying nose.

That one is a hater. Her artery wee soon burst. Ki lon ko mi.

Then follower wee call her 8 year old daughter on the other queue.

"She reads your rants."

Bhet she is jus' eight fa! What about all the segz I talk about?

Then she wee show me the last inbox message she sent me... she wants the solution to that particular matter. 

"Oya answer," she will demand with a smile. 

Then she wee return the cape, sorry, napkin on the shelf.

And she will wave and say...

"God bless you for all you do."

Then onions wee enter my eye.

And I wee be feeling somehow and tears will be playing by the corner of my eye. 

And I wee say a little prayer as I watch her go...

That the universe be kind to her. 

She wee turn one last time at the exit door and wave.

And I wee be feeling unworthy of all that love.

Ah! Na wa! 

Lagos people are too dramatic. Too much emotional investment fa!

Lemme oo!

 Be like Ghanaians!
