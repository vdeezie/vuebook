I don't need too many receipts.

If I have to choose between an M.I and a Vector for anything in this world...

I will choose Vector. 

Courage is one of the most attractive qualities in a man.

M.I speaks from too many sides of his mouth (and that's crazy, because there are only two sides to the mouth), without ever truly standing for something. 

Vector is not backing down. He started a fight. He knows M.I gets a lot of love from people. Vector will piss on all that love.

How can you not like that?

A real niggaa. Absolutely no fvcks to give.

Vector is the underdog. And he is still doing his thing without half the love M.I receives. 

He has been trending at number one since yesterday.

The noise is not loud. The fan base is not as colourful...

But like I have always said... 

Numbers is nothing for a man/woman who has no fear.

When you stop being afraid you have won.

When you have courage, you gain the strength of two million people. 

If you have courage, you will easily take down 500 average thinking people.

It's mathematics. 

One person + courage = 2,000,000 persons.

That is Vector. 

You didn't take him to number one on trends. None of us did. As a matter of fact, you tried to play down his response to M.I.

But you see, you are dealing with a mad person who has COURAGE.

You will never conquer someone like that. 

So M.I and one million of his fans, still not as strong as one Vector. 

That's fact.
