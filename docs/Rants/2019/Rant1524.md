The Accidental Entrepreneur #09

If you run small businesses...

Ensure that all your businesses leverage on one another's strength.

Do not be afraid or ashamed to project one business on the platform you have created for another business. 

You must know where businesses can meet so collaborations can happen.

For instance, I will always reserve Ad spaces in Island Weekly for my other businesses.

Island Weekly's reach is amazing!

You may not have a robust advertising budget, but you have platforms you have created for your businesses. Use them.

This week's edition will be at Sweet Sensation, Ikoyi - right on the shelf, among other Island malls and outlets giving our magazine for FREE!

More reach guaranteed. 
.

Turn your small businesses to siblings, and let them team up to confront the bully called Life when it throws hard blows.
.

As you can see, I have occupied Ad spaces in the next edition of Island Weekly.

This edition will get to 4,000 stores, malls, businesses and/or personalities in Nigeria.

That means over 8,000 persons will have direct access to it. 

Why would I want to give that away to other businesses when I can eat my cake and have it? 🤷🏽‍♀️😂😁😊

That 'TAAC for Kids' will be seen in the magazine, on page 2, and will reach over 3,000 middle-class mothers.

That's strategy.

Position your businesses for greatness.
.

But hey! I have left one spot for any other business that would like to reach 8,000 vibrant potential customers on the Island.

You have the weekend to decide. 

We are going to press by Monday.

Interested in advertising on that spot?

Grab it now!
