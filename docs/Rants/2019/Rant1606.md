You don't have to like Thanos.

I dont like him either.

But you have to respect him.

He wanted something, and he wanted it so desperately he put his heart into it.

He wanted to destroy the world.

It's a valid ambition. 

Why?

Let me ask...

If YOU had the opportunity to destroy half the population in Nigeria, wouldn't you?

Wouldn't you want to wipe out all this folly in Nigeria? 

Wouldn't you like to get rid of half the ignorance we suffer?

Wouldn't you want to erase millions of the under-achieving generations?

If you had the power, wouldn't you want to recalibrate?

I would. 

Without thinking twice.
.

Thanos believed in something, and he saw it to the very end.

Only death could stop him.
.

And let's not forget he gave the most brilliant quotes that should be framed.

He was a genius. A very intelligent creature. 

It was sad to watch him vanish.

In reality, a Thanos would succeed...

But movies owe us poetic justice. 

So there.
