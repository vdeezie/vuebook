# Rant1895


November 21 2019

An acquaintance said she was about to pay for a counsellor...

I got the counsellor's name and went through her social media opinions.

I just laughed.

If you don't know what to do with your money, give it to me. You can't know someone like me and be dashing your money to these conventional sounding boards.

I mean... is your counsellor smarter than me?

Let me answer my question: NO!

These patriarchal princesses whipping out biblical verses as foundation for their secular profession... mindless of new thinking, afraid of culture, dancing dirty with Patriarchy.

I mean... you know me, yet you want to go and sit on someone's couch to receive a bunch of conventional doctrines.

What is wrong with you?

Read my rants and be healed, abeg.

Or you can bring the money. I still have enough space in my bank account.

Toh.
