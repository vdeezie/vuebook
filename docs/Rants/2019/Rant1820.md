Irony is when a critic is upset that his/her critique is criticized by others. 

The Literati can sit through a war, reading, critiquing and engaging with a book on war, right at the heart of gross abuse of power... yet believe they are making an impact.

Again, the irony. 

Nollywood is the closest reality to our collective suffering and/or grandiosity. Not the Literati.

Nollywood is trying to tell our stories. 

Like the Literati, they were once obsessed with poverty porn.

We rebelled, and now they are trying to be like mainstream Hollywood, and there's also the attempt to improve on dialogue.

If ever I want to read a critique on Nollywood, I do not want it from The Literati.

A people so stuck on smelling their fart and thinking they have blessed the world with oxygen. 

To even give audience to the criticism of Nollywood from people who cannot bear to be criticized by their own.

Go ahead and say one unflattering remark about their book festivals. Share a critical opinion about their gathering right in the heart of abominable human rights violation...

Sit back and see what they will do to you.

Right down to opportunities that they have some kind of power to influence, they will try to destroy you.

This is not a personal story, as I will not ever put myself in a position to be favoured by man (in this context, male and female).

Yet these people who have stood behind tyrannical rule and have kept quiet through abuse of power, think they can advise Nollywood. 

Shift abeg!
.

And yet there's another angle...

What the so-called Literati wants is definitely not what I want to see on big screen...

And I am not even the average Nigerian, yet I am certain whatever they assume good cinema should be, will not appeal to me... how much more the average Nigerian.
.

I saw the trailer of Living in Bondage, and believe it or not, I cried.

Yes, I cry a lot but that's not the point.

I am proud of the fvcking gloss on this sequel. I am proud of Ramsey Noauh.

King of Boys is a good movie. 

I hear Set-Up by Niyi is a good movie.

Love and War is in the cinema.

BBB Media is pushing his 2020 Valentine movie, Dear Affy.

Nollywood is doing things. It is not where it should be, but unlike a lot of other industries it is trying to get better. 

However, how a country without, say, basic medical care think they deserve a Nollywood on a Hollywood standard, beats me.

Mediocrity is everywhere in Nigeria, why do you put the responsibility of excellence on Nollywood particularly?

I'm not even a fan of Nollywood, but I'd be damned to think The Literati are in any position to  critique that industry.

A people who squash dissenting voices for sport. 

The closest most toxic, delusional mafia. When they recruit you, a fog appears in your vision forever.

Nollywood peeps are not nearly as vindictive as the Literati. 

Go take off the log in your big brown eyes, dear Literati. 

Leave Nollywood out of your conversations. You have more dirt to dust off your path.#Rant1820
