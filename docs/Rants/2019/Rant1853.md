Dear MCMs and WCWs in business...

Branding is not just a catchy business name, a good graphic artist, a good camera, or sponsored pages...

Branding is more than that.

Branding is a story. 

Branding is an emotional journey.

Branding is the sweetest gesture towards someone you wish to gain their trust, in the context of sales.

Branding should describe human experiences and how consumers can relate to it.

Branding is a love affair.

So...

On that table where you plan to brainstorm and plan out your business with all the stakeholders present...

Make sure to have a storyteller present. 

No, I didn't say brand manager. 

Move with the times, work with a storyteller.

The difference in your branding and the responses will shock you.

A brand manager is a cup of water. You're going to get stuck at some point. Uninspired. It will come. 

A storyteller is a river. Because stories (properly branded) never get old.

God is on your side if you find a storyteller with brand experience. The jackpot!

Update your staff requirements.

Thank me later.
