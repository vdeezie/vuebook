I legit went to my boss and said...

"There's no energy in this binsh." 😂😂😂

This is not a bank nah 🤷🏽‍♀️

I was invited for an interview at a company last week. 

The CEO was IT!

Niggaa had fire in his bones!

I loved it!!

We chatted for up to an hour after the interview. 

I fell in love.

But I couldn't take the job. And he was very disappointed.

I have to be a decent human being. Someone was already spending so much money on my work and resident permits. 

But I couldn't stop thinking about the other company. 

So I told my boss about it.

"I experienced someone's energy last week, and it is all I can think about. Energy is everything! I will give half my fancy salary to feel that energy. We need to light this place up. This is a  creative space. Let's set our bones on fire."

He nodded.

"Thank you. Not many people say it this way."

I hope he does something about it...

Because I know myself too well.#Rant1646
