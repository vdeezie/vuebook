Next room wahala.

These ones have managed to pay for one night, and their bed has been creaking all day.

It was loud music at first. Now it is kpa-kpa-kpakiri-kpakiri.

I have been here 8 nights with my celibacy, minding my art jejely.

Morning should come so they can carry their load and go home. 

Let me enjoy the peace I paid for.

Toh.
