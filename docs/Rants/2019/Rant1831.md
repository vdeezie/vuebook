Yas!!!

A client wants a telenovela script!

Yaaaas!!! 💃💃💃

I have always wanted to write a telenovela. 
.
.

I am finally going to have someone die for love literally, and I will not feel silly about it rara.

Because it is a telenovela, binsh!!!

Ah! Bless!

I'll also have someone elope with a total stranger because... serendipity. 

I'll have characters look into each other's eyes and promise to love unconditionally as they ride off into the sunset.

I am going to be so cheesy, it'll be annoyingly addictive. 
.

Viewers will be like...

"Oh God! What is that Prisca going to do this week? Is she really going to run away with Uwem?"

"Dear Lord, why is Idem falling for that rich man's son? Can't she see that the other rich man's son is ready to buy her a bigger castle? Let me go and watch."

"Hei God oo! Why is Tomiwa crying because Teetee left him? Man up jor. This thing is just annoying me."

Ati be be lo.

Then I'll have like 10 'Bolas' inside playing small small roles becoz the name is too common and nobody wants their protagonist to be answering common name 🤷🏽‍♀️

Bhet... I shall name one mighty village king 'Awe', for the culture 😁

I can't wait o jare!

My first Telenovela!!! 🤩💃💃😀😀😁😁
