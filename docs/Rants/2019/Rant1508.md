One of the most ridiculous set of people on earth are those who date or marry down and expect their partners to be grateful in the long run.

LOL!

You want your spouse to feel indebted to you? You want a duty-bound marriage?

You want the person you are sleeping with to be thankful they have you? You want them to give oral segz feeling privileged to be going down on you?

LMAO!

You are low-key narcissist sha. Conceited peeps everywhere. 

Save yourself from self-obsession and go marry your kind. 

Rest.

Nobody should feel "privileged" in a relationship. Stop gloating over nonsense.

Marry on your level. Let everybody be equal.

Stop looking for someone to emotionally blackmail along the line because your self-importance is screwing with your brain.

"I married him when he had nothing."

Who forced you?

Didn't you see the niggaa with the rolls royce before you settled for the trekker-of-life.

Buzz off, abeg!
