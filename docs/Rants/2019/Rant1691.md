When I was the editor of Genevieve magazine – like a hundred years ago – my father would always ask for a new edition. He would summon me, grumbling that he couldn’t get it from his vendors.

“Get me the new edition! I need to show my friends!” he would say.

“Daddy, you have no friends,” I would roll my eyes.

I mean, who are we kidding, we knew why they hung around him – free booze, free cash, free every-every. That’s not friendship, niccur! 😂😂

“Just get me the magazine!” he'd demand.

He acted like the magazine was some kind of recreational drug.

So I would get the magazine and if I was unfortunate to meet him with his “friends” – whom I didn’t give a fvck about – with their parasitic asses… I will stand as he praised me from morning till evening… without offering me a seat or a beer! 🤷🏽‍♀️

I will just stand there like a mannequin. And my dad would go on and on and on.

“I fear this girl *hic*. Do you know I fear my own daughter?!’ 
He would “hic” his words in drunken delight, reaching out for my arm to tap it, like an expensive product to be displayed.

“Why you fear her? *hic*” His annoying drunken pals will ask.

“Her brain… too sharp! She sef does not know how sharp it is, but I know *hic* *hic*”

I will roll my eyes and count to hundred. This man let me go! 😂😂

Why did I remember this?

My father never asked me what I earned as an editor at Genevieve magazine.

Industry rate at the time, Genevieve magazine was paying the highest editor’s salary… and I had a brand new car too.

But he never asked.

He wasn’t even excited when I showed him my new car.

And he never asked what I earned.
.

One day, I asked him why he never asked.

He shrugged…

“I have money, a lot of it. And I know it doesn’t matter. I know it means nothing. Just keep writing. You will be very happy.”

That's what he said to me.

Sigh.

I owe this world one thing – my father’s biography.

I will write it even if it is the last thing I do.

My father was the only father like my father.

Whew!

What a man!
