September 15, 2019

One of my followers is moving to another African country on a whim, and she wanted some kind of advice or outline on how to go about it.

I won’t advice anyone to move impulsively. I am clearly not of this world, so I do things with a little madness.

Do. Not. Try. This. At. Home.
.

I’ve said this many times, I had no outline when I moved to Accra. None.

Nonetheless, so you get the picture (and not think I am trying to shove you off), I will recap step by step how it all happened.
.

Day 1: I woke up one morning, bored with this silly entrepreneurship journey Lagosians yap about, and decided to move to Accra. I had 5 small businesses, yet the only thing I wanted to really do was write. I was ignoring a big part of my life just so I could go with a trend. I was disappointed in myself. I used to have a very strong will. Why was I buying-and-fucking-selling? I am an artist!!! I hated Lagos so much at this point, I could taste it on my tongue. I wanted to leave.

Day 2: I told The Boyfriend about it. He has come to understand not to stand in my way. So he did the decent thing – he let me be, even though he had his reservations, he said nothing. Because if he had tried to stop me, I would have left him. I won’t waste any time in leaving everything behind - including him. He knew this. I’m glad he had the requisite wisdom for the hour.

Day 3: I posted my decision to move to Accra online.

Day 4: I had more than enough leads. So I started making calls and sending emails.

Day 5: I told my manager, Roberta we would travel to Accra. We got her international passport fresh from the bakery, and we set a date.

Day 6: I called my travel agent to book two tickets to Accra for 11 days – for me and my manager. I wanted some kind of moral support as I go about trying to get a job. Not just any job but a creative job. A creative job on a certain chain of command.

Day 7: I booked an apartment online. A friend had stayed there. It had wifi and house cleaning. A very beautiful  place.

Day 12: We travelled to Accra.

Day 13: I met my first contact. It was a shitty meeting. I never called her or reached out to her again.

Day 14: I was drained from that horrible meeting, so I went jogging and I listened to a ton of cheesy motivational videos on YouTube. Even when it started raining, I didn’t stop jogging. I hid my phone inside my pocket and listened to more cheesy videos to “Never Give Up”. It helped.

Day 14: I went for an interview. Did a shitty job at negotiating my salary after an impressive presentation I gave.

Day 15: Emilia sent a message in my inbox to buy my book. That message changed my life.

Day 16: I started a conversation with Emilia. She is in corporate Ghana (not a hustler), and I realised this is the kind of person I should be talking to. Emilia taught me within a few hours how to negotiate in cedis and dollars. She is the sole reason my life is as beautiful as it is here. I will never forget her, and I shall never stop looking for ways to reward her for her kindness. Thank you, Emilia. 

Day 17: I called the interviewer and asked to renegotiate. He said it was fine.

Day 18: I was at the office to renegotiate and we came to an agreement. Even Emilia was surprised I could get a deal that good. I slept like a baby that night.

Day 20: I went to another interview and got the job immediately. Pay was slightly less but other perks covered up. So now I had to choose.

This was my Day 7 and I already had two job offers.

Day 21: Had a few more meetings and interviews, but at this time I was picky. I had two solid offers already, so I skimmed through the rest of the hour until it was time to return to Lagos.

.

Remember, all I did was put up a post, got leads, followed through with all the confidence I had – cold calls and emails. And at the end of the tunnel were two good offers.

Day 25: Back to Lagos, I had two weeks only before I move finally to Accra. Kindly note I was searching for accommodation during my stint in Accra with my manager. I checked over 25 houses. I paid for one, but then it rained and I saw the road for what it was. Thankfully I got my money back.

I returned to Lagos and stayed at Oriental hotel for a week because I was selling off everything I had in my apartment. 

A week later, I was back to Accra. I came back and stayed at La Palm Beach Hotel. I was there for a week – a week before I resumed so I could get an apartment.

I finally chose the job I wanted. I met with an agent, and she took me to this really nice place. I fell in love with it the minute I saw it – palm fronds at the entrance, the entire charm of bourgeoisie taste. I paid for it immediately after the tour.

The next week I resumed.

Everything happened in a month - from May to June.
.

A month later, I got all my papers complete.

Prior to my decision to move, I had never met my boss, never met Emilia, and didn’t know anyone in Accra.

But you must understand that I am an artist. It is my right to live this way. I don’t think in figures. I think with the wind in my hair and the itch to fly.

I am slightly mad. I don’t give a fvck about anything – people will never understand how much of a fvck I don’t give. It would scare you. I don’t care for life, I don’t care for death. I sure as hell don’t care for anyone’s approval. You can keep your “likeness” to yourself, it doesn’t pay my bills. You know?

Your friendship will not pay my ticket to Mauritius. I mean, we have to think about these things in practical terms.

My greatest concern now is creating content for the 10 brands I handle in the office as a creative strategist/director. 
I have scripts I have to finish before the end of September. 
And I still have over 50 videos for my directing masterclass.

These are the important things that mean something to me. I am an artist. 

Do you understand?

I have to live the life I want to live… without the burden of anyone’s approval. There will always be people like me, they are just too afraid to live in their truest form.

Well, I am not. And in some ways, I hope I inspire the unconventional ones. I know you want this life. Go and get it.

And lastly, I am not afraid – of getting or losing. I am not afraid. Period.

I think all of these play a huge role why things happen the way they happen in my life.

I also think the cosmic is amused by my decision to be defined by nothing.

It’s a little deeper than all of this, but I’m sure you get the drift.

I give my best always, but if I don’t have to give my best anymore, then I would give nothing at all.

No half measures.

Dying every day helps too. I think a lot of what I am is because I am not afraid of dying.

For everyone trying to live an original life, good luck.

Oh! A pretty picture to go with this long ass rant...
