I've been wearing HAIR LUVAZ for three weeks now.

Sample products. I ALWAYS do sample products.
.

Yesterday, I finally told the boyfriend about it.

"Do you like my hair?"

We were walking around the hotel, after dinner.

He stopped to look at me.

"Of course, I do," he replied. 

"Well, it's my brand," I said.

"Your brand? How?? Isn't this one of the wigs you bought at so-and-so on Admiralty way?"

"No. This is MY brand."

I told him about it finally.

He was nodding.

"One day, I'll go for a quick meeting in Switzerland, and before I come back, you would have started a hotel!"

We laughed.

"You are the best housewife I know," he added.

"Huh???" I frowned.

"Housewives symbolise prudence and shrewdness. You give them N5k, they nurture and spread the sum to solve a domestic need of N50k. That's what you do all the time!" He said. 
"See what you have done with small money. You keep turning the money over and over and over again. You got a lump salary and made six businesses out of it. Many people would have gone for one vacation and squandered the entire sum. You gave that salary real value," he added.

I was blushing like a child.

"If I say I am proud of you one more time, then an angel has to come forth and put a f*cking halo on your head. Well done, King," he smiled. 

The boyfriend called me King! 😮

And he curses now. He used to be a good boy, very elite with his English. See what I have done to him 😂😂😂
