Every time I am about to resume in a new office... 

I always pray to meet someone exceptionally creative, brilliant, kind, full of passion for the job, love working late, and driven by new knowledge as a way of life, not just theory.

And every time, it never happens.

These people don't exist. Else how does one explain the constant heartbreak of working with uninspiring people all the damn time?

Did I come too early in life? Did I come too late?

Every single place I have worked, people were more interested in the politics of the office.
.

Then I sink deep into a place where I am alone, even when I am in the midst of others.

And I want to leave. 

I want to take a long drive and never come back.
.

I am searching for something.

I don't know what it is.

I am searching for someone I will never meet.

I'm looking forward to a conversation no one can deliver.

I am always alone even when I am not.
.

And this is why scriptwriting is important to me - I get to create these characters and I get to sit in the office with them ðŸ˜Š

PS: It's gonna be a great week ðŸ’–
