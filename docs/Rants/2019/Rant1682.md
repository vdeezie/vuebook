I haven't entered the third bedroom or the extra bathroom and toilet in my apartment since I moved in a month ago.

Yesterday as I was heading to work, I walked towards that direction - towards the spare bedroom and washroom. 

I held the door dividing the toilet and bathroom, about to open...

Then I changed my mind.

One full month and I have treated that part of my apartment as if it belongs to someone else.

What if I open the door and find Drogon with Daenerys' body?

These things cross my mind sometimes 🤷🏽‍♀️
