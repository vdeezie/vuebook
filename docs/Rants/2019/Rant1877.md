The Patriarchy in Nigeria is trying to break Kiki Mordi.
.
.
.

That was what they did when a woman fought for a prostitute on these FB streets...

The Patriarchy made sure she came back to apologise to men and others who were offended by her actions.
.
.

It was what they did to Morayo of Your View on TVC.

The Patriarchy humbled her.

They made her cry and apologise for speaking a general truth.
.
.

What did all these women do? Nothing!

They committed no crime.

They only used their voices and platforms to speak against crimes perpetuated mostly by men.
.
.

Kiki Mordi, in the light of her experience on sexual abuse, called some men t.r.a.s.h. 

Morayo spoke about paedophilia, and said even husbands should not be trusted.

The FB woman stood against the maltreatment of a prostitute after the customer beat her silly and refused to pay - something like that.
.

These crimes committed were not judged as harshly as the responses from women.
.
.

A man rapes. A woman stands against it.

Patriarchy ensures no one pays attention to the actual crime, but we crucify the audacity of a woman to point out the alarming number of abuse perpetuated by men.

When you - as a woman - point that out, you commit a more heinous crime than the criminal.

Strange world.

The Patriarchy is trying to break Kiki Mordi.

I hope he never succeeds.
