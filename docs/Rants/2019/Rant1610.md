I say I want to leave Nigeria, and some Nigerians are busy yapping about gratitude.

"Joy, but this country has been good to you. You are loved. You thrive. You do what you want. You live above norms. Your children are brilliant. You give them all they want. You travel. You run businesses. You have not aged. It shows how well you have lived..."

Then they add, "If you feel this way about Nigeria, how do you want so-and-so to feel that can barely feed her one child?"
.

Hush already, please.

I don't care about parents who cannot feed one child.

We are not searching for the same things, obviously  

They want food. I want MORE.

I am talking about DISCONTENT. You are talking about poverty.

What's my fvcking business with poverty? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

What is my business with people who are grateful for rice and stew?

I didn't ask to be born. So now I am here, I'm going to go hard as a mudafvcka on all I think I want.

Live the life you want... or go take a nap.
