I was trying to explain to my daughters how frustrating it is working in a low-energy company.

I tried using words, but they didn't get it, so I said...

"Remember the movie, Zootopia?"

"Yes."

"Remember the sloth?"

"Oh! You mean they need ten years to do a day's job?"

I nodded.

They have been laughing for over 15 minutes.

The Boyfriend sent a message during the day to ask how my day was going?

"I'm drowning in my cup of water. Please come save me."

He called immediately he received my response just so he could laugh at me very well.

Thank God for my side business - thank God for scriptwriting that feeds my energy.

And thank God for electricity and potable water and a sane city.

Thank God for everything else...

If not for that, I'd pack my things and go to Mauritius!

Goooooooooooooood niiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.

*takes 20 years to get to the bedroom from the living rooooooooooom*

Sigh.
