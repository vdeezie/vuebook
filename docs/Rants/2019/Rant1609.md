I am not going to have my daughters in any marriage where they negotiate the importance of a car, a washing machine, or a PhD in her life.

These discussions are clearly beneath any child from my womb.

I will not allow my daughters get into Nigerian marriages with the notion that permission needs to be sought to acquire property, travel at will, start a business etc.

I would rather not have my daughters in any Nigerian marriage at all - no matter how good it promises to be.

When that time comes to explain my stance to my girls...

I shall employ mathematical graphs, logarithms, game theory, differential geometry, equations, equilibrium, and complex systems of maths to justify why it is best to stay single if Nigeria is the only option for a spouse.

I will scribble cerebral shit like John Nash on walls and kitchen slabs just so they do not ever think they need to wait on marriage to fulfil important desires like Happiness and Achievement. 

I will break EVERY social construct... I will strip all assumptions about reality to bare bones. 

They will see clearly social constructionism for what it really is.

So help me God.
