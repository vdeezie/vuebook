I also double as a director in client service in the office.

So I'm writing out a list of companies I'll be meeting next week.

My boss has this look on his face.

We address everyone by his/her first name in the office...

So I ask, "What's up with the look?"

"If you go out there, another company will take you. That's for sure," he says with a sense of loss.

I immediately felt a sadness cloud the room. 

This man, after only one meeting, put me on a pedestal I believed I deserved to be... in a country that is not my home.

It's one thing to think you deserve it. It's another thing to meet someone who thinks you deserve it...

And it is entirely different thing to meet someone who gives you what you think you deserve.

My boss ticks all the right boxes. 

He didn't take advantage of my position as a foreigner, ignorant of the corporate culture and terms of engagement in a new land.

He has been GOOD to me. Good is an understatement. 

He has shown me great kindness and respect.
.

I stretch my hand forward on his desk, towards him...

"I will make sure, as much as I humanly can, to treat you and your corporate goals with decency and respect. I will always look out for you."

He smiles. 

We shake hands.

I'm home now.

Let me eat and Netflix. 

It was a great day.
