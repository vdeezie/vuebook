The weirdest thing happened this morning during breakfast.

We went to the hotel restaurant for morning buffet…

There’s soft music playing. The songs are so soft, it’s almost as if they are part of the décor, the ambience.

Then Lionel Richie’s ‘I call it love’ comes on.

I tell my girls that I love this song.

“I love the video even more,” I added.

“Tell us about the video,” Ife said.

So I tell them about Nicole, the star who falls in love with a waiter...

Then I start crying oo!

Hian!

It makes no sense, even to me… because I do not wish to fall in love with a waiter or date down at all!

So why am I crying? And why does it feel so good even though I do not wish to apply that story to my life or anyone’s life?

It’s art. It’s the beauty of creating art – we get to tell stories that are beautiful only through our screens, and we have the power to validate these stories to our audience – even though we do not expect them to apply it to their lives.

The taxi driver falls in love with the Fortune 500 female CEO.

The security guard gets the attention of the billionaire’s daughter.

The bodyguard marries the superstar (we’ve seen this one a few times).

Stuff we love to watch on screen, but would rather not experience in our lives.

This stuff always gets me mushy even if I’d rather be with a totally different kind of man.

Why?

I was wiping tears from my eyes, telling the story about the music.

So we go back to our room after breakfast and I play the video for them on YouTube, and I tear up again.

Whew!

I think it’s the way the shots were directed – crisp and smart, and the song is also very beautiful to listen to.

My girls are just staring at me.

Jolade is unimpressed, she goes back to playing her game on her phone. No emotions betrayed 😂

But Ife kinda understands.

“You are such a hopeless romantic. Deep down you believe in love,” Ife says.

Of course I do! But not with a waiter nah!

I always write stories like this, but I never desire that life for myself.

Dating down is not a thing I admire in real life, but for videos and movies? Ah!!! I live for that shit!

Let’s keep art away from reality, abeg.

Here’s the video and the amazing Lionel Richie.
