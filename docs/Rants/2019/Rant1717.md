Think about this:

You have a smart daughter who did very well in school. Participated in sports, and was part of the students' governing body.

When she becomes an adult, she gets married. 

And when her child falls sick...

This smart daughter of yours who was top in her class, an excellent orator, a brilliant girl...

This daughter who won awards in school would, as an adult, open her mouth and say she is waiting for someone called a "Husband" to decide whether a sick child should be taken to the hospital - or not.

She would wait for an average man to come back from an average work trip before she takes action on a dying child.

Let's forget, for a minute, the personal dreams she gave up... let's focus on how little women apply their brain in marriage.

Apart from making oha soup, dressing up kids for school and fighting side chicks, nothing exceptional happens.

Ah! There's also the endless owambe parties attended by fellow married women who measure their success in life by the crease lines on their husbands' trousers.
.
.

Remember your daughter used to be very smart. 

Now, she can't decide whether to take a sick child to the hospital OR wait for "my husband to make that decision".

This Nigerian marriage that dulls the senses of women is one of the most disgraceful activities in the world. 
.

Train your daughters better than they trained you.

Do better.
