I bought an anklet yesterday 💃

Haq haq haq haq!!! 🤣
.

I was feeling myself until I realised a peculiar sound was following me everywhere.

I would look back to see if anyone was behind me.

It sounded like the ring to a Yoruba deity...

Like the strides of an Òrìṣà.

It took a while to realise I was the one with the sing-song movement. My anklet was jiggling to sounds of my feet.

Shikiri...shikiri...shikiri...shakara... as I walk by.

Damn! My god status finally has a soundtrack 💃💃💃

Sincerely, the motive for buying the anklet was to see how sexy my leg will look whilst hanging on my lover's shoulder as he blesses me 🙈

But the endorsement to my godship with the sweet clang is added blessing, and most welcomed 😁

I love it.

Ah! Shikiri...shikiri...shikiri...shakara! 🤩

I ain't taking this off. Ever!

Feel free to call me Òrìṣà Ọya - the god of wind, fire and magic.

Shikiri...shikiri...shikiri...shakara...

😁😍❤😘
