Reading Paul in the bible was quite confusing.

Dude be like...

"Whatever I am now, I worked really hard for it. I  did it. I worked harder than all the other disciples..."

Then he'll scratch his head and say...

"Not really me sha, na God. Jesus did it for me. He poured his favour on me... But I put in the work sha, I have receipts. Na my work do am for me, but it is still God sha that worked through me..."

He will scratch his head again and say...

"But I nor go lie sha, na me do my work by myself. Anyhoo, na still God go collect dis praise."

And as he makes his way out, he will turn again and say...

"But na me do am."

Dude was on some bipolar shii. He just couldn't tuck that smugness in properly ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
