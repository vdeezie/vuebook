One of my colleagues says he wants to introduce me to his brother. 

"He'll adore a woman like you," he said.

"Describe, in your opinion, a woman like me."

"Smart, beautiful, impressive in many ways, crazy in some ways, full of mystery."

Hmm. Ok. 

So I tell him, "I'm in."

"He's not in Ghana at the moment, but let me show you his picture."

Dude took like 30 minutes. I popped in a few times to ask for it. I was kinda excited, yup!

So he comes to my office and shows me a six-pack belly.

"I thought we should proceed on this note - the fact that he'll appeal to you sexually."

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Ok. Nice. Oya show me his face.

He shows me a full picture. 

Not bad. Not bad at all.

Fine dude, actually. 

"He'll be around in a few weeks," he said.

"Show me his social media activities."

I can deduce a lot from the pictures he posts and the opinions he shares. 

So I see pictures of him chilling, shooting at close range, a few cool sports, necking a chick. 

"Tell him I'm an artist," I said.

"What do you think he'll make of that?" He asked. 

"That's what I'll like to know too."
.

An artist cannot be put in a box. 
I cannot be shamed.
I will not break. 
I will never fit in.
I am all about energy and nothing else. 

I am a creator. Or simply, a god.

I am phoenix.

Period. 

Let's see what he makes of a plain truth. Hopefully the phallus doesn't deflate ðŸ˜Š
