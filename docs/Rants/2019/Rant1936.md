A random new year message:

I wish that you would have the kind of focus, resolve and nonchalance of Miracle Ikechukwu, winner of #BBNaija Season 3.

You know, that level of zero fuckery is good for the soul.

He did not join their WhatsApp group.

He would not attend their reunion party for our entertainment.

He would not be at their events.

He refused to indulge us. To be material for bants.

He refused to be defined by the voyeurism and hedonism of an online crowd that is never satisfied.

He left us to our collective schadenfreude and will not be our clown, our puppet.

He stopped being the property of pop culture after the show.

He already won. 

He won the money. 

Then he won the right to ownership of his life.
.

No long story this new year's morning.

This is the post!
.

Kill the noise. 

Don't join the crowd.

Take ownership of your life, your narrative.
.

I know you were waiting for some deep shit...

Nah! This is the message.

Take what you can from it.
.

May 2020 be grand for those who work for it.

Happy New Year!

❤❤❤
