I'm very arrogant sha!

You know, every time I leave a job, and I eventually tell my mum ("eventually" because it might take months before I inform her casually)...

I always say, "They don't deserve me."
.

This is how it usually goes...

Me: Oh by the way, I resigned. 

Mum: When?

Me: Three months ago.

Mum: Why?

Me: They don't deserve me.

Mum: Hian! Go and work in Norway nah!
.
.

Even with my kids, this is a typical conversation...

Me: Hello, babes. How's school?

Kids: School is fine. How is work?

Me: Oh, I resigned. Didn't I tell you?

Ife: No, you didn't. When did you resign?

Me: A month ago. I could have sworn I told you.

Jolly: No, you didn't. 

Ife: I bet they didn't deserve you, abi?

Me: No, they didn't. 

Kids: OK. Whatever. 

I'm sure when the call is over, they'll roll their eyes and say... "she is so weird".
