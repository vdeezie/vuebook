Iâ€™m trying to book tickets for a stage play showing at Agip Hall for me and my girls this December.

Childrenâ€™s entertainment is negligible in Nigeria, especially for teenagers. You will look under rocks and you still will not find exciting outdoor activities and engagements for your kids.

So Iâ€™ve been racking my brain all week. I have a notepad where I write all the activities I want them to enjoy this holiday â€“ from Lagos to Accra.

We are spending a week in Lagos, so the plan is to go out every day.

What can I say? I want to spoil my babies ðŸ˜€

I have everything from game centres, to race cars to dinner at Eko Signature, booked.

Then I found a stage play that would be showing at Agip Hall during our stay, and I decided to get tickets.

It was difficult finding a number to call. I had to check many platforms online to find a contact number.

I call the numberâ€¦

And the first thing that hit me was that special flavour of Nigerian apathy in his voice.

Here I was, calling with some excitement (as much as I could gather, considering the dayâ€™s sad Nigerian event), and there he was with that who-is-this-one tone of voice.

I didnâ€™t bother with it, I want to believe traffic for the day had crushed the last slice of his enthusiasm.

I asked if this was the number to call to get tickets for the Playâ€¦

I was going to ask if teenagers could see it. I donâ€™t want a serious theme. I just want my daughters to laugh and have some fun. Nothing deep that would depress themâ€¦

But niggaa didnâ€™t even know what I was talking about. He was lost for minutes.

Then he snapped out of his lethargy.

By then, I was already done!

How can you not know the stage play that is showing in just a week's time with your number as the contact?

I ended the call, abeg!
.

This Nigerian anyhowness needs to stop!

Itâ€™s annoying!
.

Live as if it is your last day. Live with enthusiasm, damn it!

I know Nigeria is a latrine, but you canâ€™t let it take the joy from a simple call, on the phone, about a business that is supposed to pay you!

Itâ€™s a waste of space to be alive and be so inactive.

You just sit there and vegetate.

How can you be so dead when you are alive? 

Hian!

PS: Please anyone with ideas and suggestions on how I can fill up my notepad with fun activities for me and my girls - from Lagos to Accra, kindly holler! My iin
