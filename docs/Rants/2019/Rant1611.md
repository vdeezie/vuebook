I find Daenerys to be annoying and irritating.

You had three dragons.

Three!

You lose one to the White Walkers...

You let dead creatures ravage another one at some point...

You make no strong impact with THREE DRAGONS!!!

With all the resources at your disposal - the kind of resources nobody else has... you still could not be great to the level expected of someone with that much resources.

She could have been anything with those dragons - anything!

Yet she is just another pretty face.

She has no real leadership skills. 

But she has dragons. And for that reason we pay her some attention. YET, she could not transcend to a higher calling.

She gets on my nerves, walahi!

It got even worse when she met and fell in love with Jon Snow.

Now she's just a puppy, playing dragon games with the man whose preeq she likes.

Wehdone, hanty.
.

The real hero would be a woman without a dragon. The woman without resources, who still fights and conquers.

Give those dragons to Cersei and watch what happens to the entire plot.

That's what we are here for.

If you've got the resources, become what is required of you.

What does Arya Stark have that has made her a god - nothing... except talent and grit.

There are women... and there are women.
