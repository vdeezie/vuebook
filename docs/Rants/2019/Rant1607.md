Parenting tip #01
.

In the cinema hall...

When you are there with your kids, get seats at the end of the aisle.

Don't leave your children in the dark of an auditorium sitting next to a stranger.

No. No.

Parents always want to take the last seat on the aisle.

That seat isn't yours. It's for your kid(s).

Switch seats!

Sit in the position that shields your kids from others.

Always keep them in a position less vulnerable. 

Always.
