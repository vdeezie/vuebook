I've spent 2,000 cedis today.

What did I buy?

Nothing.

Well, not really - I topped my electricity. With the girls around, we'll probably have four airconditioners on at once. 

I bought an extra bedsheet. And other bric-a-brac. 

That's it.

2,000 ghc gone, just like that!

It's painful because the currency has value.

We spend N100k in Lagos within hours, buying nonsense in Ebeano supermarket, and we don't complain. E nor dey pain.

Value vs. Valueless.
.

I stopped buying Clarins in Accra... because I'd rather see a debit of N198,000 on my phone than receive 3,000 cedis debit. 

It's the same damn thing, but naira nor dey pain.

We buy bedsheets for N25k. But I've been grumbling to myself that this 315 cedis bedspread is expensive. 

Mindset.

Money wey nor get value nor dey pain.

See naira. See trash.
