SMH.

Women don't understand how disadvantaged they are.

South African women are supporting their men for setting human beings on fire.

When these men are done burning Nigerians...

They will come for YOU.
.

We read the news, dears. We read your news. 

They cut off your arms. They burn you with acid. They slice half your face off.

These are men. Men you support when they turn their wrath to some other twisted cause. 

But it's only for a minute...

They will return to you to do what they do best...

Misogyny.

Where will you run to then?
.
.

I talked about parts of Mona Eltahawy's book some years ago...

Egypt fought their leaders as a united group, men and women stood with one voice...

After they defeated the ruling class, these same men who fought for a better society, turned around to rape their women as part of the victory.
.

Stop taking sides with these men.

Stop fueling their power.

Stand for ideologies instead. And when ideologies are met...

Run the fvck away!

You are not special. Misogyny will come for you too.
.

You are going to be a victim over and over and over again if you stand with people you know are wired to hurt you.

People who take full advantage of their privilege to bully, mock, scorn, abuse and judge you are s.c.u.m.

Enough of being intentional about weakness that begs for a man's attention. 

Be wise.
