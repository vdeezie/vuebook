There's this client we have...

Every time we go to her office, she looks at me for long minutes and says...

"You are beautiful. You look really nice."

'Thank you," I'd reply 

Then she'd ignore me for the rest of the meeting, talking and addressing only the men.

I'm always like... grrrrrrrr! Da fvck!
.
.

She gives me 5 minutes of compliment, and then turns to the men and address them for one hour or more.

She calls all the men by name...

Do you know how she addresses me?

She'd look at my boss and say:

"Just like your pretty woman said the other time..."

Your. Pretty. Woman.

This sexism from another woman is strong fa!

WTF!

If only she knew me.

I'm so bored I don't even bother to exert myself or prove her wrong.

Gone are the days I'll jump in the middle of a conversation to prove I am intelligent, or prove my abilities to deliver and deliver well.

I still get to be the one to strategize her creative work when we return to the office anyway.

I draw your creative direction and ideas in 24 hours.

But go ahead and reduce me to "your pretty woman".

I can't even be bothered.

Maybe I should file my nails at the meeting next time she calls.
