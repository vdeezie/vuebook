I don't want to be indoors on weekends.

Ghana is too lovely to spend alone (at least the Accra life I have created for myself).

Dear universe, hear me...

I know there are more loud-mouthed men, grabbing on to the tenets of patriarchy, pretending to be respectful of women just to  be counted as woke, but won't skip a beat to troll and shame...

In all of this mess called life, kindly reserve one decent man for me.

I am horny as fvck. Hot as fvck. And I want to spend this moment of my life with someone who lusts after everything that I am - my mind, my body, my soul... and I lust right back.

Equal lust.
Equal love.
Equal desire to commit.
Equal understanding of zero marital discussion. 
Equal hunger to explore our bodies and minds.
Equal need for adventure.

I always seem to get what I want.

So here I am speaking without fear or shame...

I want a good man that makes me want to tear my bra right from the door.

I want sex and obsession.

I want a lover in all the ways love can be expressed.

A man who has his shit together.

Make it happen, dear cosmic.

It's your girl,

JIB.
