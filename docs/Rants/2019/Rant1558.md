The lady who made a video of Success, the little girl sent home for owing school fees, is demanding compensation.

She is aware they have made "alot of money" from the video, and would like them to show financial appreciation.

"If they have made N5million, at least they should show me appreciation with N1m. That is not too much."

We have no shame. 

The entitlement!!! The contemptible prerogative!!!

Viral videos happen. The rewards are just as much a shock to the beneficiaries as it is to everyone else.

The most important thing is setting the child's Trust Fund, not poor wretched people sharing money!

Be gone, please!

If I could, I would choose never to speak to a typical Nigerian for the rest of my life.

And that includes those ones who shame an investigative reporter for doing her job and calling it jealousy or something-something political envy.

Thankfully, I have cleansed myself of the remnants of that clique. Like washing my hands after cleaning a dusty surface.

I care not for what you are. 

This country with all its riches, all its poverty... all the daft people, all its brilliant people writing big-big grammar.

All of you/us, nothing. 

You might as well be froth on a bathroom tile.

You are nothing. 

You stand for nothing.

Froth.
