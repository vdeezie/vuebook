I got over 20 calls today, and 8 offers.

8 offers that were willing to start almost immediately!

I turned down seven, because I am fully becoming a filmmaker, and definitely not interested in branding Nigerian celebrities.

I don't need the distraction.

But here’s the lesson:

I made recommendations, but they all said if I wasn’t available to take the offer, they are fine with the people they already have.

They all said this.

One added, “I am only going to change my team if I can have you on board, if not then I’m fine with my team as it is.”

People are looking for the exception. Everyone is bored with average – even in Nigeria, the country that loves mediocrity.

I didn’t want the offers, yet they wouldn’t accept my recommendations, because if it isn’t panadol, e nor fit be the same thing as panadol (I know. I know. Cheesy as fvck 😂)

If you are a writer, write!

Let people read you!

Write with fire and blood.

Stop pandering to the psyche of plebeians.

Do not be afraid of being dragged.

By jove! I love being dragged!! I love it!!!

Drag me, fvcking plebieans! Drag me!! Yas!

I read all the shit and it swells my already inflated ego.
 
I love it! All of it!

Bake me a fvcking cake! Bake it, hater baker! Yas!

Stop being afraid of writing your truth.

I have told many writers that being good is not good enough – you have to be dangerous.

You have to hit the bull’s eye.

In a sea of words, your piece has to stand out.

I am not the only one who has written about Tacha and Teebillz. But when I did, they trended both their names on Twitter, and my post gathered 20,000 likes on IG and 4,000 comments. It is all over blogsphere.

Do not be afraid to write, and I mean really write.

Let them abuse your family and your ancestors. Yo! It doesn't mean jack!

These people ain't shit. They are one giveaway from licking a con man's as*hole.

The most beautiful thing about good writing is: the people who are meant to see it, will see it and things will begin to happen.

I told you about Mary Njoku. I have always admired her. But it was she who finally reached out to me.

Why?

Because I wrote a series she liked - for someone else oo!

She got my number and called me.

They are probably 30 writers sending her DMs that she'll never read.

Phew.

Write with sense. Write with a bit of bougie, a bit of gangsta, and a bit of danger.

But most importantly, write with no fucks given.

Write.

Don't just copy and paste. That is not a career. 

If you want to make money and earn respect and the oh-so delicious hate...

WRITE, damn it! Write!

Today is a miracle 🙏
