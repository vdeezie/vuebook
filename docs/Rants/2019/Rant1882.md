I told The Boyfriend this morning…

“Whenever I look at the world through your eyes, it is so colourful and so beautiful.”

He smiled and kissed me.

It’s true.

When we travelled to Dubai last year… my goodness! The experience was breathtaking!!

The fine dining, the places we visited, the gifts, the endless shopping, the sites and scenes, the walks we took – everything was magical.

The same thing happened in Abu Dhabi. Whenever I experience life with him, it’s always full of colours!

When I went to Dubai with the kids, I couldn’t navigate that city at all. I was lost half the time 😂😭😭
It was a different experience without him (though the kids had fun).
.

Even in The Gambia. I bet the resort was gorgeous because he was there.

His flair for details and his exquisite taste add to the beauty of life as he presents it to me. He makes every experience extraordinary.
.

London nko? Even though we were both in a mood, the moments he spent with me (before heading to Belgium or Denmark?) were memorable. 

We took the train. He made me run after the train. We were laughing like teenagers in love 😂😍

(Gosh! I'm crying! 😊)

I sit back every other week and I recall those moments and I tear up, for real. My eidetic memory allows me to relive these experiences over and over again. They keep my heart warm.

I am loved. Truly, I am.

All of 2018, I was a headache to this man, I didn’t love him right.

But if you ask him, he’d say he didn’t think I loved him any less than I could love him at that time.

A king!
.

This morning, he hired this really fancy SUV and we were chauffeured around places that were so beautiful, I smiled.

This is my city, yet he comes and shows me places I haven’t yet seen. He takes me to dine in places that leave me in awe.

How does he do it, fam?
.

Then he says, “I can’t wait for our vacation. Sorry we haven’t had any this year so far. Work has been crazy. But I promise to make up for it."

Ah bless! 😊

I smile because I know that my entire life in Accra feels like a vacation ❤
