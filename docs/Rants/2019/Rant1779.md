How come nobody has accused FBI of "bitterness" against Invictus Obi? 🤔

I mean... isn't this "premeditated wickedness" on the part of the Bureau? 🧐

Shouldn't we tell the FBI to go and "catch political elites" and leave Obiwanne alone?🤨

Shouldn't the FBI go "do something else with their time" and leave Obi?

Ehn?

After all he "didn't kill anybody" 🤷🏽‍♀️
