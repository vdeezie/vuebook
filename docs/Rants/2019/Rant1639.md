Nigerians believe they can succeed IN SPITE OF Nigeria. 

They don't care to align their realities to the economic indicators that show that Nigeria is barely growing at 2% this year!

We are in a crisis. 

No faith is strong enough to save you as a people. 

A few people will succeed, no doubt. Because a bad economy can only make room for a few.

The sky is not big enough.

Your hearts will continue to break. Things are not working in that country. 

Your faith is too small to make a difference. 

And God is bored.

We remind Him of the servant who buried 10 silver and returned it to the master without profit. 

But that is me sounding rich. In our case as Nigerians, we returned decayed money.

We are a tragedy. And our optimism is irresponsible. 

We have ruined every industry, every institution. 

We produce nothing, except a group of optimistic dreamers.

We are Romantics - unrealistic and starry-eyed. 

Nigeria is a quixotic project. 

And its believers who believe for just the heck of believing, are going to get so broken, it'll be too painful to watch. 

I'm sorry in advance ðŸ’”
