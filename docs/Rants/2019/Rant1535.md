Dear Facebook Users, do kindly note...
.

People are allowed to have fictional online personas.

These fictional personas are allowed to have online conversations with real people.

These fictional personas are allowed to ask real people out on e-dates.

These fictional personas do not have to reveal who they are (duh! That's why they are fictional, dunderhead).

And also, these fictional personas are allowed to ask for nu*des.
.
.

The question should be...

YOU, the real person, what the f*ck are you doing dating a fictional character?

Not everytime play the victim. 

Sometimes, use your f*cking head!

I am so sick of this 'One man vs. 20 women' stories of victimhood. 

Get out of here, please.

You have a brain. 

The way you apply that brain to pass your exams, get a job... the way you apply the brain to jump bus, fry plantain and wash your bathroom tiles...

It is the same way you should apply the brain in relationships with men - real or fictional.

This is 2019.

You are not victims.

These men are not even smart.

You are just stupid. 

Aargh!!!

PS: This is your fault, Idem. See what you made me dig up from the daft corners of Facebook ðŸ˜­
