Finally, home!

Oh! I didn't go with the other house anymore.

"Wait till it rains," Emilia said.

And when it did rain, there were no roads left for cars to drive!

Red mud followed me around. I didn't even know where they came from! üòÇ

The landlord wasn't so keen on a Nigerian tenant, so it was easy to get money back.

I've seen 15 houses since then. 

I finally made my choice - a furnished apartment in a nice neighbourhood and tarred roads, 7 minutes from my office.

How cool is that?! üòä

This place costs a lot more, but after selling off my household electronics and items in Lagos in two homes (Festac and Lekki), and also office electronics and furniture in one of my offices, there's no way in hell I was going to a new country and start shopping for stuff. 

Nah!

I had to think about it really hard.

Do not own too many things at first until you get everything you want.

Makes sense?

This has three bedrooms, two toilets, two bathrooms... and spaaaaaace to last for days.

Phew!

I love it.

PS: I'll take better pictures later. I'm late for a strategy meeting. 

See you later, alligators!
