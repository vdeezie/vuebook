Toke Makinwa says you should deliberately disrupt your partner’s life, then send naked pictures afterwards to spice up his day just around the time he is about to lose his mind.

And everybody is losing their minds about something so fictional, very un-Nigerian, and totally impractical.

Which Nigerian man will fall for this kind of crap? None!

So what’s the angst about?

When has Nigerian men made any decision, other than sex, based on naked pictures? When has being a dumb binsh put Nigerian men in a position of indecision or cluelessness?

That is not how patriarchy works.

These things don’t even work around here, so relax. The niggaa probably has three girlfriends and a wife, anyway.

Listen, this is Patriarchy. Men are never going to lose out on sex, love, lust and relationships. Never.

Men always have a better chance of ending up with the kind of woman they want. And if it doesn’t work for them, they can always get another.

Stop feeling sorry for men. They are fine. Their father – the Patriarchy – is alive and well.
.

Patriarchy humbles women for sport.

These men have been told that they are the prize. They have been the prize since the days of our great grandfathers and beyond.

A little silly bant from Toke doesn’t change the plot. It’s just bants.

Because this same Toke will beg that niggaa if he doesn’t respond to that naked picture in 30 minutes!

The reason I laugh about what women say and how they plan to react in relationships in Nigeria is because women do not have the power to shift or change the collective narrative.

I would be more offended if it was a man, creating road blocks for his partner because men have the power, the permission, and the backing of patriarchy to meet their wishes.

I am 90% certain Toke doesn’t play like that – even if she wants to – because there’s no Nigerian man to play that rough play with.

If a Nigerian man wants a cook for a wife, he gets a cook for a wife.

If he wants a slay queen for a wife, he can get a slay queen – at the cheapest rate – for a wife.

If he wants a quiet home, he can negotiate for that.

Too much power. To much privilege, prepped and creamed by women!

 A woman doesn’t get what she wants easily. And none of her bat shit crazy ideas will come true.

And if it does come true, then that niggaa is the remnant of a meteor that burns itself out while shooting hot and dry in the sky 🤷🏽‍♀️

You can't suffer under-development and then suffer the infantile antics of a lover.

Throw the baby and the bath water away!
.

Bottom line: Toke shouldn’t represent anything to you other than edited slay pictures on the gram. And of course, a good attempt at bag business.

PS: And really, should you be sending nudes to Nigerian men or women?! 

Tsk tsk.
