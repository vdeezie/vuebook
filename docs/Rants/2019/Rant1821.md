I saw a line of tweets from one woman.

This is what her page looks like...

2 days ago:
I'm going to bed and I don't want to wake up.

24 hours ago:
Tired. So tried. 

18 hours ago:
I need to stop crying and pick myself up.

10 hours ago:
I hope I'm not a burden to you.

6 hours ago:
I don't know how to put back the fire in my soul. 

5 hours ago:
I need to get back up.
.
.
.

Then all of a sudden, she tweets...

1 hour ago:
My husband will never wake up and not find his coffee or tea ready. I'll wake up extra early to make pancakes if he wants. Feminists/liberals die in your rage.
.

Haq haq haq haq haq haq! 😂😂😂

See ehn, pick-mes are mentally deranged.

What these women do is sick. 

They give their backs to Patriarchy and say...

"Flog me until my back is sore. Punish me until I bleed."

"Why?" Patriarchy asks.

"Because I want feminists to be angry and frustrated."

🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
.

I mean... you are the one getting flogged and punished. 

How do you think that affects another woman vacationing in Paris?

Bend your backs and take your whips. Submit to Patriarchy if you wish. 

The real feminists know how to demand power and freedom from the same system you allow to oppress you.

Stay oppressed. 

We are living our dreams. 

Toh.

*PS: I'd rather not be identified as a feminist for reasons I have stated many times. 

I am not here for labels.

I am here for freedom.
