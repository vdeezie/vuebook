This is what happens when you have too many friends... when you are afraid of rocking the boat... when you have to always be diplomatic because of the fear of losing friends... when you always try to "balance things" so you don't hurt anyone. You begin to sound like a mosquito.

This is what happens when we get used to always covering the smell of shit with cologne.

Comedians make nasty, rude, uncouth, loud, derogatory jokes about rape and women all the damn time. They shame women, they attack them verbally, they drag, they build businesses around misogyny...

Yet, this is what your "African Rapper Number 1" has to say about the Netflix expos√© on comedy. 

This is how we tackle all our social, cultural and political problems in Nigeria. Always afraid to say the truth with your chest.

A "weak" man is a terrible thing.

It is not everything that requires tact. Some things are so appalling, they should be condemned outrightly without fear or shame.

You cannot "stand with comedians right to joke about anything", you moron! There's no "funny" in rape.

There's nothing remotely humorous about rape.

This society sickens me.
