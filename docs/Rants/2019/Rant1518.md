They invited me to a bourgeois WhatsApp group to be part of a weekend hangout.

And I have already "fought" with two persons. I am a problem, aswear 🤷🏽‍♀️

Private house theatre viewing of Tyler Perry's Acrimony.

Ok.

I say I don't want to hang out to see Tyler Perry's movie, Acrimony. Or any Tyler movie for that matter. I'll pass until the next bourgeoisie hangout.

Then you start quizzing me on "why" 🙄

You go on to praise Tyler and his creativity. And at that point, I am thinking I don't belong here. I definitely do not belong in any group - bourgeoisie or not, that thinks Tyler Perry is creative🤧

But you don't stop. You want to know why I would not want to hang out and watch Acrimony🤕

Is it by force? There are up to 20 persons in the group. If one person is feeling like she's all that and too fly for Tyler Perry, ignore her and focus on the others. Abi?🤷🏽‍♀️

But nooooo! You are slightly offended that I think what you picked for adults to gather and watch is a movie way down the line of creativity. And you continue poking for reasons why I don't want to hang and see Acrimony. 

Niggaa! I can't be wasting my time on elementary storytelling, and then a lenghty discussion on matrimony with 20+ Nigerians with wine and chops afterwards.

I know where you all stand on the matter, pretentiously, and I'll just be sour grapes in your mouth with my truth.

See ehn, my life is simple.

I was gisting 'The Boyfriend' last night and he laughed and said...

"People don't understand that the only things you like are Work and Vacation. Your worth comes from Work. And your peace comes from Vacations."

"I like money too," I smiled.

"Nah. You don't like money. You want to believe you do because it is a trending conversation, but deep down you don't care."

Hian!

I changed the topic immediately 💅💅💅
