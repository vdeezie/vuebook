One time, The Boyfriend invited a friend to join us for dinner at Wheatbaker hotel.

"Be careful what you say, she's a writer," he said when his friend arrived.

The man laughed.

"I'm serious! Everything you say, how you act - how you lift your fork, the smirk on your face - everything is content, everything is a story. And she has a very good following. Behave."

"Wow," the friend gasped, "Are you content too?" He asked The Boyfriend.

"Yup. But I'm a good man, so it's all good content. Great for my ego," he smiled.

And I was like... "I don't know what he's talking about, I'm a good geh," 😁🤷🏽‍♀️😂😂#Rant1768
