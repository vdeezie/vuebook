When we were young, we were told to finish our meals... 

For the sake of the hungry children on the streets.

In essence, stuff your bellies with food as a way of disgracing poverty that you will not experience IJN.

ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„

Many people's journey to obesity started from this childhood rule of eating every morsel of eba and every grain of rice as a show of gratitude.
.

Thank God for brewing rebellion since I was 5.

I will not finish my food. Period. 

You don't add weight as a sign of honour to the anorexic. 

You do not eat to acknowledge poverty in someone else's life.

You do not harm yourself as a way of sharing in someone else's pain.

Food is not meant to be finished. 

And quite frankly, leftovers are for dogs, not humans.
.

"See all the food you want to waste. Think about the hungry families out there," mothers would say.

"If they come, I can share it with them. But they are not here. I refuse to eat for an entire hungry family that I know nothing about," we would respond. 

Simple. 

Life is bigger than the stomach.

Your plate of unfinished meal might have meant something significant in the days of Moses...

But this is 2019.

It's not that deep.
