One of the most ridiculous things I heard in my life was when someone shared the story of a medical specialist who came for an event, had a profound session...

Then left in a KIA car afterwards.

🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

He was offended that a man so knowledgeable and skilled in his field doesn't drive a Lamborghini.

🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

Does driving a Toyota or KIA invalidate you as a human being? Does it reduce the impact of your contribution to humanity?

I couldn't laugh, of course, but I just thought this was the dumbest thing I had to hear that day.

And they say these things with so much passion and conviction.

Phew!

I am here to remind y'all that a doctor should never be a hustler...

Else he would lie that you have glaucoma and feed off this lie for years from different clients.

Do you know how much glaucoma drugs cost?

I have been treating a disease I didn't have for more than five years, because we continue to tell people to "Hustle oo!".

If a society shames specialists for living decent, civil lives... then specialists will tell you how easy it is to "hustle" and make more money off you.

Take your father to the doctor, let him diagnose a degenerative disease, since we all want to be mad.

Do you know how many people are treating diseases they don't have because you expect a medical specialist to own a Bugatti?

How can you not see how ridiculous y'all sound?

My kids are back to school after the midterm break.

The Boyfriend made it back in time from South Africa to drive them back to school.

I am at peace because the teachers and carers of the school are not hustlers!

Imagine if they were mocked for driving affordable cars or no cars at all.

Imagine a life where we continue to tell teachers to hustle.

Imagine what will happen to our children!

I am here again to remind you that there are more important things than flamboyant wealth OR the pursuit of flamboyant wealth...

Medicine and Education.

No matter how much you have, no matter what you say...

You are still beneath a DOCTOR and a TEACHER.

The world remains because of knowledge and science.

Now, sit down and be humble!
