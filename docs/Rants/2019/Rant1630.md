Staying at Oriental hotel.

Because I must preserve my sanity wherever I go.

I did a presentation today in Ghana, before my flight. 

The prospect wanted only media placements at first...

Until I spoke.

Now we have the entire brief to come up with creative ideas for YouTube, social media, billboards, TV, radio and brochures.

I mean... the whole shebang!

And it's up to me to write the entire creative brief.

My boss gave me a hi-five.

"Wow. You are brilliant."

I smiled, "I know."

He wants it in two weeks. 

"That's too long," I said. "You'll get it in four days."

It's not like I'm cooking egusi soup for anybody. Why would I need two weeks to write a creative brief? 🤷🏽‍♀️

On to the next immediately, plix.

I love being an intrapreneur.
