I've got two new seasons of City Crimes to write...

I've got two seasons of a hot new TV series to write...

I've got a movie script...

Two movie scripts, actually. 
.

I've got a reality show and a series to come up with for a client...

I've got a day job.

I've got my online Masterclass for scriptwriting and directing with over 300 classes left...

I've got two wonderful daughters...

I've got a lover...

I'm busy.

And I'm never retiring.

Ever.
.

My art is enough. 

It has crowned me with glory. 

It was there when I strayed... it waited patiently for me to return. 

"I am enough for you," says God.

My Art. My God.
