My neighbours are fighting. 

I can't be too sure, but I heard the woman say...

"You fvcked her. I will show you."

She's screaming at the top of her lungs, her voice penetrating my walls... and I'm trying to write a romantic scene in a script with a lot of sex in it.

I'm not sure if it is the fvck I'm writing about OR she actually said fvck.

I heard it too many times for it to be my imagination. 
.

I hate lousy, angry, cantankerous neighbours.

I didn't pay for an expensive apartment to have neighbours give a damn about cheating. 

That's so razz....so 2000-and-late.

Nobody cares.

I need neighbours with a bit more finesse on how they handle a tragicomedy.

This apartment is not cheap, please don't give me a headache. The range-rovers in the building should count for something. 

Approach your problems with grace.

Or you can go and cheat too nah! Abi?

Or carry the fight to the side chick's house. Anything you see for there, na you sabi.

Don't disturb us here.

Nobody cares. 

Nobody!

Let us hear word, abeg!

I'm trying to write a love story for a client. 

Signed,
Yours pretentious bourgeois.
