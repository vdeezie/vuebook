# Rant1780


August 27, 2019

Yesterday, I was staring at the walls in my office.

I got there late and tried to dodge many meetings.

I couldn't work. I even brought my side business along (my final draft), but I couldn't write more than two scenes of a series.

During a brainstorm session I was fatigued, so I left and sat in my office, reclined in my chair and stared at the wall.

My boss came in and said...

"Our queen, everything is going to be OK."

I smiled, "Thank you."
.
.

If I could meet a therapist, the type that listens... I would.

If she (preferably a woman) says one quote from the Bible, I might slap her.

It's not a Bible problem as much as it is an African interpretation problem.

And I will not have that.
.

The next best thing to therapy is to Rant.

And I do that very well already with a strong audience of 53,000+ people.
.

But I want to specially thank the people I let into my space, the people I love to hear from...

Bola, Idem, Prisca, Sylph, Adefunke, Mima, Ify Celine, Yvonne Nwanjibuife, Teetee, Charles Iyoha, Tosin Olukuade, Panda Tomiwa, Sir Emeka Nwogu, Olaide Wangai, Chichi Eriobu, Izedonmi Precious, Victor Ibeh... and others.

You have enriched my life with your constant support and cheering.

My healing comes from you. 

Thank you for the years we have shared on this platform that remains kind and respectful.

At this point, I have to announce that...

I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

Bwahahahahahahhahahaha!!!😂😂😂

Love you, all.

Have a good day 😁😘❤🙏
