This child made me call all the departments in the school today because she dropped Yoruba in SS2 without properly informing me. 

I've been on the phone for HOURS, trying to get this shit straight.

I mean, who does that? You just wake up one morning, at the start of a new session, and decide to make decisions like an adult.

Kid, you don't get to do that when my money is involved. Wait till you're 21.

And she's there feeling cool.

She will copy all the notes of 7 weeks and do the test she missed.
.

I've told these children again and again...

You have a mother like me, take advantage of it for your greater success.

I can fix just about anything.

Not many kids have this. You have ME. WTF!

She gon' learn.

7 weeks note to copy! Ntor!
.

I legit told her...

"I am in Accra, living the life I want. Guess who gets to suffer for not consulting with me? YOU, hun. Now go back to that Yoruba class and eat that humble pie." ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

E pain am ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
.

Next time, holler at your mother.

I know things.
