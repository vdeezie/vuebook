Women insisting on money in relationship is, primarily, fortification against attack.

As long as men use sex as a tool for mockery after a relationship is over...

Women will use money as a tool to get back at men and shut them up.
.

For instance...

A man goes on and on and on subbing an Ex...

All she needs to do, in many cases, is remind him of the expensive gifts he bought, the comfort he provided, or the money he gave when sex was happening between them. 

Simple mathematics. 
.

If an act as delicious as sex will be used to shame you... then show no mercy.

If some men don't stop being jerks, they will be responded to like jerks. 

This is elementary studies.
.
.

I personally have experienced this. 

And when I mocked him with money he provided, sense entered his coconut head. 
At least for a minute. These fools always go back to their original form - half coward, half asshole.

Patriarchy makes men act like assholes.

Guess what? Women can be assholes too. 

Stop shaming women. Period.

Truth is, many relationships can end respectfully, but some men do not want to leave their Exes with any atom of respect.

They want to strip women of dignity.
.

Women, if this happens to you, fight back!

Give as much as you get.

There's no shame to sex.

Let the world hear it!

This is 2019, and there is no shame to sex.
.

So if you want women to value you as a human  being regardless of your money or lack of it... then value women after sex, when a relationship is over.

Capisce?

We can all live in harmony. The gender pronounced as "superior" for centuries should lead the way. 

Or not.#Rant1756
