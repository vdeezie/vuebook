Hi dudes, here's a relationship hack for you:

If you want to get away with misogyny and disrespect...

If you want to be an emotional abuser...

Do not date strong women.

We are the absolute worst!

We don't believe in "God will judge". We don't believe in Karma. 

We will drag you!

Azinn... draaaaaag you!
.
.

See, you can get away with bad behaviour. You really can. 

If that's your thing, there's a type for you.

They will make excuses for you until their last breath.

They are not pick-mes, per se. I mean, you don't have to go that low.

There are women who are very flexible - you know, feminism lite princesses.

Stick to those ones. They will never give you what you truly deserve - that punch to your face. 
They balance on one leg, hoping after all they have uncovered of your hate, you may still love them.
They will love you regardless of whatever info on disrespect pops up in their space.
.

But you see these strong women?

We are like lions, we will drag that zebra until its stripes disappears and blood appears everywhere. Then the feast will begin.

YOU are the feast.

We are carnivores. 
.

So patriarchal kings, date wisely. 

Stay the hell away from strong women. 
.

Don't say I never did anything good for you.
