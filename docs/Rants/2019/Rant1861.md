OK let's do this...

The spelling is Jewellery, if you were colonized by The British. 

But if you're feeling like an American citizen, you can write Jewelry. 

It is not called Jewelleries or Jewelries.

I see some crazy attempt to make "jewelries" acceptable, even on Google. 

It shall not prevail.

Jewelries is razz. It's so ghetto. Like something an area boy would say. 

"Hanty, comot your jewelries oo! Night don come. Shine your eye. File!" 🤷🏽‍♀️

Stop, I beg you!

Jewellery has no plural.

Ugh!
.
.

I would rather just stick to British English, however it is so messed up these days because we all just write however we like.

For instance, that "colonized" up there should come with "s" not "z".

"S" is British English.
"Z" is everybody else.

Respect your slave masters, plis.

Neighbour. Colour. Favour. Labour.

But Americans have "U" for breakfast. So you would find them spelling these differently...

Neighbor. Color. Favor. Labor.

Unnecessary rebellion, if you ask me 🤷🏽‍♀️
.
.

The trick is, you can swing both ways, but you have to be consistent. Be committed to one style for an entire post, then feel free to move to another style for a different post. 

You're either going to write like an American, or respect the Queen and write like The British. 

Don't mix-and-match, plis dear. 

"The neighbour bought a piece of jewelry." ❌

No, dear!

"The neighbour bought a piece of jewellery." ✔

All British spelling.

Or you can write...

"The neighbor bought a piece of jewelry." ✔

All American spelling.

You gerrit?

This is social media, so it's not that deep.

Except "Jewelleries".

Jewelleries is deep.

If you write or say "jewelleries or jewelries", you will burn in hell for it.
