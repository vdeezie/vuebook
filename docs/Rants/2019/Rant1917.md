I went to the gym tonight.

I wanted to burn all the cake and jollof rice from yesterday's enjoyment. 

Tomiwa brought Champagne and it is still brewing around my waist 😂
.

So I get to the gym, and the place is as quiet as a grave yard. 

Not a single soul.

It doesn't help that the gym is far removed from the activities around the hotel.

It's a well-equipped isolated haven for anyone who hasn't watched as many Crime and Investigation TV as I have.

I kept looking back... I swore I heard footsteps... did someone just cough....did the door just open...

8 minutes on the treadmill and I had imagined all the worst scenarios that could possibly take place in this isolation.

One simple decision to work out can ruin a beautiful Christmas break oo!

My heart is beating fast. 

12 minutes later, I leave the place.

.

My waist is still round, but ayam alive.

My imagination will not let me work out in peace. 

"What if a muscular man walks in and..."

"What if someone is hiding behind the..."

"What if..."

"What if..."
.

Ah! Abeg! 

Na fat I don fat, I nor kee person.
.

PS: I am walking around the hotel now. They will soon run up to me to tell me to go inside the gym and walk on the treadmill.

😂😂😂
.

I will take care of jollof rice and Champas settled in different parts of my gorgeous body by morning when it is impossible to be all alone at a gym.

Good night 😁
