OMG! 

So I just watched a pitch on Dragons' Den...

A professor created a car security app that can start a car and control all the features in a car. 

It's a smart gadget that is meant to curb car theft. So with his phone, and away from the car, he can rev the engine, play music, flash the lights etc.

I was impressed.

But then the Dragons came down heavily on him.

Firstly, it is easier to lose your phone than lose your car keys, one of the dragons stated. Stats show he is correct.

Secondly, what if the phone battery dies, how does one start the car? Another dragon asked.

Thirdly, why would anybody want to give an app the liberty to control their car when apps go through more security problems than a simple car key! Another dragon stated.

Whew!

He was asking for Â£200,000. He left with no money. A whole professor! ðŸ˜‚

I love Dragon's Den! It has all the elements of business savvy conversations, and the seriousness of entrepreneurship, and good dose of entertainment.

It is so deliciously rude and vulgar... they have stacks of pounds on their side tables!

And once in a while, they flip the notes like game cards... and my heart skips! ðŸ˜‚

The sheer suspense!

People lose their opportunities for investment just by saying the wrong thing OR not pitching with enough enthusiasm.

I have always believed in enthusiasm. 

It is what we lack, majorly, in Nigeria. 

We have no zest for life. No zing for our aspirations.
