Think about this:

1.

I met two women when I came to Accra.

One is a loud feminist.

The other does not identify as a feminist.

The feminist madam treated me with disdain, withdrew all the assistance she bragged she could fulfill and wasted my time.

The one who doesn't identify as a feminist has saved me over and over and over again in Accra. 

Feminist did nothing, yet she accused me of being entitled just so she could get her clueless gang to react. 

They did.

I blocked all of them and their dogs with the speed of light. 

I'm still blocking. 

That is how disgusted I feel.
.
.

2.

I met two men in Lagos. 

One is a woke feminist. 

The other does not identify as a feminist.

When the relationship with feminist dude ended, he used every thing he could find - even my age - to shame me.

I mean, if age is a thing to be ashamed of, he obviously has no plans to live very long. 

If I wasn't as strong as I am, that niggaa would have destroyed me. 

It was his only goal at some point. 

He even brags about breaking women for sport.

A feminist o!
.

The one who doesn't identify as a feminist is The Boyfriend.

But you all are e-witnesses to the awesomeness of this man.

He literally, single-handedly raised me from ashes.
.
.

My point is:

Labels and pins mean nothing. 

They embellish your outfit, but they don't pierce deep enough to fix a rotten soul.

Look beyond the frills. 

Look beyond "woke".#Rant1808
