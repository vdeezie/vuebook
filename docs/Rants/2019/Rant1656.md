Have you ever been in a meeting with a group of men as they banter in baritone, and chuckled to yourself...

"I have bigger balls than all of them put together."

Balls represent grit. 
Balls represent good ol' intellect. 
Balls represent creativity and wit. 
Balls represent the can-fucking-do spirit. 

Yea. I feel that way all the time.

Patriarchy, culture and social constructionism be saving people since 19-giridim.

PS: This was yesterday's after-work picture. I was wearing this dress for the second time since I bought it in 2017.

Time passes... but my body gets hotter 🤷🏽‍♀️

Still fits like a glove.
