Six weeks ago I was employed as a Creative Strategist in Accra 💃

I came with a lot of burning passion 🔥

I can easily pick out areas that needed restructuring 📈

I was doing boss lady upandan, spreading my fire for all to catch and be lit☀️

*Yawn*

Last week, I announced to management team that I'd rather be a baby girl 👒

Yes oh!

-Because I have nothing to prove, walahi.

I love my job. I love my apartment. I love my chill time. I love my Netflix shows. I love my Baileys. I love my Ghana okro soup 😁

I love my life ❤

I look good 💝

I'm greatly loved. Terrifyingly adored 🙏

I have nothing to prove 🤷🏽‍♀️
.

In this life, I have already won.
