#GhanaChronicles 05

During lunch today...

I'm watching a woman, her toddler and the maid. 

The woman orders two plates of fried rice and chicken.

Food arrives.

The woman hands her baby to the maid. Baby is restless so maid stands to cuddle babe with its head placed gently over her shoulder.

Woman takes her time to eat. 

Then she beckons on the maid to give her the baby.

Maid hands baby over to woman, then maid sits to eat her own meal. She too takes her time to enjoy her meal.
.

This isn't an exceptional act by any measure, but the world is so cruel, any small act of kindness gets to me.

I don't know what happens in their home, but I am glad the maid could have a good meal without getting badgered to hurry up and hold the baby, OR her meal wrapped like a corpse to be dispatched home, OR denied food totally. 

I'm glad it didn't play out any other way.

I wasn't the nicest madam to the maids who worked for me when I was a nursing mother.

I was very dismissive. I was impatient. And I was distracted by the averageness of marriage. 

But I never denied their stomachs a good meal.

And I never owed them salaries. 

I wasn't easily swayed to feel empathy for them and their countless pity-parties, but I didn't deny them their rights. 

And they threw such elaborate pity-parties that they expected me to sponsor. 

"My mother's brother's girlfriend is sick. I want to collect six month's salary upfront. Abeg aunty!"

"Please fuck off."

Many of them killed their mothers every month... because they traded in Pity.

Too many lies.

I had to remind one that her father died eleven months ago. She was killing the niggaa every other month because she needed to run to the village to fvck a lowlife boyfriend.

Then she came back pregnant 🤷🏽‍♀️

I used to look at them like crawling insects. 

Of course, this isn't right. 

I survived that era.

Now, when I see a new mother or one with a toddler...

I shudder.
