Women don't understand how powerful they are.

It frustrates me to no end. 
.

Woman... YOU are the gender who births life.

Without YOU, there is no (hu)mankind.

You are GOD on earth. 

Don't you get it?

You are LIFE.

You are the reason the trees grow. You are the reason flowers bloom. You are oxygen. You are the reason everything has breath. 

Misogyny, submission and other weapons of Patriarchy are meant to break you and shame you. 

These weapons cannot pierce you. Can't you see?

You are the giver of life. 

You are GOD. 

Bitch, get up from the ashes and walk in the glory of your being. 

Everything you fight for... all the things that make you desperate... everything that makes you lose your power... all are beneath you.

Stop living like a beggar. 

Stop losing yourself to activities like marriage and childbearing. These are the extras, not the purpose. 

Stop losing yourself. Period.

If any gender is inferior, it can never be the gender that gives life. 

Never!

Woman, you are GOD.

Ascend your throne.

Rule.
