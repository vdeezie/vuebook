I strongly believe much of the content in your religious books are mere stories to entertain, not lessons to live by, not instructions to follow.

It’s like watching a movie. You have the information. You have been entertained. It is not meant to be re-enacted in your life in 2019.

These things happened thousands of years ago. Things have changed since then.

There are cars now, there’s technology, Science is doing wonders – things that never existed at that time.

How can you continue to troll a new world based on principles made by people who didn’t even have microwave or a refrigerator?

When they say the Word of God is unchanging, it is Rhema that doesn’t change – the specific connotation of his word in your life.

Every other thing is story - like the stuff you read to your child when he is about to go to bed. Your kid doesn’t wake up the next day wondering why his dog isn’t talking like the piglet in the movie ‘Babe’.

Even children understand these things.

To continue to push the narrative that the people or customs of old had superior knowledge - people who never had the privilege to see aluminium fly in the sky with hundreds of people sitting inside of it…

To continue to build habits and strategies around a people who would give anything to come back to earth and, at least, participate in something as mundane as riding in one of those rollercoaster in Disney… or at most, experience Artificial Intelligence...

To continue to build new habits around the obsolete is quite the tragedy.

You are living in the Possible world. The people who run this world – white people – can achieve just about anything.

Impossible is dead in the new world. Yet you have your focus on what Peter said to the Gentiles.

They are talking about flying cars and robotics in the new world. Do you think Peter wouldn't be impressed?

Yet YOU are buried in Deuteronomy that tells you not to “wear a material mixed of wool and linen together.”

Da fvck is wrong with you?

I mean... I can't tell you how to live your life. But religion takes too much space for nothing, contributing very little to world development.#Rant1929
