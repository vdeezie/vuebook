When I broke up with 'The Boyfriend'...

I returned his key, 'cos I want him to invite whoever he wanted to his fine place without worries.

But he didn't reciprocate oo. 

"I'm not giving you your keys, sorry," he said.

I didn't fuss.

I mean... there's no way I'm going to have segz in a studio apartment anyway! 🤷🏽‍♀️

Besides, he literally put that entire place together.

Let him keep the key.

My next segz will be in Europe. Insha Allah.

Segz in Nigeria is pathetic, anyways.

Third-world segz and shiii. Ewww.

🙄🙄🙄

PS: Dinner with 'The Boyfriend'. He took ten bad pictures. So I grabbed the phone and took one good selfie 😜
