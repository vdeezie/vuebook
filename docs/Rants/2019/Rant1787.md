Consumer Behaviour #CB12:
.

I'm in Lagos for 24 hours. 

Dropped the kids.

Yup. Holiday is over.

So that time Air Peace had that near-crash incident, in July, I decided to change to AWA airline.

AWA planes are small and they fill up on time.

I flew AWA for the first time last month. I liked it.

The in-flight snack is way better than the cold cupcake Air Peace pushes into your mouth that I never eat.

AWA gives chicken and cheese sandwiches with fruit juices, tea, and biscuits.

Even though it's just a 45 minutes flight from Accra to Lagos.

This morning, while heading to AWA section...

I saw one million Nigerians on a queue. 
RMD was there too.

It was a market queue. Even my daughters were like... "Where are they all heading to?"

So I asked one of the travelers.

"It's Air Peace flight to Lagos."

Aha!

Toh! Market people.

I sashayed far far away to AWA jejely üòÇ

"Look at that crowd!" Ife said to her sister as we walked away to peaceville.

The Boyfriend booked Lilygate hotel for me online. 

He's not in town, as usual. 

This is my first time at Lilygate. 

They gave me a glass of wine and a hot towel at the reception. 

I've only had that kind of reception in Dubai.

I love this hotel.

I always have my nose up when a hotel happens in Lekki. But Lilygate has some really nice finishing. Very similar to Four Points hotel.
.

It has been a day of warm welcoming...

At the supermarket where I bought the children's groceries for school, the manager gave me a bottle of wine.

He was excited when he saw our trolley.

I thought it was some kind of special promo... but he asked for my birthday, I told him June.

He shrugged and gave me a bottle of wine anyway.

"Thank you so much for shopping with us," he was very grateful. 

And it made me wonder... did I buy too many things? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

.

I brought my laptop along. 

I have scripts to write. 

How much I love everything about my room.

I'm going to see how it'll inspire creativity.

Then I'll soak myself in the bath later and listen to some music.
.

PS: 
I traveled with just a handbag and a laptop.
Traveling light is underrated.
