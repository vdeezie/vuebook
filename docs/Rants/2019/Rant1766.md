Waiting for a meeting to commence, my legs crossed, the sole of my heels easy for the next person to see.

"When did you get this shoe?" My boss asked.

"Months ago.'

"The sticker is still on it. Forty-seven thousand naira," he said and pointed to my sole.

I always forget to take out the price tag especially when it's at the bottom of the heels 

He clicked his phone to calculate the sum in cedis.

"700 cedis," he smiled, "That tells me the quality of man to introduce to you. You can't wear 700 cedis pair for nothing. We see you."

"700 cedis and above, please. We go higher."

'You are so full of self. It's exciting to watch," he said...

Then he added, "Naija babe!"
