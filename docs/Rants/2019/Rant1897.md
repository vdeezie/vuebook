Nigerians do the most.

You hold a free event. At a pseudo luxury venue. You send out customised invitation cards. With chocolate. And wine. And roses.

You promise them a three course meal – FREE. A favourite artiste is billed to perform. No gate fee – nothing.

All they need to do is show up. Show up at no cost. They even get to win fabulous prizes – for nothing.

They are coming to eat, drink and dance – for free. And you dash them stuff on top - as per father Christmas. 

Then after the event, you get emotional and start thanking them for showing up for you. You start crying and feeling wet.

I don’t understand. Why are you emotional?

You think Nigerians won't turn up for freebies and extra thrills?

Food. Wine. Music – all free? And an opportunity to network?

So why are you so emotional about that?

They don’t give a shit about you.

They’re on to the next and won’t even remember your name or event.

Do it because you have a business to promote or you are a clout chaser, I don't care...

But don’t act like you are surprised.

Why are you acting surprised?
.

I’ve seen this before – earlier in the year.

I’m seeing it again.

You people keep doing this nonsense - acting like you are loved because people show up to eat your free buffet.

Calm down.

It’s party jollof. And it brings all the boys and girls to the yard.
