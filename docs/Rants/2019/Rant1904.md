I turned down a very good offer today in Accra because I make more money on my own without leaving my apartment. 

But I wanted it. So I tried a bit of contouring - to see if I could remould myself and my schedule to fit in.

We talked for an hour to see if it would be possible. If I could be malleable.

It wouldn't. I couldn't. So I turned it down.

Sadly.

I wanted it. But I want what I already have also.

I want it all.

But I'm just one person.

My timetable for first quarter of next year is tight.
.

I love being an intrapreneur, especially if it is a brilliant company. 

And I miss that a lot.

Intrapreneurship is my kryptonite. 

Just tell me I have a beautiful office, and a team of my own, and the power to create and execute ideas... and I'll abandon everything and start dancing. 

But this entrepreneurship thingy with my art seems to be winning. 

It gives me money, gives me peace, and I have my entire 24 hours everyday as a gift to do what I want with it, without half the stress of intrapreneurship.

Artpreneurship is a blessing, no doubt. 

I want too many things within creative spaces.

And it's flattering to get these opportunities...

And heartbreaking that I can't take them.

Funny story happened two weeks ago...

I got an offer from a company. The salary was N500k. That's what the boss told me.

(I "met" him during that Tacha article season, when it hit Instablog. The man who said he'd bring me down to Lagos for a meeting the next day).

I said I couldn't take the offer. I recommended someone...

The person got back to me and said they offered her N120k.

I called the HR to ask what happened, because the boss offered me way more than that.

The lady I recommended said she wasn't even allowed to see the boss.

"The basic salary is N120k. To have you specifically on our team is worth the rest of the offer. If we are not getting you, then whoever we hire gets only basic salary," HR said to me on the phone.

I almost laughed because she was so formal. I couldn't believe she couldn't see how hilarious that sounded ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
.
.

I miss intrapreneurship. I miss the uncertainty of ideas and projects. 

But I don't think there's any room for that life again.

Ah well.

We move.
