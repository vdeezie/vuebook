I haven't seen the sun since last Friday.

Now my food supply is finished. 

I have to pause this love scene I am about to create in this script, and go to the supermarket.

I'm going to stuff this house with everything I need, so I don't have to step out for another week.

I'm also trying to grow my natural hair. I want it lower and give it really tight curls, so The Boyfriend can hold my head when the thrust needs to go deeper without the obstruction of pulling a weave. 

And I look cute as hell with tiny curls.

He's going to give me all his money when he sees me.

And when he needs to pull some hair, he can just wrap his arm around my breasts. Or put a hand around my neck then kiss the nape. We have to be creative with this love business. 

He's going to love how good Accra looks on me.

This 24/hour electricity and all-round Accra peace of mind, and preservation of human dignity, was created for people like me - half-misanthrope, half-crazy.

Bottom line: I'm horny and I need a vacation.

But first, I need chicken and jollof in my fridge. And mango juice.
.

When I get back from the supermarket, I'm going to decide if Idem is going to have segz with Tayo on his office table or be patient enough to wait after work and drive to the hotel where a room is paid in her name.

It's 5-star after all.

How does she want this d*ck served? ðŸ¤”

Decisions. Decisions. 

Ah! The tough job of a screenwriter ðŸ’…ðŸ’…

Have a good day, y'all ðŸ˜˜
