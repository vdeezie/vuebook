When you resign from a job and they call you back, it is important you own the power...

Especially if you earn above N600k monthly. 

Because if you leave a N600k-and-above monthly pay cheque, it means you weren't there for the money in the first place.

It means you were there for the things that make you a full being, ever-evolving, and fvcking creative. 

So they need to put that respeck on your name.

Walk in your power. 

Slay dragons.

And oh! Don't take back the job if you don't really really really want it. 

You have to really really really want it (three "reallys" to be exact).

Consider all the perks. 
.
.

People don't know how powerful you are.

If only they knew. 

I'm steadily walking in my power.

Walk in yours.

Hei God!!! This sounds like aspire-to-conspire-into-a-quagmire.

Can we motivate our tribe in peace without feeling somehow? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
