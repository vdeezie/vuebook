If you are a salesperson, you can pour R.Kelly's narcissism into bottles and sell as liqueur.

It will be so potent to the destruction of self and so addictive, you'd be rich in no time. 

Why?

1. People like themselves too much.
2. People cannot control their addictions. 

Two powerful reasons people buy stuff.
.

Remember to advise your buyers to take only a few sips a day, else they'd be so drunk in self-conceit they won't be able to dustinguish bird poop from an artwork. 

If they take too much of R.Kelly's liqueur...

Then they might actually believe they can fly...

Which would be a big Lie.
