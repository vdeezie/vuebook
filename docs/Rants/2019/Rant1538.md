I have always envied the woman who can be with a different man at different stages of her life.

I have always envied the woman who evolves into different relationships as she grows newer in knowledge every season... 

Experiencing different love stories...

Becoming a new woman when day breaks... A different woman. 

It's the only type of living-in-the-century that makes sense to me.
.

Congratulations to J.Lo on her engagement.

Another one might happen in ten years time when she is 59, and it will be OK.

I'll be here jealous-ing her free spirit. And endorsing her right to soak in all that life throws her way.

Love it!
