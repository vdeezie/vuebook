Ah!

Bath & Body Works...

Where we buy all the stuff we bring back home to give to family, friends and colleagues 😁

All the little small buys that fit into the sides of your bag.

And it is always the last place you visit - just a day before your return flight.

I remember raiding one of the stores in Houston with Vivian. She got incredible discounts online, so we were buying fragrance mists for $3 instead of $8... or something like that. We kuku buy full bag!

It was so cool.

One time, I came back with packs of mists and lotions and shower gels from Bath & Body Works...

After giving them out as gifts, only one item was remaining - it was a body mist called 'Mad About You'.

I wasn't mad about anyone at the time, so it stayed with me for so long until I remembered to take it along with me to my mum's place (after she had finished all the products I gave her initially from the trip).

She looked at the bottle and frowned...

"The bottle don old."

"It's been with me for long," I replied.

"You nor see man give, abi?" She chuckled. "Las' las' na me born you. As your mother, you must be mad about me. Yes. Na me be the real owner. Agaracha must come back."

She pressed the mist on her wrist, placed it in her drawer and continued minding her business.
