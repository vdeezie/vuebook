Okey Bakassi has a popular rape joke.

He has had it for years.

He shares it in almost every comedy show - from Eko hotel to University campuses.

YET Nigerians still pay to listen to this dude share this joke in a line-up of other misogynists and apologists parading as comedians. 

He has a show that is designed to be the Nigerian version of Trevor Noah's Daily Show (like he could ever!!! Like he could ever have the emotional intelligence of Trevor!).

This show is on your local version of CNN - Channels TV.

Okey has endorsements. He has projects...

And nothing, absolutely nothing - no repercussion for a joke that has become the trademark of his craft...

Shaming the victim.
.

This is how I survive Nigeria, nay Africa...

I remove myself from everything.

I don't endorse anyone. I don't stan anyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't need anyone.

It's a terrible thing to be one of them. 

It's a terrible thing to try and get their applause or recognition. 

Because these people - from celebrities, cross dressers, slayers, influencers to mechanics and millionaires - are one step away from saying something that will make you kill a donkey.
.

You are paying to hear someone tell you that when you wear a man's shirt in his house... he has a right to rape you, and not even The Police can do anything about it.

Carry on.
