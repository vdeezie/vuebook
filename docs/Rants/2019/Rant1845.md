People don't understand that a job is an opportunity for an intrapreneur to add value.

If the only thing a job gives me is money, then I don't need it.

I can make money on my own. And I have many times.

A job, for me, is a platform to use a structure to do things on a bigger scale.

If a job cannot provide that structure, then it's a waste of my time. 

Employers are always hurt when you leave...

But they fail to understand that it is MY life that was wasted. 

If I work in a company for, say, five months and the only benefit was money...

That is five months of my life wasted for something I could easily get on my own.

There's nowhere I have worked where I couldn't make my salary by myself, sitting in my house, writing. 

I am crazy about smart/creative people and proper structures...

And for reasons beyond me, I have never had to work with people who are as creative as I am or with decent structures.

I get paid well, yes. But I am always never satisfied. 

I would take a lesser pay to work with a company that understands the strength of my skill and have the smart sense to put a structure together. 

That is how BORED I am with fat salaries and poor structures.

I am bored!#Rant1845
