THANK YOU!!!
.

I want to thank you all...

Thank you to the 35 people who have paid for my book upfront, Las' Las' We'll Be All Right. I announced only a few hours ago. Amazing!
.

Thank you to all 26 students presently studying different courses at TAAC.
.

Thanks to the 218 deliveries of Nzuri we have made in only a few weeks. My Nzuri customers  are the very best. Beauty is yours!
.

Thanks to the 51 emails we got for advertising rates for ISLAND WEEKLY,  and here's a big thank you to the 10 advertisers who have paid until the third edition of the coming publication. Whew!
.

Thanks to the 9 subscribers of The Breakfast Company 
(PS: I'm struggling with this particular business, I won't lie. The overhead on paper is nothing close to the reality. I told myself if I don't get 25 breakfast subscribers upfront, I ain't moving forward with it. I have 9 subscribers. I am not going to launch on 9 clients. It's too expensive to do that. And I am not in the mood to lose money one bit. So I might have to shelf this particular business for a minute and pay attention to the others. We'll see).
.

I also want to thank clients of Write Culture, Emem Isong and Omoni Oboli, who have paid and ensure we are going to be busy all year round. TV series are the best. It's a never-ending stream of income.
.

I can hold an entire session on building serial small businesses and how to spread your capital wisely around every project for smart returns. 

This is all accidental. I literally slipped into this entrepreneurial life... *oops!*

It is not as cool as it looks from the outside. It's sleepless nights and restlessness and mental drudgery.

It requires sacrificing everything - love, affection, a social life... but I am not complaining. 

I am here. I am on this journey.

And I want to thank you for coming on this journey with me. Thank you for your kind words that you pour on me generously.

We are heading somewhere.

But what makes this trip so much fun is... I have no clue where we are going!

It's an adventure!

We have just one life...

Fuck it, let's LIVE! 

Just remember that no matter how crazy it gets... Las' las' we'll be all right!

😘😍😁😊🤗❤💕
