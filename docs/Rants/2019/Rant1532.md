People: Joy, how do you manage to look so young and gorgeous at 41?

Me: I am in love with a man ten years younger than me. So there's radioactivity going on. You know, there's spontaneous emission of energetic waves of lust and love. It's fast-paced so some particles of our love smash into walls and bounce back at us, leaving cuts and bruises and pain and dying and broken hearts. 
This energetic emission is sufficient to break me, but I'm badass, so I turn it to Beauty instead.

People: Wow! Err...

Me: Oh! And I use Nzuri activated charcoal products. It deals with aging and leaves my skin fresh.

People: Oh ok.

Me: I think it's more Nzuri than my radioactive love. What do you think?

People: Err... sure. Wow.

Me: 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🙄😁😆😛🤧

*PS: Henceforth, this is my response to this question that has refused to age.

Las' Las' We'll Be All Right 🤷🏽‍♀️💅#Rant1532
