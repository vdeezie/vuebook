So I called him... and I started this nonsense rambling about wanting a kiss. And being horny.

He was quiet for a minute. 

"Joy, you don't want a kiss or sex. You are feeling a certain way for just a few minutes. Maybe you are taking a break from work. Before I drive down to pick you up for a night rendevzous... heck, before I get into my car and start the engine sef, you will call me and tell me not to bother again. You do that all the time," he said.

Ah! Is this really who I am? 🤔😳

"You are searching for some kind of love. Something that accommodates all of your hardwork, art, madness and zero-fuckery. You will not find them all in one man," he continued.

😢😢😢

"I am not saying you should settle. Maybe what you are looking for is out there. Who knows? But what are the chances of bumping into him in a space occupied by 7 billion peeps?"

😭😭😭

Then he added...

"See ehn, love is not perfect. It's compromise. What you want versus what is closest to what you want. If I am closest to what you want, when I end this call... call me again."

I didn't call him again.

I went to the fridge and brought out my ice cream.

Na horny I horny, I nor kee person 🤷🏽‍♀️

PS: Ladies, if you are not having sex, ice cream gives orgasm without lecture.

I know this!

You're welcome.

Toh.
