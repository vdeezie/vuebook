One of the sweetest things in life...

When The Boyfriend visits the girls in school with bags of groceries and pocket money just two weeks after midterm - two weeks after shopping and dropping them in school.

Aww! Bless!! ❤

"Thank you, baby," I say.

"Come back to Lagos. I miss you," he says. 

"This is my life now. And I really love this life I have created."

"I know."

"Besides, you are always busy and travelling," I say.

"Yea. Yea."

"How is your sex life?" I ask.

"Fvck you."

"Hahahhaha. Do you want to hear my own?"

He laughs out loud.
"I want to see that man you will permit to touch your body. You won't even let me pay for a spa because your body is made of Musgravite! Are you even human?!"

😮😮😮😮😳😳😳

"F.U.C.K Y.O.U" I emphasised every letter of the words  

He laughed the loud laughter of victory. 

I ended the call.

Shior! 🙄
