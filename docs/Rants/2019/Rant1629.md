In case you were eating jollof when I wrote about Kotoka International airport and missed it...

Let me reiterate...

Kotoka International airport in Accra is as beautiful as airports in Paris and Dubai (see pics). 
.
.

But then I landed Lagos a minute ago...

The Pick-up point at the airport is a shed - like a storage room for working tools and animals.

No kidding.

Then the rains poured. 

Everybody - white, black and orange, were wet to their pants.

I was drenched. 

The Boyfriend was there to pick me up.

He wanted to do superman and jump out from his car in solidarity of my wetness.

*coughs*

I told him to stay in the car jeje, while Roberta and I do James Bond and jump inside his SUV.

It was hilarious... and sad... and very Nigerian.
.
.

Anyway, I am here for only a few days to see my children, my mother, my brother...

And to pinch Prisca's cheeks.

Then I'm out of here, binshes.

My office in Ghana misses me already.
.
.

I was going to juxtapose Kotoka airport with Muritala airport...

But there's no point to it.

We already know where we are on the value chain.

As irresponsible as I see the Nigerian optimism, I figure it is the only way to survive.

Las' Las'...
