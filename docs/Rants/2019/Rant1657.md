Convener of The Conversation.

When we carried Feminism on our heads. 

Tsk. Tsk.
.

These days, my take is simple:

If you want to be liberated...

No culture, no construct, no opinion, no religion, no social norms, NOBODY can stop you.

If you want to live in the fullness of your being, not even Patriarchy can stop you. 
.

If you want something, ask for it.

If they don't give it to you, demand for it.

If they still don't give it to you, break out and go create your own reality. 

It is that simple.
.

My kids can't remember if I am a feminist or not (I stopped using that term at home)...

BUT they know for a FACT that their mother lives the life she wants without breaking, bending or conforming to Patriarchy.

My life is the message.
.
.

We seem to forget that there are just as many female misogynists as there are men.

I have fought more bitch-ass women than I have fought men.

I fight everyone - male or female - who tries to break or shame. 

Keep your labels. 

I am not on the side of men or women.

I am on the side of liberty. 
.

My life is my receipt.
