Yesterday, after work, I booked an uber and took a long drive around town to nowhere. 

It was a beautiful evening, and I wasn't ready to retire for the night.

An hour later, I stopped at Kotoka airport to use the ATM.

All the ATMs were rejecting my card.

You see, the  confidence I have in Zenith bank is of the highest quality mulberry silk fabric. 
(I don't even know what I was trying to say with that 😂)

Truth is, I have been in places in the world where my Zenith card proved a more reliable card than The Boyfriend's other bank cards.

I remember the first time we came to Ghana - that was last year...

He was asking me out then, and as a Nigerian girl, all I wanted to do was shop. 

I entered a luxury store, bought a whole lot of stuff... but his GTB card (or was it Access premium card) didn't work. 

Niggaa wanted to die! 🤣🤣🤣

I told him I could pay. But he wasn't having it. How can all his fancy cards fail him now 😂

I'd known him for only a month then, these days there's no anxiety, I just flip my card out and he'd do the necessary transfer later, in minutes. 

He was calling his account managers, they were apologising for the "embarrassment"... It was hilarious 🤣

After trying his cards and nothing worked, I flipped out my good ol' Zenith card and paid for everything.

Of course I got an alert a few hours later.

I don't even need to inform my account officer that I'm leaving town...

From Houston to Manhattan, Boston to Brooklyn, Dubai to London, Ghana and Gambia... my Zenith card works.

It has never failed me.

So it was a shock to me, yesterday, that I couldn't withdraw money. 

And I had nothing on me - just a few 10 cedis.

This particular airport ATM has been my most reliable machine until yesterday. 

Ugh!

I was slightly frustrated because I had to pay the uber, and I had to go to the mall to get things I wanted. 

I called my boss to rescue me.

"The ATMs aren't working. I'm stranded."

He was still in the office, so he told me to drive back to the office...

He paid the Uber driver. Then we drove together  to an ATM and he withdrew a chunk of money and said I shouldn't stress it until the end of the month.

"You've spent so much moving to Ghana. I'm shocked you are not broke yet," he smiled.

"I run small businesses in Nigeria," I replied. 

"Of course you do, brilliant woman."

No, I didn't blush. There's no kind of compliment I have not received in this world. 
.

When I went for the second phase of my medicals last week, the male doctor looked at my medical/personal details and then looked at me.

"You can't be 41."

"I am," I said.

"I am a doctor. I know age."

"But I am," I chuckled.

"You are stunning."

Then silence followed. And a sigh. 

Then he did something impressive. 

"I've paid you a compliment about the way you look, and I'm about to tell you to lie down and get examined. So I'm going to have to call a female colleague to do it."

Wow.

Yea. That was my reaction. Wow. 

This is not Europe. This is Ghana.

If it had anything to do with the formal presentation of documents from my office requesting that I should be attended to, and not just a random patient, I don't know.

Lord knows I wanted to get his number after that 😂😂

It was extraordinary social performance. 
.

But I deviate... 😀

I was talking about my boss rescuing me... and taking me to the mall to get what I want... and him apologising for the little corporate misunderstanding we suffered during a strategy meeting...

And me being grateful that as an artist in a third-world country I can afford to live this kind of life...

'Cos it's a damn beautiful one from where I am.

Bless ❤

PS: Anyway, Zenith sent this. So all is well with the world again 😊
