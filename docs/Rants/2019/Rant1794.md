Eeyah! 

And that Blossom's wife flaunted that marriage oo!
.

That is why I flaunt only gifts, food, vacation and hotel rooms.

No time for long story. 
.

That was how I met one mgbeke sometime back, and she asked...

"Why not post a picture of The Boyfriend?"

I looked at her like a disease.

"Why not change your wig?"

She walked away... with her wig like witchcraft.

I think she subbed me the next day on her wall. She managed to gather 3 likes and one comment. 

The commenter said: "Well, learn to mind your business."

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

I was proud. Nigerians are getting smarter.
.
.

I do not owe anybody any picture of love. 

I will share what I want to share. And I choose to share fine dining and gifts.

Even his shadow on the floor whilst he takes my picture shall be blurred. 

I am in control of my own narrative. 
.

.

Like this picture...

The Boyfriend bought me this Ted Baker limited edition dress in Dubai. 

The cloth cost well well. I like it. I don rock am taya!

He bought the Aldo heels too in Dubai.

The yellow bag, he paid for it in Lagos. 

The hotel is Jumeirah beach hotel. He paid for two weeks we stayed.

Even the weave on my head, he paid for it - N78k, I think. 

I'm about to turn the weave to a wig sef.
.

I will not show you anything else. 

His wrist sef you will not see.
.

Moral of the story: None. 
.

PS: I think I want a vacation ðŸ˜­

PSS: The watch is Michael Kors. He bought it too, in Dubai ðŸ˜˜
