In-between YouTube videos I enjoy, are commercials.

One particular commercial starts off with...

"Only a mother knows the magic of..."

I cut it off after the mandatory 5 seconds. 

I hate femvertising. 

Only a mother knows the...
Only a wife understands the...
Only a girl knows how to...

Keep that burden far away from me, please.

So fvcking patronising! But we all do it 🤷🏽‍♀️

They usually would employ the patient motherly voice of an elderly woman to deliver the message. 

So you are reminded of your mother and all the times she said a girl is supposed to be this-or-that.

Shackles.

In other news...

My beautiful daughters came first in their respective classes.

Jolly's pretty face is still on the wall of fame as the best student.

That's my own quota to femvertising.
