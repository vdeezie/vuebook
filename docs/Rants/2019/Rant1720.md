I ask for hot chocolate when I have breakfast buffet at hotels.

Always.

Many do not have. Some do.

They always have coffee and tea though.

I hate tea. 

And the only time I took coffee, I was high. No joke! üòÇ

So hot chocolate drink for me.
.

Y'all remember the story of how I fell in love with hot chocolate drink, right?

2016. Manhattan. Dunkin' Donuts.

Right!!!

I go jogging in the morning, and when I'm walking back to the hotel, I always stop at the nearest Dunkin' Donuts to get my super hot drink. 

That was the start of a love affair.

Radisson Blu in Lagos gives hot chocolate too.

Intercontinental hotel doesn't. 

Oriental hotel, nah!

Federal Palace, nope!

Nah, Nope, No for all the other pretentious 4-star hotels.
.

Labadi beach hotel in Accra serves it with the tiniest mug. It's depressing. 

La Palm resort has a better mug, but it was never hot enough.
.
.

But this hotel beats 'em all.

I asked for it this morning, the lady's first response was negative. 

Five minutes later, she comes with a kettle of it!

I thought she was going to pour some in my cup and take the rest away for other guests... but she said it was all mine. 

And so, my people, I drank every drop from that refill kettle!
.
.
.

Verdict: I have visited the toilet 5 times today. 

And my tummy still rumbles from saccharine gratification.
.

Still a small price to pay for the deliciousness of the best morning drink ever - hot chocolate drink! üòÅ‚ù§
