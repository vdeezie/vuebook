I travelled to a new country 5 days ago.

3 days later, I got a job.

Top creative management level.

They don't know me. Never heard of me.

But I told them I had something to say.

I spoke for one full hour. 

The CEO nodded. I had his full attention. He was blown away.

The Assistant HR was all smiles. 
.

When she led me out of the room, she said to me, "You are a brave woman."

I got the job 3 days later.

They created a position for me.
.
.

Today I rented a brand new home. Newly built. It's so beautiful, I can't believe it!
.

Arrived 5 days ago. 

Got a job 3 days later. 

Got an exquisite apartment 4 days later.

In a country where no one in its corporate institution knows my name.

Look in your mirror and say...

"Bitch, I am not afraid."

Say it with your chest every day.

And even if you say it and you are still afraid...

Go ahead and do it afraid.

Just do it.
.
.

Go out there and be all you can be.

You have just one life.

It is not as long as you think it is.

Live.
