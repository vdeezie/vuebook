Never heard of Invictus Obi until yesterday. 

This morning, The Boyfriend wakes me up with a long phone call on how the actions of this Invictus will escalate Nigeria's risk perception and index... and the tight scrutiny Nigerians will be subjected to... and how it will all affect legit Nigerian businesses. 

I don't know this niggaa called Obi. This ignorance is deliberate when it comes to Nigerians and their simplistic idea of money worship.

I am just a simple writer. 

I make N500k every two weeks writing scripts as a side business. And a "few dollars" on a day job.

What do I know about wealth?

One rich niggaa has mocked my humble art many times sef.

I don't know. I don't know. 

My biggest worry at the moment is how to plan the death of Reuben amongst his roommate, his girlfriend and the Uber driver he booked...

It's a tough situation because I want to make them all look guilty, so his death has to happen around a time frame when he affiliates with them differently, within a 10 minutes gap.

Yes, that's a script I am writing. 

Between me and my chocomilo, that's all I care about.

Nigeria will heal itself when it recognizes the tragic link between "hustle oo", third-world hailing, and the astonishing culture of greed.

Until then... local girl is unbothered.
