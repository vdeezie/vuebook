A product of Yoruba love.

*coughs*

We date. We love. We lust. We laugh. We dream. We chat. We plan 🤓

We argue. We fight. We burn. We part ways.

You look at me. I look at you 😉

We want more. We hurry back. We fvck harder 👊

We destroy our reputation under the sheets 🤣

We break up. We break down 😭

We come back 😁

We love a little more desperately 👏

We break up the umpteenth time with a little more finality 🙏

We exhale 🙌

We move on 🚶‍♀️

We close chapters 😐

We return to the known. It's safer there 🤷🏽‍♀️

We live. We thrive away from burning passions that almost cosume us 😊

To have spent an entire lifetime loved by only ONE tribe, by choice...

And still love the way you look in the mirror.

It means one thing...

They loved you right 😁

Yes ke!

Bhet... as ayam moving to another kontri...

Let me officially say goodbye to Yoruba love.

You have been good to me oo!

My "official niccur for life" (The Boyfriend) is Yoruba. And he will always be in my life.

But as a grown woman... I am looking at my life with a smile. It's gonna be fun, scary and beautiful.

PS: I won't be surprised if I find Yoruba men waiting for me in Ghana to continue from where they stopped 🤣

I love you, but move away plix! 🤣😂😃😍😘
