Dear Scriptwriters (Part 2)
.
.

Shhh...

Let me tell you a little secret. 

I created this character that I loved dearly...

But the actress assigned to the role was bad - very bad.

I had so much tasks for this character for the coming seasons... 

But after watching the actress inteprete that role poorly, I had to go back to ensure she dies in the next season. Just die already!

Whew!

I changed the entire story because I never want to see her again. 

She's not an actor. Nobody can tell me otherwise. Cringeworthy acting. My heart broke everytime I watched her.

A brilliant role given to a poor performer.

Why?!
.
.

Ironically, one character that was supposed to fade away was acted by one of the best actors I've watched on small screen.

So I'm bringing her back and giving her character more scenes and tasks.
.

Let bad actors die, no matter how much you've invested in the character. They ruin everything. 

Then save the good actors. Tweak your script and give them more to fulfil. 

Do your art this favour. 

And save us all from bad series and movies.
.

Remember, you are the god of the script.

Exercise your omnipotence.
