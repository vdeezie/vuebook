I really want to appreciate my children's school for understanding that...

There's Joy Isi Bewaji living her life as a woman aware of her liberties, fulfilling her unconventional dreams, highly opinionated and controversial. 

And there's Joy Isi Bewaji as a mother, who never owes school fees, has very intelligent kids, instructs them properly, and provides everything the school demands to make their academic journey a good one.
.

Thank you for not relating with me or my children from a point of prejudice. 

That was what the former school did, so I ripped their skin off their body and fed it to dogs.

They didn't experrit.
.

Ah well! Can't wait for my kids to be done with secondary school...

There's a lot of living waiting to be lived outside those four-walls.
