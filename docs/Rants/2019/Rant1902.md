Frame 1:

Regular niggaa sights a rich niggaa...

"Bros mi! Chairman! Oga! I greet o! Anything for the boys? Any giveaway! Make I carry your man purse, bros! Wey your car? That one? Make I help you open the door. Ah! See stain for inside your eye! Make I blow am?! Wait! Make I buy pure water take wash your windshield. Well done, bros!"
.
.

Frame 2:

Niggaz talking about a rich niggaa:

"Mehn, that guy just dey burst my brain! You see the house wey him build? Chai! The guy travel go Italy sef! E be like say e don build house for village. E don buy houses all over Lagos! Omo, that guy make sense. E make sense die! Imagine if I dey im inner circle. Chai! Chineke! Oluwa oo! I don send message tire! Na wa! E go better sha! But that guy bahd! I dey stalk am for every social media! I swear! Na the levels be dat. Make e just cough for my inbox one day, I go pick race go meet am! Something must drop!"
.
.

Frame 3:

Lady sights rich nigga: "Hi."

Rich niggaa: "Hi. You want to spend sometime with me?"

Girl: "I'd like that. Yes."
.
.

Frame 4:

Average niggaz: You see that girl, she don follow man enter club because e get money! Ashawo! Bastard binsh!!! Dem go soon rape am, dump am like dustbin! Nonsense!
.

If niggaz could, they would.

But niggaz can't, so they hate.

This also applies to bitter women setting moral standards for cute as fvck women, like Toke, looking like slice bread.

You hate to see it, but you want that kind of glow!

I'm bored with the hate people have for "slay queens" who are admired by men you can't have.

There's a lady on Twitter, Onyii, all she needs to do is ask, and she gets what she wants. 

She is cute, stylish, young, living her best life.

I love to see it.

But someone called her "premium olosho" for looking so damn sexy and getting all the attention.

You are just mad 'cos you can't be a (type of) woman and do nothing but exist and get what you want.

I'm sure a lot of niggaz fantasize about that kind of life.

It is why they hate women who have it.

Niggaz love successful men. They want to occupy the same space with these men...

But they are heterosexuals and cannot sexualise their desires.

Women can.

Let them.

If men could be women, they would grab the opportunity to be slay queens just so they can smash some of these brodas they fvcking adore so much!

Women can.

Why are you so mad?

Stop hating on beautiful Instagram women who get a N500k purse just by wearing the right lipstick on a well edited picture.

That's life...

And it's unfair to you.
