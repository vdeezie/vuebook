I call Ghanaian niggaa to tell him I resigned from my job and I feel so happy about my decision.

He says I'm crazy.

I say I know. 

Then he says... "I almost had sex recently. Really cool girl."

And I was like... "Why didn't you have the sex?"

And he was like... 

"Because I'm still in love with someone else."
.
.

If this was a script, this is the moment to cue in a romantic soundtrack.

But this is real life, and there's no soundtrack.

So I said...

"Niggaa go and get laid, abeg."
.

Me that I am waiting for Mauritius so I can take-it-from-the-back while looking out the window from a 5-star hotel...

You think I am waiting for permission or soundtrack?

Ma'frend, go and get laid and come and tell me all about it. 

Shior.
