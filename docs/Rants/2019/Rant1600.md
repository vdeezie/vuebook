'Avengers: Endgame' is supposed to premiere tomorrow in local cinemas across Nigeria...

But I can't see it tomorrow because Nigerians have made it a red carpet affair.

God!

These people!

You did not write the script. 

Your actors did not feature in the movie.

Your directors are the worst in the world when it comes to interpreting emotions.

Marvel does not know you.

They don't care about you.

I doubt our patronage is represented in the gross profit the movie makes beyond a few pennies in the ocean.

We don't matter. 

Our industry doesn't matter.

When they think of us they think of fraud and under-development. 

They scoff at our insecure rich always yapping about other people's development... and they glamorise our poor.

We don't matter.

Your celebrities don't matter beyond this dark continent.

Not one gripping Nollywood movie has been created.

Please fold your red carpets and dump them in your house!

Save your celebration for the day Nollywood has a movie that can compete with Slumdog Millionaire, at least.

Until then, stop these silly red carpet charade in a third-world country without electricity, celebrating what you don't know.

Let us pay and see the movie and go home.

Abeg!

The thing is paining me jare!

I can't see the movie tomorrow because these local celebrities will be everywhere on many red carpets acting like they had breakfast with Thanos before slipping into their tuxedos and spanx.

Shior!
