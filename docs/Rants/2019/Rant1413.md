Nina is/was my neighbour in Lekki.

I think she’s left the apartment, I’m not sure but I haven’t seen her since Christmas. And the security did mention that a tenant moved out. I didn’t ask who it was. I’m guessing it’s her, but I was chilling at Oriental hotel, so maybe she too is chillaxing some place else, trying to get her vibe set for the new year. I don't know.

I never speak to her or make her aware that I know who she is.

We say hello in the morning when I’m leaving for work and she’s hanging on her corridor, and that’s about it.

Miracle used to come around too, many moons ago.

But these things are not my concern.

I don’t look at anyone long enough to acknowledge their presence.

Except Trevor Noah comes to town, of course, I will find him and throw my panties at him.

Apart from him, I am oblivious to "famous people".

Nina is a young girl. We criticised her on the show (BBN), and we talked about her pretentious posts at some point.

Under the guise of celebrity culture, people will have opinions, because if you are on a show like Big Brother, you are forfeiting your right to privacy.

So yes, the audience will take advantage of that.

But what I do not understand is how a mentor cannot cloak her (Nina’s) inadequacies without becoming as antagonistic as the virtual crowd that is always in search of blood.

Nigerians do not have a culture of Mentoring.

What we understand is Apprenticeship.

And this is why when someone invests in you, they can easily disrespect you.

You can’t cough. You can’t sneeze. You can’t miss their brother’s birthday. You can’t question. You can’t do anything, except make them and their loved ones feel good about themselves.

So when you forget to remember their child’s birthday, they are going to feel slighted.

That's apprenticeship.

Mentorship cannot work in a society that promotes submission so fiercely. Mentorship cannot work in a society that is ageist and orthodox.

And that is why I stick to Boss-Employee relationships.

Do your job. Get your salary. And let it end there.

If I criticise you, it will be for being incompetent at your job.

But this whole charade of mentorship where one has to constantly have her head bowed so she doesn’t offend her “benefactor” is tiring and very far from what mentoring should be.

Tiannah at some point must get tired of always calling Nina out for, err, not grovelling enough to her liking.

In civilised societies, respect should be enough. Respect is polite, not sycophantic.

Instead of mentoring, have a work relationship, so if you have to let the person go you can take back the official car, and everything you need to take back and save them your constant yapping of “ingratitude”.

Because to give someone a car and constantly remind her you have done all these wonderful things for her and she needs to bow and suck the thumb of your children is vile.

And if she is not what you think she is, give her one big bashing and move the fuck on. But to always call her out and make a fuss is just vile.

You are her mentor not a troll.

Your job is to protect her, else don’t take up the responsibility at all.

Pfff!

PS: I am having the most delicious goat meat stew at this restaurant. 

"The boyfriend" came around to say hi to the kids and managed to drag me out for dinner.

I mean... I'm single, after all 💅💅💅
