# Rant1734

Warning: there are many contrasting emotions in this rant, with sharp edges.

When it is a social gathering of more than two people, there's always the temptation to talk about Sex-Love-Relationship-Marriage. 

And so it happened yesterday.

Except it was happening with a different  nationality.

I was the only Nigerian. 

Getting to know people, which is not primarily my intention or interest, I found myself in the midst of four men and two ladies yesterday evening.

After career conversation, where I passionately shared my frustration about Art in third-world societies like Lagos and Accra...

The next gallop led us to familiar territories on Relationships. 

"I think people require and desire different types of partners in different phases of their lives, especially high-energy people and artists," I said.

"Why?" One lady asked. 

"Because high-energy people and artists are inclined to depression easily, but monotony in love will kill them faster," I added.

I swear, the table was quiet as if they recognised a tumour growing out of my skull. 

Not the first time I'm getting that kind of reaction 🤷🏽‍♀️

"But hey, we can all pretend it's all BS, and yap about that one person we want to spend the rest of our lives with. I promise, I can fit into that conversation too," I added and smiled. 

At this point I was trolling because I was bored, and we hadn't even ordered drinks.
.

I am beginning to think the rate at which my boredom hits the roof is a medical disorder.

One of the guys smiled and said, "I like women who talk like this."

Then I realised... shoot! He (and probably all of them) thought I was only referring to MEN as the only gender with "high-energy" and "artistic tendencies".

He thought the whole idea of "requiring and desiring different partners at different stages in life" only represented the needs of his gender. 

😂😂😂

Of course, I corrected that notion immediately.

Now, everyone was uncomfortable 🤣

"But women are monogamous," one of the ladies said.

"But... you can't speak for every woman," I said. 

"Wait, are women even allowed to be like that?" Someone else asked. 

Ugh!

With that said, I zoned out immediately.

I was there, but I was not there. My soul was flying in the clouds. My body present.

Everything from then on sounded like a swarm of bees invading a colony. 

Do bees invade colonies?

Would an invasion require a different species, like wasp?

My train of thought left the room.

I let my brain rest as I nodded to eveything they were saying. Uninterested.

Then I took an Uber and went home. 

My girls opened the door.

"Hiya mummy! How was your day?"

"Do you know I am a brilliant scriptwriter? Do you know how painful it is to live in societies like these? I am so jealous of  people behind Lion King and Marvel movies... heck Mad Men on Netflix! I am living waaaaay beneath my art."

That was how I started, right at the door.

I wasn't really talking to them, I was talking to myself. I could taste the depression on my tongue. 

But they were listening. 

"Don't worry, mummy. We are artists too. Whatever you cannot accomplish because you have to provide for us, we will accomplish at our time," Ife said.

"And you will be our manager," Jolly added.

We laughed.

"Be everything in the movie industry, don't be an actress," I said.

"Ahn! Ahn!! Manager, why are you harsh?" I can't remember if it was Ife or Jolly who said this, but we all laughed again. 

I kissed their foreheads and asked that they microwave dinner - jollof rice and goat meat.

Then I went to my room, sat on my bed and opened a file on my phone to read a piece I saved.

I found it a while ago. And I look at it everytime I feel...

I don't know who they are, but the words have kept me alive.
