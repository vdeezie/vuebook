My fine-dining palate is slightly weird.

I want to identify taste in my brain, not on my tongue.

Yes, I know everything happens in the brain, but...

I sha don't want taste on my tongue immediately, as I indulge in the epicurean lifestyle 😁😁

Taste on the tongue is too easy.

If a meal costs N38k, then I want every fork of it, into my mouth, to tell a different story.

I need my brain to decode flavours and spices.
.

So when The Boyfriend takes me out and I taste the meal...

If it hits my tongue too quickly, I tell him it's not so delicious. Tongue gets bored of taste too soon.

If I cook at home, then by all means let the taste slap my tongue from left to right. No wahala.

But for the price of meals he pays for... then gourmet meals have to be sensual.

Yes oo!

If na to belleful, buy roasted plantain and groundnut, then flush with big Coke.

But if it is fine-dining, let it be an experience. 

We have to be demisexual abourrit, mehn!
.

PS: I should open an album for all the fine meals I've had. This is just a few.

I can recall the taste of every meal we've enjoyed together.
