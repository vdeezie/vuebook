Taking the girls back to school after yet another election break.

I pick them up from their grandmother's place.

Ife says she needs to pick another school bag from my Festac apartment.

My Festac apartment. A distant memory.

We drive to my Festac apartment.

This used to be my haven.

I loved this place.

My cute 3-bedroom space. Away from all the noise and chaos of life.

Festac.

Sigh.

All of my stories were curated here.
.

I am staring at the apartment from the car when we get there. 

Nostalgia.

This peace in my heart is priceless. 

"You miss this place, don't you?" Ife asks, "You miss how simple your life used to be."

"Simple. How do you mean?" I ask.

"You used to be so laidback about everything, writing your scripts on your bed. Now you are so busy in Lekki," she said.

Then she added, "Your life changed so drastically in one year."

I am afraid to ask, "for good or bad"?

I am afraid to know what my kids think of my life then and now.

All I know is... I don't know what the f*ck I am doing.
.

Driving through Festac this minute... there's nothing I want more than a simple life.
