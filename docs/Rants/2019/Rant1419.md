See ehn...

I am always confused when I walk into a supermarket to buy back-to-school groceries for my kids, and the next thing I hear the cashier say is...

FORTY TASAND NAIRA!

Like...WTF!!!

It's just milk and ovaltine and cornflakes and detergent and deodorant!

Just groceries oh! 

Like... what da actual fack!

Ok yea, I got myself a pack of hipster panties...

Still doesn't justify how N1k + N2k + N3k = N40K!!!

Kellogg's alone is N4,300!

It always leaves me shocked. 

And it hasn't finished oh! We are stilll off to another supermarket to get the stuff we couldn't find here.

Whew!

I've been doing this for TEN years!

I haven't even added school fees yet, and clothes, and entertainment fee.

Fuck it! I am the mother of the year!

Single parents who live upscale lives are Kings!

You can't tell me nothing!

I'm not waiting for anyone to crown me.

I crown myself.

PS: The girls wanted skin tights. It was something they never bothered about as day students, but I think it is a thing for boarders. That alone "ate" my N10k...

Because I always tell them to take as many as they can ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

It is well.
.

PSS: I gotta give a shout out to "The boyfriend" who still insists on paying the children's fees even after I called it off.

Yoruba men of a certain kind are not just men... they are the salt of the earth.

My own earth.

Kids are back to school.

Now I am ready for 2019!
