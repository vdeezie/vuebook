I know this is tough for virtuous women of Nigeria to understand...

But I am not celibate because I am waiting for someone - a magical right one.

The thought of that is hilarious. 

I am not trying to be a "good woman" for anyone's benefit. 

It's disgusting to even think that. 

How do you read me for this long and believe that I would ever place any Nigerian man's ego or standards or judgment over my desires. 

If you know where I place 95% of men enjoying patriarchy, you will understand.

I am celibate because I am NOT attracted to a loooooooot of men.

I am hardly ever attacted to men.

And I am NEVER attracted to women. I know because they ask me out and I sincerely do not want to touch them sexually, chat romantically or be with them.

And none of this is an attempt to be a "good woman".

I've been celibate more times than I've had sex.

I really don't like the idea of random persons I barely fancy touching my breasts and inserting... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is my body we are talking about - Clarins and Nzuri glow. Exercise and fine dining.

And I'm supposed to surrender it to just anyone? Under this smelly patriarchy?

Nah mehn.

I will wait. And it's not exactly "waiting". I'm not waiting for anyone. I'm not sleeping beauty. I'm just chilling. 

And I am not a "good woman".

I'm a bad bitch, please.
