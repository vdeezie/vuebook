I dreamt of my father last night. 

It was a dream as long as a movie. 

Like dreams, it was in patches of scenes and intentions. 

It meant nothing. It meant everything. 
.
.

The moments of him that I miss are the moments he would declare himself the very breath of life - the essence of the earth, the reason for the sun.

As a young child my father's arrogance was such a joy to watch. He was full of himself - it was beautiful. 

His words weren't empty proclamations. He was indeed the most unconventional man of his time. 

He was the energy that lit up the dark spaces of the world around him. And even though his pride made everyone uncomfortable, he knew I liked it.

He knew.

I have never seen my father weak. It must have  been lonely to always appear tough. 
.
.

My father is immortal to me.

I am a better version of him - the balance of strength and weakness, of wealth and art...

Of zero fuckery and godship.

His energy guides me.

I am he. And he is I.
