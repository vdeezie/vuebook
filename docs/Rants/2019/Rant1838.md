October 8, 2019

I spent a chunk of my 20s and early 30s in a church that constantly positioned men, in their sermons, as the prize. 

We were told, constantly, to be a certain way to get a man to love us.

That shit messed up my entire life.

I am just getting out of it.

It distorts you, mentally.

And this is me - someone who could easily be described as above average in intelligence...

YET, it took me so long.

If it wasn't for that social/religious prepping... someone like me has no business, whatsoever, getting married.

I have no business in a Nigerian marriage AT ALL! I don't even care how good the marriage is.

I am not built for it.

Wasted my entire life.

But we don't give up... because in this our old age, we will make our dreams come true. 

We will not retire.

They may mock us, but do we care?

Nooooo!!!

We have our stories.

We won!

I am going to spare my children many things...

Religion. 
Nigerian humility. 
Fear.
Ageism. 
Black people's inability to own a full range of emotions. 
Conformity. 
The performance of love.
Silly trust. 
Forced forgiveness.
Submission.
.

They already know.

But I will have to reiterate these things for the rest of our lives. 

And for sport, throw in Marriage. 

Unless you really want it. I mean really really need it...

Don't do it. 

Be free, my babies. 

Be free!

Exercise your power.

Mummy says so!
