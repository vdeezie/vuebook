Some of you have marriages and relationships that are tailor-made to fit your paranoia.

Your togetherness is like a chore.

It's like timing your morning and all the tasks that should be done. You know, cleaning the gas cooker by 8:15am. Washing the tiles by 9:09am...
.

Your love is like a tidy room that lacks character. You have rolled over yourselves like flour... two of you have become one boring person, pursuing the same damn things.
.

You have hours you sit and talk. 

You have a list of dos and don'ts to make the relationship butter perfect.

You ask all the important questions. 

You psychoanalyze yourselves, constantly strengthened by how perfect every "T" is crossed. 

You mask your fear and mental disorder by claiming you are growing a healthy relationship that will not hurt you, or the other person. 

You have a list of what to do should any of you stray.

Whew!

You continue to introspect in a way that allows your brain to eat itself.

Your relationship is like a well-dressed kindergarten pupil. Not a single speck of dust on your shirt after breakfast. 

You are like a billboard for a marriage conference that teaches you how and where to fall in love.

You are a glass of Baileys with thawed ice, messing with the perfect taste of cream.

You need to breathe. 

Do you also get to time sex? 

This well groomed love, does it come with a roster for sex?

When he moans or if she cums, do you get extra marks for dessert?

Are you on a weight loss plan together?

Do you tick the days on the calendar when s/he is supposed to fart in your presence?

Breathe, abeg!

Nothing should ever be this profoundly suicidal.#Rant1819
