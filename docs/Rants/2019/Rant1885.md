Every time I hear/read this phrase: “She’s the strongest woman I know”…

I im  agine the woman living under the stronghold of Patriarchy.

You know, apologising when she isn’t wrong because she is the neck.

I imagine her waking up by 3am every morning to prepare a family for the day.

I imagine her being the breadwinner 90% of the time but parading a niggaa as the love-of-her-life who spoils-her-with-everything.

I imagine her crying herself to sleep.

I imagine her with five children and a lot of headache because she really is the only parent who does just about everything for them, yet refuses to take the credit or blow her trumpet, because humility. 

I imagine bad sex. I imagine disrespect that is overlooked because of her determination to stay married and "honoured" by society.

I imagine domestic abuse, sometimes. I imagine countless times of emotional abuse.

I imagine sexual abuse from her past that she quickly forgave.
.

Yet I imagine this woman working in an office and still getting home early enough to cook dinner for a family.

I imagine running a small business that feeds the family yet her clothes are torn.

I imagine her putting everybody first.

I imagine her husband cheating on her and she boiling with rage and wondering why he can't be faithful, afterall she has big breasts and/or ass... or or or she is such a good woman to deserve this 😂
.

And if she isn’t married, I imagine her desperate attempt to keep a man who doesn’t want to be kept.

I imagine she isn’t going to get that Prado because niggaas are going to be insecure about a single woman driving a big car.

I imagine her dumbing herself down, trying to appeal to anybody at this point who can continue to tell her she is amazing, until it leads to some kind of real commitment.

I imagine a lot of heartbreaks, and a lot of bending the rules.

I imagine loans that aren’t paid by friends.

And I imagine one of a kind pity-parties every other week with herself, a scarf on her head, her knees to the ground, tissue paper for tears, and her prayer to God to help her be society's special girl, loved by Patriarchy and left alone. 

I generally imagine a woman living a life she would rather have directed in a different way.
.
.

And when I think of that phrase, all I want to do is sleep.

Nobody ever says, “He is the strongest man I know”.

That phrase directed at women is full of sufferhead connotations. 
.
.

I have been described as a strong woman, which is always interesting because I won’t accept 99% of the life a lot of women are living! I won’t.

People say I’m strong because I can take as many e-punches and e-mobs as possible.

But you see, that’s the thing – I am probably eating cheesecake and milkshake mixed with Baileys while y’all tear your pant online.

I don’t see how a mob on a phone can possibly make me feel sad.

I’m a misanthrope, which means I don’t even like y’all in the first place, so not getting hurt by a mob is really easy for me.

I don’t want to be in your crew. I don’t want to comment on your page. I don’t want to be anybody’s G. I don't want to be your favourite anything.

I just don't care.

A mob doesn’t affect anything about my life. If it did, it’s actually positive – people pay attention to me, follow me, and a lot of business comes out of it.

So I’m not strong.

I just don’t give a fuck.

If I say I am a strong woman, I am definitely referring to the strength of my mind and no-fucks-given stance. 
.
.

I am intentionally NOT going to raise “strong African women”. Mba!

That term gets on my nerves.

I’m raising smart girls who can sniff emotional abuse from a distance, and know how to position themselves through life’s challenges.

That’s really what is required, boo.
