I have the coolest friends, aswear!

They have my phone number ooo, but when they want to register or order for any of my products or services (TAAC, Nzuri etc), they never call me. They call the official lines attached to the respective businesses. 

A friend wanted to pay for the Storytelling Workshop for Small Business Owners and Non-writers...

She called me, then she cut the line.

She called again, cut the line.

Haba.

So I called to know what was crackin'.

"Babes, what's up? You called and cut line twice."

"Sorry, Joy. I was trying to call the number for the Storytelling WhatsApp class, not you."

"But na me dey do the class, and you are my friend."

"I know. But there's a number provided for the Workshop. Make I call the right number. Make I respect business and boundaries."

Isn't that cute?

I'm surrounded by smart women.
.

Another friend called. I picked and she dropped.

Hian! What is going on today, I wondered.

A few minutes later, Roberta said my friend (she knows her) just registered for a TAAC class. 

That same friend (the second one) who called my personal number and cut the line üòÇ

Friendship is sweet only with Respect.

If you are suffering under the weight of disrespectful gutter frenemy situation... my sympathies.

I recommend you buy Nzuri body wash and scrub to wash away those toxins.

No time.

You are welcome üòÅ
