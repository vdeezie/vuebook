Told my kids they are not going to school on Monday until...

1. A president is announced. 

2. I monitor the rate of violence after the announcement 

3. Nigerians are back to their daily grind 

4. Life, as we know it, is back to normal.

By jove, Nigerian education can wait! There's nothing about it that should be so urgent to risk your life at an hour so glaringly tensed. 

A country that protects the old and destroys the young is not a country you should trust. It has no love for your children.
