I don't understand unisex toilets, to be honest. 

We want our gender privacies, biko.

You fart loudly, as you should in a toilet... after the exercise, you come out and find a hot niggaa washing his hands, and you know he heard all that private business of yours. 

First impressions should never be this way. 

Ever ðŸ¤«
.

Or just the regular exercise of changing sanitary pad... and you know the next toilet is occupied by a niggaa because you both walked into the restroom at the same time. 

He hears all the rip and replace exercise of wearing a pad... and he starts to calculate your menstrual circle for you. 
.

How about the privacy of adjusting your bra and panties in the mirror afterwards?

You are going to be doing your lady things - your skirt slightly up to smooth the lines of your pata, then one niggaa will walk in because... unisex toilet. 

Mba! Stop rough play.
.

This is especially important for bars and clubs...

Because people will get drunk. 

It makes no sense for any establishment that sells alcohol to give both sexes access to the same rest room.

I can write over one hundred ways this can go really bad, and even become a crime scene sef.

PS: I know. I know... The era of gender fluidity blurs these things. 

I know.
