Angel Aproko: God, can you see what Joy is doing?!

God: Which Joy?

Angel Aproko: Bewaji.

God: What did she write again? 

Angel Aproko: She says she wants to move to Ghana.

God: Haha! Get the angels to sing for me, will you?

Angel Aproko: God!

God: What?!

Angel Aproko: She's selling off all her things. She really wants to go.

God: Interesting.

Angel Aproko: God, she moved out of her Lekki apartment to a hotel!!!

God: I'll be damned. 

Angel Aproko: She got her flight ticket already.

God: That's the kind of faith I don't see every day.

Angel Aproko: It's crazy!

God: What does she really want?

Angel Aproko: A job. A life. Space to create art.

God: Hmm. Make it happen for her. Clear her path. 

Angel Aproko: Should I inform Satan to stay away?

(God scoffs)

God: Can you not feel the energy from this woman's faith? Nothing can stop her. She'll be all right. 

Angel Aproko: Las' Las'...

God: Play me some music, will you?

Angel Aproko: Yes, boss.
