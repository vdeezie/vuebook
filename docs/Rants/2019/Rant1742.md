I think about heterosexuality, and how much danger awaits the woman. 

It's so unfortunate. 

Half the time, they want to hurt you.

The rest of the time, they want to break you in tiny pieces.

You are beautiful, to them, only when you are broken.

They brag about how they can break or destroy you.

They brag about these things.

They make posts about their Exes... how without them these women are nothing. 

These women have left them ooo! These women have careers ooo! These women are dating other men ooo! 
Yet they talk about them constantly, with a moronic enabler beside them.
.

We are programmed to love the enemy.

This is not about men. 

This is about Patriarchy. 

This is about how mothers raise sons.

This is about the women who marry abusers and make excuses for them.

This is about every pick-me sister. 

This is about Feminism Lite.

And also, this is about toxic masculinity. 

Every thing Patriarchy said you could get just by having a penis and money... all lies.

.

And when you think about it...

How women get excited to go on a date, yet have to be aware that what/who makes her so excited can also kill her...

You realise being a heterosexual woman is one of the most dangerous positions in the world.

What we have to go through to feel safe around the gender we are programmed to love.

Sigh. 

Be safe out there.

PS: 

It's Friday, and it'll be time to unwind later...

I hope you find kindness with whomever you kiss tonight.
