Just left a client's office.
.

During the creative presentation...

I was waiting for him to respond to a PowerPoint slide before I click to the next slide.

That's how it's done - allow the client react to your presentation, slide by slide. 

I had a 32-slide presentation...

So I waited for a reaction on one of the slides...

He paused, sighed and smiled...

"I like you, Joy. You are so..."

And he paused. Sighed again, then smiled. 

"Thank you. I love your ideas a lot," he said.

"Thank you, sir. This means a lot to me."

My boss and my colleague are teasing me in the car on our way back to the office.

"Did you see how Joy was blushing? Is it because he is white that you are smiling?" My boss teased. 

"Why so jealous?" I laughed 🤣🤣🤣

I love my job! You guys have no idea!!

Bless! 🙏
