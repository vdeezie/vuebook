Watching one episode of Love Island brought back an episode in my life...

Last year, I remember having an emotional meltdown because of a job I did, and I called The Boyfriend to rant.

But he was in a meeting and couldn't respond immediately.

So I called my ex because he has some kind of appreciation for art and I could speak with him without being self-conscious. 

But he too was going through an emotional phase of his own, so he wasn't very helpful...

However, the minute I ended the not-so-helpful call, he sent me N500k.

He figured if he couldn't be there emotionally when I needed someone, money could help.

Oh! Of course. Money helps 💯💯💯 😁

The next morning, by 5.30am, The Boyfriend was at my door and he apologised because those corporate meetings take too long, especially when their foreign partners show up.

I told him what my ex did. I told him my ex sent me money at the moment of my emotional meltdown.

"Why?" He frowned. 

"Why what?" I asked.

"Why is he sending you money? Why are you taking his money?"

"Am I supposed to return it? I didn't ask him for money, I just wanted to talk."

"Why are you even calling the niggaa?" He asked.

"Because I can. Besides, you weren't picking your call."

"I don't even understand how you are attracted to someone like that," he ranted. "He's a clown. No real depth. No genuine substance. A superficial joke."

Hian!

He just kept saying "he's a clown... he's a clown." 

And I was like... "He's a clown, I agree. But what's my business? He's not my business currently." 🤷🏽‍♀️

But he wasn't listening. He was just hangry.

"The shit he says, the shit he does, the disrespect of your person, his ego, everything - clownish! Yet you take money from him. He's a clown." The Boyfriend ranted.

Na so fight start oo!
.

He disappeared for four days. 

I went shopping for four days.

The fifth day, he sent triple the amount that caused the wahala.

Actually, it was for a project I told him I wanted to do a month ago, he finally responded when he heard that someone I don't even like sent me money.

So I took the money and did the project. The project ate all the money, but I enjoyed the returns thereafter. 

I like how The Boyfriend responded when he thought someone else was in the picture.

I love my niggaa 😁😁
