When I wake up every morning, the first thing that crosses my mind is...

What can I take out of my life that will make me freer?

Who can I remove from my space to make it freer?

What relationships should I discontinue to make me freer?
.

People want to build bridges...

I'm thinking of no bridges at all so I'll have no option but to fly. 

I am all about freedom. 

I want all encumbrances out of the way. 

I want to feel so light that the wind would easily carry me away. 

I always say that having kids is a good thing for me.

Imagine me with no kids.

No. Just imagine. 

My God!!!

Nobody will be able to track me.

I'll be a bird!

A white kind lover in New York. A crazy soulmate who bonds with my art soul in London. A rich mudafucka in Spain.

My freedom would have been so offensive to conservatives, it would make me so happy.

And all I'd do is write screenplays, get called to direct movies... and watch the sunset.

Ah! My heart! üò≠‚ù§üò≠‚ù§üò≠‚ù§
