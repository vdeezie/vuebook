Have you noticed we are all saying the same thing on social media?
.
.

"Woman, you are enough."

"Be your authentic self."

"Don't let them treat you as an option."

"You are beautiful."
.

Err... what else?

"Do not let anyone steal your happiness."

"Nobody can make you feel small unless you give them permission."

"You will find someone who'll treat you like a queen."
.
.

*Yawn*

Binches, please!

I'm so fvcking bored.
.
.

That's why I am on Snapchat.

It's like an empty country. 

Nobody is there anymore

The hype is gone. 

It's perfect.

PS: Plix don't add me on Snapchat. I see all of you. Leemeealone ðŸ™„
