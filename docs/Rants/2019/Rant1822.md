Nigerian wives are saying we should allow them to live their lives however they wish, under their own unique rules of their Nigerian marriages. 

Haq haq haq haq haq.

Why?

Because one Francis dude has promised to take one of them to Venice, and he also promised to dash their poor AF husband N700k after he returns the wife!!!

😂😂😂😂

For shame! See how these women quickly shift the table!

The problem with most Nigerian married women is jealousy.

The bulk of them hardly ever feel desirable. They don't travel. They don't receive gifts from admirers. They cannot flirt without masking it in secrecy. 

They cannot do many things openly. 

They are lonely as fvck. Horny as fvck. And broke as fvck. 

The bulk of them.

So when these women become misogynists, hating their gender...

What they really hate is themselves. 

The minute you are married in Nigeria, your freedom is gone. 

Add religion, and you become a doormat. 

So when they see a woman that is free indeed, they call her a prostitute. 

Nigerian Married Women are the strongholds and pillars of Patriarchy. They are the foundation for Misogyny. 

They want us all to be married to average AF men, and when we rebel, they tell us we will die lonely 🤣🤣🤣🤣

These are the women trying to justify a MARRIED NIGERIAN WOMAN going on a vacation with a man who is not their husband, after the niggaa would have compensated the poor husband with N700k.

I mean... the insult!!! 😂😂😂

The fvcking insult!

Nobody does anything for married women, at least not openly, lest they are caught and made  to parade in the village naked! 😂😂😂

These women lowkey want our lives.

They hate to say it.

See them defending this disgusting offer.

You better sit at home and continue to make eba for your husband...

Because if you go on that trip... You are a prostitute!

And if your husband receives that money... He is a pimp!

What kind of transactional nonsense is this?

One man has made side chicks of all of you with just one post.

And you are defending it because you want to go to Venice. 

Ashawo kobo kobo! 😂😂😂

Sit at home, ma'frien! And take care of your kids! Nonsense!

Who will take care of hubby and junior when you travel?

What is wrong with you?!

You are supposed to travel only with your husband... or with female friends. Or alone. Or not at all.
.

Poverty die by fire!

How dare you open the nyashes of these virtuous married women.

Ehn?

I see your trueeeee colouuuuur! 🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶
