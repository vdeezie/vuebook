I have a one-week leave from work for every quarter. 

The Boyfriend has booked a hotel for me on the Island for a week. He won't be in town but he got that sorted before traveling. 

If he was in town, he would have killed me with that Beyonce album. On repeat until I drown 😂

Thank God for small mercies fa! 🤣

I'm actually excited to visit Lagos for the following reasons...

1. Edikaikong and pounded yam

2. White rice and NIGERIAN stew ooo! Phew!

2. Cookies and cream icecream, Amarula and Oreos

3. Cinema!!! Lagos movie culture is lit!

And of course, my beautiful daughters 😍

... then I'm outta there faster than the speed of light 🤧

Dinner is just me. 

A simple Barcelos meal.

No fine dining tonight, 'cos nigga is running late to spend his money.

Enjoy your weekend, y'all! 😘
