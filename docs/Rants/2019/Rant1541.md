Today, I employed an assistant for my assistant.

😁😁😁

We've grown in such a short time and our businesses are bursting at the seams.

I realised my manager, Roberta, wasn't finding enough time to even sleep!

Running all our small businesses takes all our time.

So I decided she should get her own Assistant.

"Hire someone. I will pay her salary. But I don't want to have anything to do with her directly," I said.

She held the interview with a few persons by herself last week.

She told me she picked someone - a young lady.

"Why her?" I asked.

"She has ENTHUSIASM," Roberta said.

We laughed. She's learning fast from me.

No enthusiasm, no room for you in my corner of the world. I don't care the degree you have. 

The world is gloomy. I deserve some energy around me to be able to make it through each day.

I remember last year, I told Roberta...

"When we speak on the phone, I want ENTHUSIASM! When I walk into the office, I want ENERGY. When I share ideas with you, I want EXCITEMENT busting through every pore on your skin... else we will not last very long."

Roberta is the only person in the entire world that I share my ideas with the minute I conceive them in my mind.

I call her immediately ideas drop in my spirit. 

And I have told her, when I share my ideas, I want her response to be exciting at first. When we meet up, we can then dissect the possibility of growing this idea to a business.

My most common sentence in the office is...

"I have an idea."

When I say that, Roberta starts to dance like those cele worshippers.

I love it!

Her attitude has helped me to fearlessly do things.

I groomed her to be enthusiastic for the benefit of our working relationship.

I don't talk to anyone else about my ideas until I proceed with the idea.

I am grateful for this young lady.

Imagine living my life all these years and denied the enthusiasm that should come with my ideas.

Everyone putting fear above your idea.

Not anymore!

For someone like me full of ideas, it has been a lonely life until I hired Roberta.

So yes. Let her have her own assistant. 

All the businesses I started this year happened ONLY because she danced whenever I said...

"I have an idea."

We live deliberately. 

Bless.
