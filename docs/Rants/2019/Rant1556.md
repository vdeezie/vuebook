People must understand that the Miracles of this world (BB Naija #DoubleWahala winner) does not owe them any explanation.

Miracle doesn't want to be a celebrity. 

He doesn't want to trend.

He doesn't care about followers and likes.

He is not going to intentionally pay for popularity. 

He doesn't want to act. He doesn't want to sing.

He doesn't want photoshoots. He doesn't want to be on a red carpet. 

He doesn't want to wear Mai Atafo. He doesn't want to be your fashion inspiration. 

He doesn't want to come for your shows.

He doesn't want to be pals or chummy with people. 

I'm sure whatever extra he is doing on his platform has a content provider behind it.

He doesn't want to be in a WhatsApp group with some Alumni of a reality show that is done and dusted.

Miracle wants to move on with his life.
.

Just because he is different doesn't make him fake or arrogant.

It is your scrutiny of him that makes you arrogant and silly.

The man came for one thing - to win.

Niggaa won. And all he wants to do is fly - literally.

But simpletons want him to fit into Instagram crowd or into a WhatsApp group.

We can't all be interested in the same things.

And when you see someone in 2019 so brazenly different, show some respect.

Because the default is to blend in.
.

I stan rebellion. I stan the right to be different...

I stan misfits. I stan square pegs in a round ass world.

I stan.

Period.
