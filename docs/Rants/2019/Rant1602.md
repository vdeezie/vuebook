Many moons ago, I told Roberta to buy me two buckets from Ebeano supermarket.

Three days later, I found out one of them was leaking.

I fill the buckets with water, but when I come back from work, one of them is always half empty (half full for oversabi people).

I shrugged and moved on.

Regardless of its handicap, I still fill up the bucket with water every morning.
.

Months later, I realised the bucket wasn't leaking anymore.

For real oo!

Bucket stopped leaking.

I would come back from work to meet a full bucket of water.

So I looked at the sky and asked the Lord.

"Father, is this a sign?"

I did not hear anything. But I suspect it is a sign that I will lust after a man with a mouth that stays shut.

A closed mouth is one of the fine assets a man can own.

Lord, I receive!

Halleluuu!
