One of the questions my boss asked during our conversation (he refused to call it an interview. Lol!) was...

"What are the first steps you'll take as a top management creative in a new company?

I told him I'll observe the internal politics, and break them.

"Woah! Why?" He asked. 

"Because it destroys everything."

Internal politics is usually orchestrated by the most insecure and the least productive employees.

The politics offers comfort - a safe place for mediocrity to thrive. 

As childish as it appears, internal politics has the potential to destroy an organisation. 

-Because organisations are made of people, and the engineers of internal politics understand the power of small minds coming together to distract, offend, and in some cases threaten... all of these affect growth. 

It's like a fvcking rash on your thigh...

If you don't buy that 5 cedis ointment to cure it, it will spread and become a 1000 cedis problem.

I break cliques. It's that simple. I break them. 

I want to see how much value and spunk you have as an individual, standing alone without the crutches of a caucus.

Only when internal politics is understood, addressed and annihilated can we proceed to  become gods - creators of art.

PS: Intrapreneurship rocks!

PSS: I'm a proud as fvck intrapreneur.

PSSS: Good morning!
