I am going to give you necessary advice:

If you are in the Arts...

Stay the hell away from people who say Art will leave you poor.

I did.

I threw them all away.
.
.

I don't like buying-and-selling...

I don't like trade...

I don't enjoy archetypal entrepreneurship...

I don't enjoy a lot of things.

I enjoy Art.

I really really enjoy Art.

I enjoy scriptwriting. I enjoy being a creative director. I absolutely love being a brand strategist. I love being a playwright...

And, by jove, I'm going to love being a director!

To make money from what you enjoy is the best thing that can happen to your life. 

You need to know what you want for yourself. 

When I went to London, I would see a Play every day. That was what made me happy.

Art makes me happy.

Art gives me financial stability. 
.
.

There's a lot of distraction online. 

And as much as all these things people do are  valid... I want none of it.

That was my struggle for more than two years. 

I struggled to believe I wanted to be something else.

And it left me depressed. 
.

Let me write it plainly...

Art heals me every day. Clothes me every day. Honours me every day. Preserves my dignity every day. Keeps me happy every day.

Art is for my soul, my ego and my pocket.

Art takes care of all my bills.

And the things I can't take care of, The Boyfriend is there to handle it.

-Because having a relationship like the one we have is pure Art. 

Have a good day y'all.
