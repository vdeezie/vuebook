Sometimes, the most unfortunate position is being a heterosexual woman. 

Most times, actually. 

Yes, I said it!

To be constantly shamed, hurt, mocked, and harmed by the gender you are attracted to is, indeed, an unfortunate way to live. 

When you leave them, they troll you, hate you passionately, try to break you at every chance they get, write and say shit about you constantly. 

If you are not strong enough their hate and ego will crush you. 

Yet this is the gender you are sexually programmed to love, to desire. 

It is unfortunate. 

They will take your most private moments and label it... labeling you.

It is tiring.

How a BLACK man tries to shame a BLACK woman's skin complexion, under the despicable guise of "comedy", is something that cannot be fathomed.

I fear for heterosexual women. 

I fear for us.

I worry.

The hate, the discrimination, the lack of respect, the constant breaking and shaming...

It's scary.

This fool called a Ebiye is a pig.

And that thing on his face happened to him when he gave another pig fellatio in the mud.

Even a gilt will not allow his filth come near it.

This fvcking animal is not worthy to lace Lupita's shoe.
