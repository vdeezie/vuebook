#GhanaChronicles 06

"Ghanaians are slow."

Nigerians says this. Ghanaians say this.

Is this a myth?

'Cos I'm yet to meet one slow Ghanaian... 

And I have met more people, been in more meetings in just 4 working days in Ghana than I have in the last two years in Lagos.

No joke.

And I'm the one trying to catch up, especially with time.

I was late to a meeting a few days back.

They all just looked at me like...

"Here comes the Nigerian with her swag, her energy, and lateness."

😭😭😭
.

I asked an FB friend for a contact to help me through an important door... she gave me
7 different contacts of 7 different top individuals in less than 10 minutes. 

Nigerians don't do that. 

They hoard their shit like they need to make a bed of all their contacts.
.
.

I got a random call...

Well, not random per se. My profile is everywhere and he was responding to it.

"Your name came up in a meeting. Can you meet me at the office?"

The voice sounded so important.

"Huh?"

"In 10 minutes."

"Um..."

"Are you driving?"

"No."

"Someone will pick you up."

I was like a character from a movie rolling out of the house 😂
.
.

Then there's the crazy and exciting conversation I had with someone who drove me around town.
.
.

Then hanging out with one of the ambitious men I have ever met at Achimota Golf Club.

"Do you play golf?" He asked. 

"No. Never even crossed my mind."

"You have to learn golf. I'll teach you."
.

I haven't yet met the slow Ghanaians.

Hopefully I don't. 

My experience right here is golden.
.
.

PS: I notice average Ghanaians like to comment under my posts when tagged by others to vent their inferior position as it compares to the Ghana I am experiencing.

Please stop. 

Like I always tell Nigerians, "I am not one of you."

I am not one of any group of persons.

I only allow myself to experience life with the best stock of humans.

It is a choice to be discerning.

Ok! Off to watch cool niggaas play golf 😁
