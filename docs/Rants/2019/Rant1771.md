The real joy to my life is that no man will celebrate 25 years of marriage with me and share the story of how I suffeeeered with him, went through hell for him, swam through deep waters, forgave him when he cheated, fed him when he was lazy and hungry, gave him money when he was broke...

And he'd end this sermon by confessing that he should have treated me better... yapping about me deserving better.

Then everybody will start clapping.

Then pictures will be posted online.

Then stupid comments about how sweet and patient this love is.

Then I'll wipe a tear from my cheek, nodding my head, finally accepting my reward and praise from society.

Then one pastor with his filthy hands will bless us with another 25 years of suffering, sorry, blessing.
.
.

I thank the Lord that will never ever be my story.

Never.

We move.
