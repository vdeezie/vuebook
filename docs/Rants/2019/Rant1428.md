All I can think about in this Jeff Bezos situation is...

25 years!

WTF!

Marriage is like a facking tree!

Just stays there and grows. Then dies.

Dude wanted to move a little...

So he branched out.

Oh lighten up! Those ones crying more than the "bereaved". Stronging face on top another man's divorce. 

Dude is the wealthiest man in the world.

There's no sorrow here.

Dude is rich.

Wife just made a k.i.l.l.i.n.g.

Life is good.

Don't feel sorry for him or her. Feel sorry for all your dreams that will n.o.t come true because you don't have jack. Feel sorry for your akant balance.

I don't have time analyzing the love life of a rich man.

Monogamy is the only problem here.

I've always said this.

But let's just carrying on like it's the cutest thing in the world.
