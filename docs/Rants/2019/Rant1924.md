I gave bureau de change N300,000 in Accra...

He said that would be 3,980 ghana cedis only.

Kai!

Naira everywhere, but only worth a few thousand cedis.
.

I begged the guy for better rates...

He eventually gave me at 4,200 cedis.

I was grateful. 
.

Then I had N530 left. I begged him to do anything.

He took the money and gave me 10 cedis.

It is actually worth less than that.

I think N500 is worth 7 cedis.

Bwahahahahahhaha!!!

Naija I hail oo! 😭😭😭
.

N500 is worth less than 10 ghana cedis.

N300,000 is just 4,000 cedis... after begging oo!

😭😭😭

Na wa!
.

When I got to Accra, I went Christmas shopping at the mall for foodstuff and groceries...

I haff kuku spent half of the money.

Makes me wonder how these pick-mes in Nigeria cook soup with N1,500.

Strange species.

💅💅
.

I need more cedis in my life.

The money disappears too quickly.

Let me go and write Ghollywood script 😁
