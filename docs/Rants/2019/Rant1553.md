Oh! Forgot to mention...

Roberta sacked her Assistant four days after she started work.

😂😂😂

"Why?" I asked.

"She has no drive."

"How?" I asked.

"She mentioned her sister does not like how stressed she looked after work each day. So I told her to go and sit at home with her sister."

😂😂😂

No time.

I had nothing to do with this, I promise. Lol!

I saw that Assistant only once. I made her none of my business 😂

Everywhere I've worked, I'd always been given the privilege to employ my own writers away from the approval or scrutiny of my bosses.

At Happenings Media, I didn't just get my writers, I built my entire team.

So I am extending that platform to my own Assistant, because there is an emotional satisfaction that comes with the power to recruit who you think is best suited to interpret your own job.

It's the kind of power a good employee should be allowed to nurture and enjoy for the benefit of the company.

Ah well! She'll find another one 😁
