Gratitude Post:

My return ticket from Ghana to Lagos this July, and back to Ghana...

My children's return ticket from Lagos to Ghana this July...

My children's ticket back to Lagos after the holidays in September...

My return ticket from Lagos back to Ghana (after dropping the kids in school by September)...

Back-to-back-to-back-to-back...

Every damn naira paid, in advance, by The Boyfriend.

Whew. 

What a man!

I write these "The Boyfriend" posts every now and then so that if I ever get too excited with my life and forget how AMAZING this man is to me (regardless of my flaws)...

Let the world never forget.

Dear World,
There is a man who lives solely to please me.

And considering the dynamics of the relationship, I feel so unworthy. 

Thank you, good man.

Thank you ‚ù§
