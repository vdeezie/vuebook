I watched a series till 3am this morning because I had to experience the scene where the man tells the woman...

"I love you"... or when they kiss... or something romantic.

I watched five extra episodes to get to that scene.

I was eager, sleep had left me, my eyes wide open, I didn't know when I finished a pack of chocomilo...

The waiting was intense. 

And when they finally got to the scene where they kissed, it was worth the wait. 

He was waiting for her at her door after work. He was blabbing a bunch of incoherent crap. She let him in. 

He tells her, "I love you." As if it is a bad thing. As if this love tortured him. As if the love stole his peace.

He pins her to the door and they kiss.

I drop one more chocomilo in my mouth and my eyes were moist with tears.

I waited 2 hours to watch that scene. 

Then another extra 45 minutes to know what they did with the love they found. 
.
.

Notice how the screenwriter made me follow that story, amidst other great stories in the series... s/he made me wait for hours to appreciate his/her art, and the time s/he chose for love to happen.

That confidence the screenwriter exhibits in making me wait all night (and filling my belly with saccharine snack), is what makes for great writing. 

Never rush the love scenes.

People are more interested in the cues, subtlety and processes leading to love.

Make them wait.
