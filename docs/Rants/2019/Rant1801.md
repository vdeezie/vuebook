People who say...

"You never know what is out there, cherish what you have."

Always make me laugh. 

What are you afraid of?

That they would actually go out there and find something beautiful?
.

I mean... cherish what you have, but don't even trip - there are many more special experiences out there. 

Imagine if someone ever told me not to leave my marriage because "you don't know what is out there"...

I'll probably be selling fufu along Orile by now (because my self-esteem would have been trampled upon for the benefit of marriage). My kids would probably be in public school. I would never have travelled. I would be so depressed to think about self care. And I'll be suffering the worst case of emotional abuse. 

But I'm out here, living my life like a beautiful chapter from a book.

My life is an amazing story because I didn't know what was out there waiting for me, but I took the plunge, anyway!

I always search for more depth to my life.

I always move. 

Period.

"You don't know what is out there..."

Really? 

Frankly, I don't trust people who talk like that.

They are myopic. And could easily be described as cowards.

I'll call them wicked, because they stop others from living life as it should be lived - free.

Fvck fear! Fvck limitation. Fvck simplistic blackmail. 

We move.

As we should.
