My mother was a tough woman in marriage, emotionally.

She never displayed hurt.

She displayed anger but not hurt that her husband cheated constantly.

I mean... my father owned hotels. Some of them he built from scratch - laid the foundation. That was how personal his businesses were.

Some of his hotels had chic brothels (it was the thing in the 80s).

My father was a big distributor of Nigerian Breweries products - alcohol was 90% his interest as a distributor.

He ran clubs and bars. 
I even heard a bit of stripper clubs and stuff, but I never saw that particular establishment. 

But I know my dad, and I know he was very liberal when it came to his masculine choices. 

My mother knew him this way. He didn't pretend to be a church boy or a humble business man interested in, errr, selling cement.

No.

Funnily, he didn't go out very often. He created a lifestyle around his businesses... and those businesses were quite the entertainment for him.

So... when you marry a man like my father, it is clear that you will have to deal with his excesses... or don't marry a man like that at all.

My father had women. He was a serial monogamist. Full attention for one woman for a few years, then he goes for another experience with another woman.

And as an adult now, I see nothing wrong with that.

Of course, as a child I was made to believe this was wrong by everyone else.

I think my mother was the longest relationship he had, because she made it seem like she didn't give a f*ck.

But she did! You see, that is the problem. She did but she never made it known... like it was a cool thing to be so hurt, yet so nonchalant about it.

In all of this, it was obvious my mum detested his lifestyle, but she never showed hurt. She displayed her disgust and all, but not hurt.

All what she felt - all that hurt she must have felt, she pumped it into her business.

Now, this is where y'all will start clapping that she won! "YAY!!! Boss lady moves!"

I don't agree. 

Your business doesn't quench emotional pain. 

My mother yapped about my father's lifestyle for decades!!! I had to hear that sh*t everyday of my growing life!

She became comfortable channelling her hurt to her business, but the hurt never truly left.

Her financial stability didn't stop the hurt from festering for years even after the divorce.

I see many women like my mum, channelling their hurt to their businesses.

Good.

But not good enough.

These women are still very married, yet very bitter.

You smell it in their utterances. And they camouflage it with, errr, winning at business.

Sigh.

If you are truly going to be happy, you need to have an HONEST conversation with your spouse about what you want.

And you see, it is not only about what YOU want, it is also about what HE wants.

Don't marry a man and then try to change him OR become cold towards his ways.

Most importantly, don't have an agreement before marriage or at the start of marriage and then become bitter afterwards. 

Do not pretend it is ok to have an open marriage when you know you truly want that man all to yourself or vice versa.

You are hurting yourself, and it shows.

At least people like me who are very discerning can SEE. We can see past the smokescreen.

You can try to shield pain with colours. Hurt is stronger than anything you become. It's in everything you carry - even your smile. Those lines around your smile are lines of hurt.

Hurt is even in the business and growth you keep yapping about. It is all around you.

You need to heal. Release yourself. 

Go to your spouse and have a sincere conversation about what hurts you.

Stop acting superwoman.

Ain't no superwoman in this mudafucka. 
.

My mother never tried to change my father which was good. Because you can't change a man. You can't change anyone.

Monogamy is a social construct and niggaa knew this long before it even became a thing.

But what my mother did was conceal her hurt and acted like it was ok.

Deep down, she wasn't ok with it.

Like many of you.

What kind of life do you want to have nodding to everything your spouse says because of peace, yet despising everything he does?

And what kind of life do you want to have trying to change for someone whom you should have sincerely communicated the kind of marriage you wish to have.

You will eventually kill yourselves.

Bitterness is poison. Hurt is a garrote.

Somebody will die.

And death isn't just physical.#Rant1450
