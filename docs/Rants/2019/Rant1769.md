Jolly microwaved her part of chicken until it turned to ashes. 
.

"Jolly, your chicken smells burnt."

"Not at all, it's perfect."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes, yes."

Not convinced, I go to the kitchen to see the chicken.

It only looked like the thigh of chicken until I felt it... then it turned to ashes right in my hand.

The residue of zero wife material ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

"Did you cremate the chicken or what?"

"What is cremate?"

"You have read up to 500 books, you haven't stumbled on cremation?"

"Mummy, I can't remember."

"So you want to eat ashes because you do not want to be scolded! Ma'fren, will you throw that thing away and microwave another one with the right settings?!"
.

Zero wife material is perfect, but wasting my chicken is a No!
