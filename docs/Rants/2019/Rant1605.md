When you see 'Avengers: Endgame'...

You know this is it.

This is the religion.

This is what Jesus died for.

This is why we are here.

This level of creativity... of imagination is what God created us for.

You may not feel this way in another 10 years.

This Art outdid itself.

.

A good movie is a bunch of emotions around a story. 

Hollywood understands this.

Nollywood doesn't have a farting idea what this means.
.

You know how you sob and your heart quavers... your body vibrates... 

That was me a moment ago.

This is what this movie does to you.
.
.

I am not grateful that I am here in this time in history. 

No.

I am angry and ashamed.

I watch movies like this and I feel the rush of shame. A flood of shame swallow me.

We are spectators in this world.

And this makes me really ashamed.

And angry.

Angry because you know you can do this... you can create excellence.

What has stopped me? 

I've been writing for an industry that cannot tell if "a chip on the shoulder" is a figure of speech OR someone actually has to carry a bag of cement on his shoulder. 

I am so angry. So ashamed. So tired.

It would be blasphemy to say that we are equals with the West.

I am ashamed that I have stayed believing a country very comfortable in its delusion and mediocrity would ever change.
.

Let me go and sit somewhere and let that experience sink in.
