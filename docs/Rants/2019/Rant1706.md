One woman with the intellect of a turkey is always subbing me 🤷🏽‍♀️

I mean... first it was amusing because she always seemed to be near the toilet I use trying to smell my shit so she can announce it on social media.

I laugh at her attempts because... how am I going to fight someone without basic education nah? 

Zero comprehension. The leftover of an obsolete era.

So I let her be. She gets content from my rants and manage to curate them to suit her boring agenda.

Yet the subbing still hasn't made her popular

Today, I blocked her.

Why?

She subbed me AGAIN, and said I needed Jesus... yet this neanderthal couldn't get more  than 1 like on her post since yesterday night!!!

How can you sub me and get just 1 like???

How?

That ain't good for my e-reputation.

Please get lost!

Your mates are baking cake as sub gift, and you are there trying to get my attention with 1 like.

An obsession.

Hoping she could be me.

You ain't got it. You don't have it. You nor be am at all.

And you can't sit with us.

PS: E go pain am die 😂
