To my tribe on Facebook...

We changed the narrative on this app.

We questioned Patriarchy without fear. 

We criticised the privileges of men.

We gbas gbos all the silly pick-mes.

We are without shame.

We gave new connotations to tags that were meant to shame us - bitch, whore, ashawo, bitter et al. 

We are not afraid.

We ripped out labels.

We stand as individuals, no stamps. 
.

Our daughters will read us...

They will first be shocked by our audacities...

But as they grow older, they will understand. 
.

We brought our "fight" to social media...

And if you will look around these e-streets, you will see the impact we have made - the discomfort our voices have caused. 

We are disruptive. 

We are the crazy ones.

We are rebels.

Our daughters will be proud.
