I get to immigration...

After scanning my bags, the madam at the check point takes my handbag aside and asks about the "black bulky nylon".

"What is inside that nylon?"

"Money," I respond.

She adjusts excitedly.

"How much?"

"Three hundred thousand."

Ah! Now she is fanning herself.

"Oya, come to this corner and explain why you..."

"Madam, relax. It's three hundred thousand NAIRA. Change from my Lagos vacation."

I see her disappointment. It makes me very happy 😁

"Go!" She sighs.
.

Sorry, you hear? Even I would have preferred to have the money in my bag in dollars.
