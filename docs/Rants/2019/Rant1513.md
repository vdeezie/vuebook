My followers always ask me: “Joy, how do you do it all? How do you find the time to do everything?”

Some are bothered that I may burn out.

There was an argument on a random post I found.

Commenter A wrote, “Wow! Joy does so much. I hope she finds time for herself?”

Commenter B responded, “Don’t you see how she glows. She finds time for herself oh!”

Commenter A then said, “But how does she do it and still look so good?” Then she used crying emoji to express her confusion 😭

I know this is all coming from a good place because my followers are the bestest!

So here is my little secret on how I do so much in 24 hours and still manage to look, well, good 😁:

1. I don’t cook. That means I do not go to the market. That’s 3+ hours saved in a week of my life. Hours I can dedicate to something else.

2. I don’t do my laundry. I have a mobile laundry executive that picks my clothes every week. That saves me another 3+ hours of washing. A f*cking random zero-reward routine. It had to go!

3. I don’t have friends. I don’t hang out with women. I don’t do girls-out. What that means is: I am not roped into any frenemy bullcrap. I don’t have to constantly explain myself to any friend like most women do. I am not in the business of Likeability. I sincerely do not give a f*ck about a lot of things. 
The act of not-giving-a-fuck detoxifies, purifies and exfoliates… like Nzuri (please place your orders and be like me 😁)

Do you know how much hours you can save when you don't do cliques? It's priceless!

Ok what else?

4. I don’t sweat a lot of things, especially relationship with men. I will not allow myself wither like a leaf because of a man. I will rise. I bounce back fast. I move on quickly. It is an art I have perfected. Because whilst you are killing yourself, niggaa is living his life and moving on. So should you.

5. I am not part of any WhatsApp group, except my children’s school WhatsApp group which is perpetually on mute. And I make no contributions there. You save 1000+ hours of your life if you are not engaging on WhatsApp.

6. Family do not intrude in my life. I see my mum when I want to. I call my brother when I want to. I am not obligated to come for any family meeting or become someone else to please anyone.

7. I am not on twitter. Whew! I simply abandoned my account and left that aging product behind. That's one less app to worry about.

8. I do not hate any woman. I do not love any man (except one). So I am not wishing any woman evil and in the process turning into a wrinkled witch. And I am not lusting over any man. Except one. I mentioned that already. And I will tell you I love you. I have no shame. Shamelessness is detoxifying also. You should try it. 
Hate is time-consuming. Not hating saves you a lot of time that you can use in more productive ways. 

9. I take sex seriously, so I do not condone bad sex. I save it for the right loving… I don’t care how long it takes. We are not going to be faking orgasm at 41!

10. Patriarchy has given up on me, so I do not worry about the things average women worry about. 

I am the one who got away.

11. I am not addicted to anything. Ok, ice cream, but I am working on it.

12. I don’t do red carpets so I don’t have to spend hours looking for a dress to slay in.

13. I don’t do pretentious Lekki camaraderie.

So with all of these out of the way, my 24 hours is free and available for thinking, creating and executing and resting.

I sleep by 1am every morning. I wake up by 6.30am and work on my bed till 9am. The hours on my bed with my laptop and my tranquillity, trumps anything I’ll achieve for the rest of the day.

14. Lastly, I was greatly inspired by my last boss to believe that anything is possible. He didn’t directly mentor me, but I allowed his work ethics influence me. Imagine if we all allow people indirectly influence us. Instead of paying attention to their flaws, pay attention to their strengths.

And that, my people, is how I got my groove back.
