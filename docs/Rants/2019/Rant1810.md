This rant is titled: Miracle at Lunch 😁
.

It’s been a busy week, but very fulfilling.

So I took myself out.

I went for fine dining this afternoon during lunch time.

As I was eating jejely, my boss and awon shareholders walked in, and I went over to greet them.

They remember the Nigerian woman nah! As per all the wahala I cause in the office. All the gist they haff been hearing. 
Yes, na me be dis. Hallo! 😂

I went back to my seat to ravish my jollof rice and grilled chicken and oreos milkshake. Yum! 😋

My bill was 65 ghc.

I paid. But as I was leaving the restaurant, the waitress gave me back my money and said awon shareholders haff settle the bill.

I happy gan. Because cedis is a very valuable currency kraaaa!
.

Let me explain how much 65 ghc lunch is for you Nigerians using that thing called naira…

Regular meals cost 10 ghc per lunch. 

65 ghc is lunch for one whole week, with a spill over of one-and-half days into a new week.

See? It is not a small som’tin.

Ese gan, shareholders of life!
.

I am going to keep this my 65 ghc and buy som’tin for Emilia next weekend.

My babe! I haven't seen her in a while. We both have been very busy. And she is learning golf at the moment. Big babes tinz! 😘
.

This weekend, I have 9 episodes of a series to conclude, so I can move on to the next series.

That is 270 pages of scenes and dialogue.

I will not see the sun until Monday.

Oh! Monday is a holiday here in Ghana!

Life is good jare! 😊❤
