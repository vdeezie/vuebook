I'm having this phone conversation, and I am fully present in the moment.

I am wholly involved. 

I feel everything.
.
.

I. Miss. Y.o.u.

I. Love. You.

Your. Smell. Is. All. O.v.e.r. Me.

I. Ask. M.y.se.lf. What. Is. Happening. To. Me.

You. Exc.ite. Me.

I. Want. To. Travel. With. Yo.u.

I. Want. To. Hol.d. You. 

Can. We. Have. Dinner. Tomor.row. 
.
.

The words break into alphabets, swimming in the air, galloping and leaping excitedly, hoping I would pluck some and chew into my soul, to the relish of my heart.

I am present.

I feel the texture of his voice through the phone. 

I feel his heart racing. 

I feel his excitement and joy and hopes and willingness...

And I understand, because I have been there before. I can show empathy and not ruin this moment when a young man, after two weeks of spending time together, has a lot to say.
