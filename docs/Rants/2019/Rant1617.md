I just watched a commercial from the 60s. 

It says...

"Unlike other deodorants, Fresh doesn't promise you eternal romance... Fresh simply keeps you fresh."

Abi oo! No long story 😁😁😁

Simplicity always wins.

One of my favourite Ads when I was a little girl was Avis Car Rentals.

It goes something like this:

"We are not number 1. We are number 2 and that is OK." (see pix)

As a child I was curious and impressed... because every dumb creative director was writing shitty Ads about being number one.

It was boring.

Every single product was bragging. Then came Avis claiming number two position, and it stood out!

It was cocky. And the competitors hated them for that. For daring to claim a subordinate position, they pronounced their brand superior.

Brilliant!

By claiming number two, Avis made number one position seem inferior.

Love it. Love it.

The audacity to remove itself from the dull bragging was so disrespectful to the culture, it was glorious!

😂😂😂😂

That Ad is still as brilliant now as it was back then when I was a child, reading my father's papers.

Read the Ad pix below.

Almost four decades later, Nigerians still don't know anything about good copies and creative content.

When we try for simplicity, we fail to plug in the most essential ingredient of creating simple content - percipience.

We are dull in every way.

You know America is a sh*tty country, right?

You have no idea!

The stuff that goes on there will shock you. Corporate PR has not been able to save America for a while. Because if something is bad or pretentious, you can't hide it for very long.

Do you know what saves America?

Its creative industry. Its Art. 

Hollywood is the best PR America has.

Without Hollywood, America is nothing. 

We respect that country because we are enamoured of its Art and creativity. 

We watch Avengers, and we cry. 

We watch Game of Thrones, and we hold on to our chests.

We say to ourselves, "Ah! God bless America."

The movies we watch are not the story of America. 

Of course not!

It is the world of make-believe. It is escapism.

It is Art.

Not politics. Just good ol' Art.

And if you perfect your escapism... you perfect, to a good extent, the perception of your country.

Look at Nollywood.

Look at those who have the resources to do something. 

See what they are doing with the resources at their disposal.

Lazy Art.
