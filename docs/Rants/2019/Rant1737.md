You dey manage your life for Ketu, inside one small room, with one small hole wey be like window. 

You dey manage your N31,968 salary for factory wey you dey work for Oshodi. 

You dey manage love wey you dey do with Ramotu.
.

Sars don beat you before. Soldier don slap you last year. Your landlord troway your load for inside gutter dat time wey you owe four months' rent...

You and areaboy don fight for bus stop, tear cloth many times. Armed robbers don waylay you for express before. Yahoo boy don dupe you of N10k, you beat am you almost kill am...
.

You dey stay inside traffic every day for three hours just to go work. Your boss dey owe you three months' salary. 

NEPA don uproot the wire wey dey supply light for your area, dem say una dey owe plenty money. 

You dey queue every day to use toilet and bathroom. 

Your room dey leak. Your neighbour don accuse you say you dey fvck him wife.

Nothing wey you never suffer for dis Lagos.
