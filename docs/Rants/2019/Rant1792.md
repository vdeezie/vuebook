Dear Cosmic,

Remember that I had a wealthy father and I took nothing from him, except the experience of being his daughter.

Even when his last woman and her children, my father's siblings and cousins all dragged his possession and money... I wasn't involved. 

When they illegally sold his houses and started businesses... I didn't hustle for any of it.

When my half-sister called me to go and fight for what was mine... I said, No.

I didn't desecrate my father's legacy.

I refused to reduce my father to pay cheque.

I have never reduced anybody to a pay cheque.

I have loved genuinely. 

I add value. 

I give as much as I receive.

I have never been a hustler. 

I genuinely care for people's businesses.

I have given my best in my capacity in any position I hold within the structure of alloted power.

I am a good person. 

I have dignity and integrity.

And for this, I see how you make everything work out for my good.

When a door closes you open ten doors!

You have never given enough time to watch me bow.
.

Remember my children.

As you have always come through for me, dear God, come through for my kids.

As I scribble an unconventional future for them, help me get it right.

Their time is almost here.

I need you, dear God.

Thanks.
