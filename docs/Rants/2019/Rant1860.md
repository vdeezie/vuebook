Roberta picks and/or drops my kids in school every time the school informs parents of a break...

She buys them food, takes them to the supermarket to get whatever they want and drops them at my mum's.

All I need to do is send her money.

Money, by itself, cannot accomplish this feat.

But Nigerians will tell me one uncle somewhere is more important to me than Roberta...

Because "family".

I laugh in gedifok.

The Boyfriend picks and/or drops my kids in school.

He has paid school fees five times. When he takes them shopping, they shop like they're about to close the shop.

He paid for my kids to experience Dubai, paid for their trip to Accra... and many more amazing things money can solve. 

But someone will tell me that one aunty's advice should be more important to me than The Boyfriend's...

Because "family".

I laugh in silly-twat.

I'd easily choose "strangers" over "family".

EASILY. 

Family is a verb.

Many people who think they are "family" do not matter.

I will walk right through them on a street. 

I am not about this kind of sentimental BS.

People who make my life easy are family. Periodttt.
