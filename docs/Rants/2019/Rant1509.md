This is my mood every time a Nigerian marriage trends.

Whether he beats you... whether he throws you out of the house... he chokes you with your bra... he cheats... he impregnates the maid...

Whether you are pretending to be happy or actually happy... whether you take family selfies or don't share any personal info online... 

Whether he tells you to stay at home and don't go clubbing... whether he emotionally blackmails your entire family by threatening to jump off a bridge whilst pronouncing you a prostitute... whether he claims you are not cooking for him... whether you cry... whether you stay because of the kids... or stay for sex... 

Whether you fight side chick... sub side chick... call side chick out on social media...

Whether you are working it out or not working it out... whether you give second chances or ultimatums... 

Whether you are the one feeding his sorry ass... or he is the one feeding your sorry ass...

Whether he kills you... whether you kill him... whether you both die of exhaustion...

This is my mood all day, err' day.

Las' las' you all will be all right.
