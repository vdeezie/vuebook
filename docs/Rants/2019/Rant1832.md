Simple people who are easily satisfied with more money in the account do not know how lucky they are.

Some of us are fighting inner demons that money can never satisfy. 

We are searching for meaning to everything that exists, every emotion... 

We are soul wanderers, and money still hasn't been able to define us.

I wish it did. I wish I could just buy a yacht and be happy.

I envy people who just want to make more money and be happy.

I have tried to be that person. I'm a bad actor.

They may never really understand us. 

We may never really understand us.

But whatever we are searching for is valid.
.

I wish you the best, artists and soul wanderers...

May you find what you seek.
