See ehn, be anything in this world, but please don’t be a “follower” (in that subservient Nigerian context). It is far more dignifying to be dead.

I know we were brought up in peculiar circumstances that required us not to ask too many questions: 

“Just listen” our parents will say 
“Just follow”, your pastor/imam would say 
“Just obey” your teacher used to say 
“Don’t argue” elders say.

My mother, in her primary school days, was taught by one of the most idiotic teachers in the world who told her that the plural of Ox is “Oxes”.

But my mum had read the right answer in her older brother’s book and would always write “Oxen” in her notebook.

She was flogged, her ears pulled, yet my stubborn mother (then barely 10) would insist she was right and tell the teacher, “you are wrong”.

The teacher got so frustrated that she finally dragged my mother to the headmistress' office. After the case was presented, the shock on the headmistress could electrocute someone. The shock was, of course, for the olodo teacher.

But this was what the headmistress did that was so wrong and typical in a subservient society like ours:
She told my mother to step out of her office, she corrected the foolish teacher privately, called my mother back and flogged her (my mum) for “disobedience” in front of the teacher, then gagged on the fact that she was, after all, correct.

(So why did you flog her, you dumb fuck?! )

My 10 year old mother was flogged for not following the wrong instruction of a daft teacher.

Followership is as much a responsibility as leadership, it would require you apply your brain. Don’t follow like a cow that is being led to an abattoir.

This is why we need to stop bringing up our children in the “Nigerian church”, it kills their intuition, slaughters their imagination, roasts their brains to a crisp buns.

So please ehn, don’t try to justify an old man’s memory flaw. He is old. That cannot be a bad thing. Let nature play its course. (Lord knows I can’t even remember where I dropped my hairpin since last night. Hian!). 

Don’t play the politics of the mind. You need a lot of money to get away with stupidity, and that is why ANY politician in Nigeria will be invited to a meeting with Nigerians and we still find it an honour, a privilege to have them amongst us. We will tweet about it, take selfies with him/her, talk about it cheerily on social media and FORGET so conveniently that he is sitting on top N300million or more of Nigerian money for being a governor or a representative of any state capacity. 

Money, even the ones forever beyond our reach, excites us. 

We forgive, our churches teach us so. 
We don’t ask too many questions, our elders tell us so
We don’t question “authority”, our parents say so.

We are followers- desperate, hungry, with faith so big and blind it frightens even Christ.

But I was going somewhere…

Like I believe Abati and Okupe and Omokri are the worst media representation for any kind of authority, how much more a sitting President; I do believe Buhari’s followers are way too “Neanderthalic” in their faith and pursuit for a future from a past long forgotten.

Follow with class. Let your MIND, not your heart, be involved. Join in healthy conversations. Laugh more (trust me, you'll need it with this candidate of yours). And think deeply of all the personal/social losses you're making for someone who knows you not and/or may never be able to repay you...that way, you'll take a chill pill and go watch "Orange is the New Black".

What season are they on, by the way? *sipping ginger tea*
