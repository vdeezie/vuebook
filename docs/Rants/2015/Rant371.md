In celebratory mood, we went for food, wine and movies yesterday.

It only made sense that we’d watch the “highest grossing movie of all time in Nigerian cinema” (or is that not how it was said?)- '30 Days in Atlanta' featuring AY, Ramsey Noah, Vivica Fox and Lynn Whitfield.

I didn’t want to really, but I wasn’t in the mood for that short man, Kevin Hart, prancing around like a roach and talking like an 8 year old girl all over the screen- that was the only other offer available at that hour, so I agreed to watch “30 Days in Atlanta”.

Let’s just say, we almost didn’t survive it. But it was just us- everybody else was having a good time, laughing and clapping to our astonishment.

“THIS right here, says a lot about the quality of our intellect and discernment,” he said.

'30 days in Atlanta' is torture. Nobody can convince me otherwise. Was there even a script or a director in this movie? If there were, then they need to be shot- right in their balls. 

What a mess.

It was so bad that at 11.15pm when we got out of the cinema, we were so cranky we almost went in for another movie to get rid of the terrible after-taste of 30 Days…

“God! That almost ruined our evening. Do a review of that movie please and save us all from this mediocrity…”

But then he added: “No, on second thoughts, that junk don’t deserve a review.”

I agree.

Uuugh!
