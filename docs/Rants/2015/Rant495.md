JayZ is not the best rapper

I believe Nas is better. But see where he sits on a scale of importance.

Look at P.Diddy and his rap skills like a 10 year old trying to ask a girl out for the first time. But he is one of the most successful; outdoing himself every year. 

Wendy Williams is trashy, biased; frankly time-wasting. But she is the new queen of talk.

Rihanna has a croaky voice.

Oprah is not the ideal beauty for TV. And it sure feels like OWN could do with some new ideas.

Mo Abudu is not TV's best host.

Understand how life works- talent is a miniscule part of success.

So tiny that, at the very end, the colours of life and all its frills will overwhelm whatever is left of talent's pride. Many successes will almost ride on gloriously without it.

It's unfair to the "talented", but it's the truth. 

If you will not understand this simple knowledge, you will remain a bitter tradesman in the business of life. 

Stop hurting yourself. 

Understand the principles. Keep your talent aside; stop masturbating. We know you are good. But you need some money. You need some of the luxury the "untalented" enjoy.

Wherever you are at this moment is as far your talent may ever be able to take you. 

What next? 

Strategise. 

Strategise. 

Strategise. 

Talent that will not teach you how to make money is no talent at all.

It's a burden. You are burdened.

Good night.
