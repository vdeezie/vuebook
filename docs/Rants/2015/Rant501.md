Extremist feminist.
Confused feminist.
Angry feminist.
Burnt feminist.
Lonely feminist.
Bitter feminist.

Labelling and/or bashing feminism is such a cool sport.

Awww.

Human beings can have all these emotions without being feminists, you know.

Do you go about saying…

Lonely architect or extremist vulcanizer?

When an unfortunate incident like rape happens, does the headline scream:
“Heterosexual male rapes heterosexual female”?

But when a homosexual rapes, we do know that daft headlines like this will suffice in Nigeria:
“Homosexual man rapes boy.”

It is only when you want to discriminate against a group of persons, you begin to come up with idiotic adjectives.

Some of these fools have jobs they haven’t yet finished. Articles they couldn’t get their brains to write, but they are on Twitter talking about feminism- the only topic that makes everyone feel like they’ve got yarns.

The deal is to keep you, feminist, timid and afraid. 

You know, when what-you-are is described with terms that are unflattering, you shrink to a bean size and remain quiet. You even deny what you are because, jeez, these terms are not what you wish to be called.

It’s bait. Don’t fall for it.

You are a Feminist. 

Period.

One who believes in equality of both sexes.

You do not have to be smart feminist, strong feminist, cool feminist, hot feminist.

Those terms, even when they come with endearing adjectives, are still as silly.

You. Are. A. Feminist.

That is enough. 

Any other thing is patronizing (and you do not want to be patronized, trust me. It is the lowest of all lows).

Don’t let adjectives from people flawed from top to bottom ever make you cower.
