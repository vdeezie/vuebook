Employee privileges are arrogant and outrageous stances that beg for empathy when really what should be required are handcuffs and huge compensations.

Employee A is a Christian. Manager at a company. She insists the entire workers pray for one hour before start of work every morning. She has a neat bible on her table. Reminds everyone she is married and happy with beautiful children.

When the business swells, it spills over to another side of town- a new branch is about to be launched to contain the excess demands which are largely acquired by the CEO. 

But manager isn’t showing as much enthusiasm as she should. This is the start of new greatness for the company, how come manager isn’t too happy?

Suspicion leads CEO to manager’s official laptop; with the help of an app that allows him source old and/or deleted emails and messages; he discovers manager is running a parallel business with her husband. She has cornered 80% of his clients. Sweet-talked clients with cheaper rates. And is even poaching members of staff from his company! 
CEO discovers manager’s letterhead papers, business cards and even website!

She was sacked with little drama. The only drama that ensued was created by manager herself…perhaps out of shame of being caught, she starts to curse the person who “sold her out”.

Her only major worry was that she was caught. 

She goes to town with the chant... “That CEO is a useless man with poor working conditions.”

A bible reading, chorus singing, hallelujah shouting, tongue proclaiming devil.

But she is an employee, and she has privileges that allow her to speak ill of an ex-boss.

Employee B claims he is sick, needs heart surgery, heads to Afghanistan for operation. Comes back, can barely work or walk, begs for leave, begs for time to recuperate. He claims he is permanently in the hospital, doctors are scared for his life, mother is crying, heart is weak, life is moving slowly, he can barely breathe, barely eat, barely barely…

Corporate empathy allows supervisor to plead for full salary for this employee. So he collects full salary every month even without coming to the office or working for months.

But they are all lies.

Employee isn’t sick. No heart surgery. No heart nothing. He is as fit as a monkey jumping trees.

But he figured a way he could pretend to be sick, take advantage of a kind boss and keep a fulltime job at another company, which allows him to get paid by two companies every month- the company that believes he is sick, and the company he works for.

When asked about this criminal act, he says, “that office is to tough jare. What is it? Person cannot make money by the side again?”
*** 
Employee C covers events. When the pictures come in, he swears he did not see Genevieve Nnaji on the red carpet, and places his finger to heaven claiming Jim Iyke did not come to the event.

But employer sees the same event on another site and finds that even the governor attended the event.

Curiosity leads him to the bottom of this story. Employer finds out that Employee C covers events, sends celebrity pictures to a certain website…and then dumps the bottom-pot of his photography on his (employer’s) site.

When Employee C is sacked, he goes to town to call employer a bitch (if it is a woman) or a wicked man (if male).

In Nigeria, there are more terrible employees than there are employers.

So when employers tweak employment contracts to suit the changing times of deception and mischief…contracts that protect their interests fully…

They are labelled sadists; anti-love, anti-help-me-grow, anti-make-me-progress, anti-share-dat-money; anti-is-it-wrong-to-succeed-under-your-company.

These employees will find their kind who will carry this ignorant gospel like a pity-party to the disco.

If you have not run a business in this country, just keep quiet and do your job. And eat mind-your-business everyday for lunch.

I have seen things (tufia kwa!).  

And I want to applaud every employer of labour in Nigeria.

You are the real MVPs.
