Hahahahaha!!!

Nigeria!

A young lady has been jailed for 266 years for stealing N8 million.

No, she didn't steal with a gun; she didn't threaten anyone's life, nobody was injured or killed. 

It wasn't a ransom for kidnap.

She just decided, foolishly, to walk away with corporate funds in her care and never show up at work again. 

And some Nigerian judge gave her the kind of judgment cold murderers and serial rapists and killers abroad have not had the privilege to enjoy.

266 years in a country where corruption is king.

Hahahaha! 

Her whole life is wasted because of N8million.

All I can think of is: how will that judge sleep at night? 

Biko, spare me every righteous opinion. I will not judge the thief more than she has been terribly judged. 

Where is the option of or hope for rehabilitation? 

Is prison time not meant to repair offenders, especially financial delinquents?

We negotiate with kidnappers, raise funds for their criminal businesses on social media; police parade them for a few hours, circulate the pictures online without any follow up to ensure this wasn't all a set-up to con the public. 

But we send N8million thieves to 266 years.

What a drunken nation of the cheapest wooziest crapiest brand of alcoholics!
