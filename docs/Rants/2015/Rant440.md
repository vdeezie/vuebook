There are many young men roaming the streets of Festac.

They wake up. Sit on a stool. And do nothing. All day.

Squatting in their father's homes with too many other siblings. Homes won in 1977 with N3.00 or something inconceivable at this present day.

They fight their mothers. Argue with their fathers. Loud arguments that shake the foundation of their homes. 

Sometimes, through dark curtains you can see someone wielding a knife.

Their siblings deny their existence. Lie to their friends. The vagabond is a house boy. Not their flesh and blood.

Some try to jump down three storey buildings to either die or get attention. 

As I head out, I'll find one in boxers, looking into the morning like an unfamiliar puzzle.

It seems to me that half the time of my life, I am living in this town with the most clueless men.

They are not mechanics and they are not bankers.

They just exist. Doing nothing. 

One answer could be that they are clueless of what to do with their lives. And as a bobo in the metropolis, if he's gonna work at all,  it's got to be golden.

So, I will not forgive madam Orekoya for giving anyone any ideas on how to make fast money. 

Collating money for criminals on social media is enough offence for anyone to be questioned, doubted and locked up.

Everything looked suspicious. The story incomplete. 

Just because someone is now paraded with a wound to her eye doesn't erase the questions we asked. 

We just sympathise and walk away. Praise da Lord and go back to our businesses. If some of us did not question this madness, you'd be driving your children to work and someone would jump out from nowhere without an inkling to your financial status, grab your kids and start WALKING away, brandishing a toy pistol.

They acted very selfishly. 

You do not save three children and put millions in danger.

Amuwo odofin is safe. The jobless men are still clueless. 

Let it remain that way.

Don't put ideas into their heads. 

So many times, Punch reports men who sell their children for paltry sums.

We find children in garbage bins.

Are these too not perpetuated by parents?

Was it not Mckenzie that killed her children because they were standing in the way of her spending time with her boyfriend?

Did we not see the video of a woman who deliberately pushed her toddler over the bridge in some dark American city, fortunately caught on tape? 

C&I is not a series featuring the Nigerian Police. These are real life crime events.

Our desperations are real. It is our kindness that is most likely fictitious. 

So quit trying to make us feel like we should be sorry for questioning this madness that was birth by the Orekoyas.
