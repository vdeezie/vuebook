Patriarchy is deaf.

I have, in the last seven years, been responsible for all my bills.

Children's school fees, rent, utility bills,  mum's monthly upkeep, children's daily constant needs, leisure, food, ... everything.

I pay everything to the socks on my children's feet.

I pay on time. I don't ask no one for money.

Yet Patriarchy wont listen; it wants to share its own clich√© story of needy women. And fails to recognise women like me, who pick all the bills, exist in society.

Patriarchy pretends to be upset with women who daily require a man's support; and is threatened by the rest of us who run lives, careers and businesses successfully.

You will soon run mad, patriarchy. 

If you are, in 2015, stuck with a woman who needs you to take care of the weave on her hair, then it is the life you chose.

Stop acting like you don't find such needy women a turn on.

You do.

You like the fact that you can flip your leather wallet out of your back pocket and sort out trifling issues like smirnoff ice and lipstick, with a big hug as reward. And for sex, a bottle of perfume will do.

You love it, patriarchy. You sick fuck.

So when I speak, shut up.

There's a new society and it contradicts everything you are or endorse.

We present you a choice, patriarchy. But we know you are comfortable where you are, arguing senselessly over your privileges 
- some as ridiculous as who gets to microwave the plate of beans.

I am here to remind you that women will no longer be defined by the poor choices you make.

And I dislike you greatly, patriarchy.
