My mother is a walking Nollywood script, there’s always one awkward experience she encounters every day.

So today, I took a minute off work to pay her and the girls a visit. After rice and chicken, she told me she caught one of her neighbours sobbing on the balcony a night before.

So why was a grown woman sobbing on the balcony?

“She is not married,” my mother said, “and she had to sell her SUV so that men will not see her as married or unapproachable. That way she can get a lift sometimes whilst walking down the street. And anything can happen from there.”

(Yes, anything like a rope around her neck. Raped and choked.) *smh*

My worry is not even the woman; people have the weirdest needs; they make the most bizarre judgements. I have lost the ability to be shocked by anything.

My worry was for my mum. She actually sounded like this shit makes any sense. 

“What’s that look on your face?” I questioned her sudden droopy eyes and the sad sigh that fell heavy on her shoulder.

“Are you, by any chance, feeling sorry for a woman who has a good job, an apartment of her own; had an SUV and has the world in her palms?" I asked, slightly irritated. "Are you feeling sorry for her because she is daft enough to sell her car to find a man OR you feel sorry she would even think that an option?” 

“No oh… Isi, not every woman is as strong as you,” my mum said.

“I am NOT strong, mummy. But I am not weak either. Your neighbour is ridiculous.”

How can a woman sell her SUV because she needs to get a man? Who are these women?

*sighs*
