In Nigeria there’s no means to an(y) end. What you do at this moment is what you live for- there’s no future, no higher value to an act than the act itself.

Your day job is meant to feed you. It is not the ticket to greatness.

Your participation in church is so that you can find a place to show off your new shoes and hairdo. It is not a means to becoming a better road user or a more rational being.

Your need to be with someone is its own benefit- to be with someone. Period. For the average lover, it is not a partnership that is going anywhere beyond an extensive chat after sex, and the feeling of warmth.

We are basic. -Because we are a hand-to-mouth society. And it is almost impossible to justify anything that acts outside a certain pattern or rule.

In my children’s school, I noticed the only offices with A/C…the only offices that are tiled and crisp are the admin offices.

I pay exorbitant fees just so the school can continue to upgrade their admin offices. You walk in and you’d think you walked into a new generation bank.

But take a walk to the classes; my older daughter’s class, for one, looks like an indomie pack with a hole in it to serve as a window. It is hot, stuffy, damp, dingy. When I pick up my girls after school, I can see them almost panting for air!

We went to the admin office last week to collect receipts of payment, and before we stepped out of the chic room, my older daughter blurted:

“They are here enjoying all the A/C, while we suffer the heat in class.”

My daughter hardly even sounds so scornful. None of them inherited my contempt for life’s ridiculous circus. It was a moment that killed me to hear her sound that way. 

They have wronged her and all the other students.

There have been times the standing fan in the classes would break down and it’d take weeks for admin to respond. 

I have talked about their school tie on FB before- an expensive piece of rag, and the audacity of the school to punish any student not wearing one… when in actual fact that rag did not last more than a week before tearing apart. Some parents have to tie the shit around their children’s neck like goats. 

I have complained. I have ranted. I have argued. 

But I am the quarrelsome parent, the one blacklisted, the one who needs to be careful so they don’t transfer their cynicism to my kids.

Money in our pocket, food in our mouth is the ultimate goal of the Nigerian.

Private schools are not so your kids are trained to become confident leaders; the money you pay is the means that takes them (the owners of the institution and their immediate family) to the end of personal luxury and effects. Nothing more; while average education continues.

So when you tell someone, ‘this is not what I want’

They tell you, ‘how much is it worth to give it up though?’

-Because money is not a means to an end. It is the end, the goal. The raw achievement.

And you dare not walk away from it.

And I dare not continue to complain about my kids receiving education in a dingy classroom, when what I pay can afford to get them to study in a class with sliding boards, laptops, A/C and inverter when power is gone, and a (educational) movie on a 72” flat screen TV during breaks.
