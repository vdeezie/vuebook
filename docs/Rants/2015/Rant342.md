I just saw one of Ambode’s campaign slogans: “Cheap, qualitative food is the right of every Lagosian”

This is, by far, the saddest reality of our predicament.

The Nigerian entity is fighting for “qualitative” food. People are literally hungry in Nigeria. 

That’s where we are in our country- “qualitative” food for people and their children to eat.

That is something we need a Governor to do for us. That is part of his campaign agenda- "qualitative food".

He will need 4 years to help put stew on our rice; then another 4 years to put chicken in the stew.

I don't know which is more annoying- the fact that we are starving as a nation OR that adjective: “Qualitative”.

Sometimes I just want to sit and cry.

Qualitative? Food?

Some kids in high school somewhere in the West are trying to jet to Saturn to study the ring system and how humans can benefit from science, we are still here talking about basic needs:

“I will provide electricity” “I will provide clean water” “I will do your roads…”
“I will provide QUALITATIVE food” 

Someone is going to stand on a rostrum and say:

“In 2015, I shall provide you QUALITATIVE food!”

And everyone from Mushin to Oshodi to Amuwo Odofin to Ikotun to Makoko will scream: AMEN!!!

And then they will proceed to share salt and rice and live fowl.

Qualitative food.

I don't feel Nigerian at all.

I hate this country so badly.
