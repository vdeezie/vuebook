This society will ruin us.

Last weekend, out and about, I had my cup of Kiwi ice-cream, and I needed to pee.

I handed the cup to my partner for a minute.

Less than 15 seconds, a couple- boy and girl, walked by, and the girl smirked…

“See as bobo hold ice cream for woman as if say im life depend on am. Love don shack am die.”

A whisper too loud and inappropriate.

When he told me, I shook my head.

Women, sometimes, y’all deserve the tough deal you get in your relationships. You still don’t understand the basics of human bonding.

Why should holding a woman’s cup of Kiwi ever be an issue in 2015, dear Nigerians?

Do you want to inherit your mothers' loveless life?

So the next time I needed him to hold my bag for just one minute, he flinched for a second.

I saw it. And it made me sad.

Of course, he carried the bag but not after a deep sigh.

Whatever that meant.

It is just a bag. It is just a bloody cup of ice cream. It is just a kiss at the mall.

Why will we not let our men be human beings with souls?

Why won’t we let them love us without the unsolicited remarks and judgments that carry out quick emasculation?

Let them love us, biko.

Let them hold shopping bags; let them kiss us on the lips every minute they have the chance to see how amazing this feels. This!

Let them sing with croaky voices into our ears; let them sit on the grass and stroke our hair; let them hold our heels when we need a quick change to flats half way into an outing; let them feed us chips in a fancy restaurant, give us a massage as we wait at the airport for our flight.

Let them love us.

If you don’t want, me I want.

Save your fucking judgments.

Stop questioning a relationship without cooking pots and dirty laundry. Let us feed off high-end restaurants for the rest of our lives if we want.

Is it your money?

We want men, not bullies.

Stop asking for real men…and then turn around to quibble about a guy doing the love/romantic stuff.
