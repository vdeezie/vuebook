I don't do "extended family" at all.

I don't share in their joys, I don't carry their burdens.

Too much pretention in the way they meddle in your business. People who don't even know the names of your children, trying to give advice the minute they believe you can become "something".

So you are paying your dad a visit, for instance... because you love your dad.

Then you meet his cousin- a mother's sister's last born delivered 55 years ago, or so.

He has some advice on how you can reconcile with your ex-husband. 

You tell him to save the advice for his own children- one of them dragged by the hair out of a matrimonial home as wretched as a wet empty carton in the hands of an abusive useless man/husband. Her clothes, like confetti all over the street. Neighbours begging for mercy. 

He had had enough. This wife of his has got to learn to stay up when he goes drinking, so she can open the door when he gets back. (Don't ask me about spare keys and shit. Don't ask me about anything when it comes to how other people run their, frankly, pathetic homes).

I can't let that kind of opportunity go to waste. I have to look into your eyes and tell you: "your shit stinks worse. Wipe from front to back."

But this post is not about worn uncles who speak from both sides of their mouths. 

I want to talk about 23 year old cousins who are out of order; female, no ambition, no plans, proud for no reason, becoming their mothers, doing absolutely nothing with their lives, flinging knives at their uncles.

What do you do?

My mum had a solution in mind- beat the folly outta her hair.

Which I endorse. I mean, you must be mad flinging knives at people!

But I have a plan: I will take her out. To the Island. We will spend the day together. Have breakfast at some fancy bistro, lunch at a hotel, spend some time at the movies, go shopping, then dinner. Hand her an envelope with some money, give her some useful advice:

"There is a different world out here; a better dream away from the slum you and your mother have subjected yourselves to. You can be different. You can be better than your upbringing. You can live above the expectations of others. What are your ambitions? Start pursuing them. Don't do this to yourself. Don't become exactly what you truly despise."

And so on...blah blah.

Then I shall set her off to her home. Back to a world where knives are better tools of communication. 

If she has any sense, she'd think about the possibilities of having a better life.

But people don't think. They just brag their way through every problem.

But my job will be done. For life.

I'll be back to my own home, taking care of my own children.
