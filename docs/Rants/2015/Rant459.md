There’s an awkward habit of silence when the subject is on sex and the partners you’ve been with.

We know what bloggers did to sugabelly for being honest enough to tell what her body count was. That term in itself is sexist; if you can’t use it for a man then don’t use it for a woman.

Elnathan, for instance, jokes about prostituting as a side hustle, yet no blog has picked up on those tweets yet.

It’s the response he gives anytime the trite question on how he survives as a fulltime writer comes up.

They don’t care if a man is fucking for leisure or money or love. 

But since homosexuality is illegal in Nigeria, we would assume men are fucking women- but only the women, in the fucking business, are to blame

If Elnathan was a woman, he’d be the trending topic. Until he is shamed into silence.

Things like that annoy me. 

-Because patriarchy.

It is not the flagrant ambition of patriarchy that upsets me; it is the subtle pseudo-cerebral inclusions that irk me.

I wouldn’t be so upset if a woman is denied a position of authority as I would be if she occupied that position and would have to deal with colleagues address her as “dear”; not as an endearing method of friendship, but suggesting she is a bit inappropriate for the position… because she is a woman. If not for the extra degree she acquired in London, this post should be kept for a man.

Something like that.

The subject of sex and the men you’ve been with is that touchy subject we let lie low.

And that’s why, really, I talk about everything. You have to first get over the shame that society compels you to bear as a woman before you can truly enjoy being a human being- not male, not female, just human.

One chick has the résumé of a whore in a certain industry. These men are friends with her but the gist persists.

How good a fuck she is.

If I have heard it- me, sitting outside the threadbare cliques that exist… uncommitted and uninterested in everything that happens in that environment, then you can imagine how well travelled the gist is.

I should be the last person to hear it, I don’t do anything with these people.

I don’t know if it is true. I don’t care.

Babe can do whatever she likes. She’s an adult.

What worries me, however, is…

Is she aware this tale is being told? And is it actually TRUE?

I don’t know about anyone else, I would HATE to get “credit” for a fuck that never happened.

That shit annoys me to no end. 

And men lie about these things. Maybe women too. I don’t know.

Claim your fuck, but ensure you do not have a fuck credited to you that was invented during beer parlour banter by people you've never set your eyes on.

Now, I am beginning to doubt the authenticity of that tale…as it is, men say these lies because they know women do not bother to clarify on sex issues. 

It shames them instantly and they just wish for it to die naturally. The reason women want to remain perpetual virgins even after a trail of colourful sex life.

I’m sorry, I don’t agree. Let us all own our fucks and let the devil remain a liar. 

I am not a baby, ehn? And I am not suffering from amnesia. 

If you lie that we have been together, especially in that raggedy industry (with this particular chick, I now suspect any woman can be a victim of these fabricated clandestine tales).

If you LIE that you have been with me, and I hear…

Just know that you are finished.
