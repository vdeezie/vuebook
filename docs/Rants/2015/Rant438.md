So…

We all know the story of Fashion Police:

Guilana Rancic, as ignorant as can be, thought the locs on Zendaya Coleman was shrubs of marijuana and said that much when she criticised the girl’s appearance on the red carpet.

It was a faux pas – not Zendaya’s hair, but Guilana’s comments.

And as expected, the world came for her (Guiliana) bag of bones. Twitter beat her to a pulp.

That was, of course, in order with the culture of social media…

But what was not alright was Kelly Osbourne’s reaction.

Kelly and Rancic are friends, beyond Fashion Police, they show respect and support for their personal/career growths. 

So when Rancic made that terrible blunder, in the nooks of hypocrisy, Osbourne had promised her that they would go through the ordeal together.

As true friends should.

But because women have such overwhelming depth of love and hate; dark wells of resentment and distrust…

Kelly decided to go against this oh-so warm promise and came out instead to disassociate herself from Rancic- in public!
 
She made a fanfare about it too – did her own cool press release, tweeted about “liars and careless rants” (obviously referring to Rancic), took some new pictures too in the wake of her friend’s media flak… and got trending for a while.

Only for a while.

-Because, really, you cannot sustain your so-called cause on hate alone.

I watched The Osbourne’s biopic a long time ago- a family with tough issues, hard drugs, afflictions and suicidal tendencies.

Over the years, Fashion Police has shown us a good side of Kelly Osbourne- as an intelligent young woman, and beyond the hard issues her family suffers and and her own personal drudgery, she is “cool people” and can keep a career in fashion journalism.

Rancic is instrumental in some ways to Osbourne’s fashion reportage. Friendship blossomed.

Now betrayal in the most idiotic way. Hilarious, really.

So you separate yourself from your friend during a fall.

Dumb fuck, don’t you know these things last only for a minute or two? Something else will happen- people will die in Africa; some will get burned in South Africa, cops will shoot black men jogging away in America...

Life. Goes. On.

And that little issue your friend had will become as insignificant in the eye of the storm of life as a flake of snow evaporating. 

Too engrossed with making Rancic look bad, Osbourne couldn’t see she was hurting her own career, killing a piece of her own future. (yes, she resigned... so did Charlie Sheen in "two and a half men"... we know the drill, abeg)

Guiliana has picked up her shattered bones on the streets of twitter, and has announced Fashion Police will be back this September (in time for the Emmys’)…

And Osbourne will be watching the Emmys’ from home this time, with a pack of popcorn, gaining back all her weight.

And the morale of the story is...

Bitch, your self importance and entitlements are made from the remnants of Orubebe Comedy Show.
