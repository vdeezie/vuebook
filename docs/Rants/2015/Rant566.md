The most dangerous unit/element of society is Family.

Not religion. Not culture.

Family shrouds murderers, rapists, paedophiles, thieves, delinquents, miscreants.

Family accepts crooks, sympathizes with the lazy man, denies right to justice.

Families are built on secrets. Defending ignoble exploits.

Family internalizes pain as much as it celebrates pleasure.

Family confidences are half the time dirty, outrageous, inexcusable filth. 

Family sets one foot out and corrupts everything around, including- yes, religion and culture.

Family is proud, selfish, corrupt, deluded, gullible.

Family is the one unit we can trust to guard our vile tendencies.

There’s a mother who wishes away her daughter’s sexual assault because if she pretends it didn’t happen, and keeps smiling at the neighbour who did it… then it didn’t happen.

There’s a father who did not report his son’s participation in the robbery attack that killed six people in the neighbourhood.

There’s an aunt who is feeding a grown ass nephew who has no zeal to get a job.

Nothing condones mediocrity and downright criminality like good ol’ Family.
