It is easy to take friendship for granted. So easy.

And I don’t want to ever get used to this and believe I am entitled to it.

I am entitled to nothing.

Yet I have been blessed with the best friends any woman can ask for!

They show up. They always show up! When I hurt, when I am pained, when I want to go out for a drink, when I need to talk, when I need to get mad, when I succeed, when i change my mind…

They understand. They just show up to support me, give me the voice I need, the power of numbers.

Their love is unrelenting.

They have seen all shades of Joy, yet they remain, loving me relentlessly

They support me like I am special.

I don’t think I am. This wave I am on, is not me, it’s the people who stay so damn loyal to me.

I love you girls so much. I choose you over life. I choose you over everything.

I choose the way you love me.

They are the busiest women I know, working 9-5 and running very demanding businesses, still they make me a priority.

Thank you- Funke Phillips, Funmi Akinsola, Yemisi Sawyerr, Bunmi Cynthia Adeleye, Prisca Egbukuchi

Thank you for making this life a beautiful one.

I hope I can reciprocate all this love you show me. I love you so much y'all!
