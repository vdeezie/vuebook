That day you realise "Feminism" is a cause for women to respect other women.

That day you realise your ambition for equal rights is actually a fight for women to appreciate the weaknesses of other women.

That day you discover you are fighting your own kind. A gender, apple cursed.

Women with no value. Filled with tingly bitter taste of unending strife.

Married to patriarchy. 

Threadbare wrappers, slapping their thighs, hair invoked by withcraft, having a good laugh at other women with men who once told them their vagina must taste like beer.

Prostitution defined by friendship. On a troll to the next clich√©; hungry for lunch. For wine. For relevance. For anything. 

A sense of fulfilment to see another woman deprived.

Feminism is a war against other women.

Men are mere spectators.

That day you make this discovery, is the day you find peace.
