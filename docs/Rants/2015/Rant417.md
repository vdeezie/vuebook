Abeg! There’s way too much pride in our humility.

I remember making a trip with a friend sometime back and whenever we met someone he considered beneath him, he was effusive with his greetings and titles…

Butlers, plumbers, mechanics, doormen…all received lavish “hello sirs… Yes sirs… Of course sirs… Thank you sirs”

It was ridiculous; even the men were embarrassed by this gushing and pretentious regard.

I told him to stop. Because it was obvious mockery. It was clear his “kindness” was a means of making up for his poor judgment of what he thought they were.

I detested that.

I have seen him with men of his own calibre or people he truly regarded with certain qualities, and he was “normal”.

So yes, stop it.

These people (mechanics and waiters etc) are not fools. THEY KNOW these things and they detest it too.

Besides, there’s absolutely nothing wrong in being a butler, so why do we think we have to “make up” for their (poor? You think? You’z wrong!) choices by being effusively nice- as if we pity them? 

They hate and love their jobs just like we all do.

Treat them like you would treat anybody else. With simple respect. Don’t gush over them and don’t treat them disdainfully or have special ways of handling their issues.

Just be “normal”.

Like when you see a morbidly obese person walk into a restaurant; don’t stare in pity or in shock or in kind admiration.

Suck in your judgments and just look at the person, like you would anybody else.

No distinctions abeg.

Not everybody is going to be a Managing Director; someone is going to have to clean the office and serve the tea and run the errands- and that’s just fine!

If you don’t want to be that person, that's fine too. Someone will; and it doesn’t make them different.

It is because we look down on these "other jobs" that we think we have to treat them a little "nicer".
