Let me tell you about the best Coca-Cola Ad I ever saw

It was along Apongbon bridge, as I recall. I was still doing the excruciating journey from Mainland to Island on a 9-5 job at the time. I got a brand new car, a Honda City- small reward for my agonising daily trip.

So there I was in my car, the sun had licked the A/C dry and I was left sore and irritated. Traffic was, as usual, felonious. 

I looked up, and I saw it. A billboard with the caption:

“Can you feel the heat?”

It was an Ad for a new energy drink, with a flaming silhouette of a woman on a depressing black background beside a can sample of the drink.

Can you feel the heat?! Some Ad company thought this a wise question to ask Lagosians burning in traffic and believe this would make their product endearing?!?! 

Yes damn it! I feel the heat! I hate it!!! Now pass me a bottle of ice-cold Coca-Cola! Uuugh!!!

Before this experience, I can say that I have had Coke only 4 times in my adult life. 

But looking at that billboard at that moment, with the sun overpowering my A/C and the traffic making me lose my mind, I knew the only solution to this dumb question from this energy drink people would be an ice-cold Coca-Cola. 

And so I started a tradition of buying Coca-Cola every time I drove through that route to meet that billboard still asking me that crazy question! So piercing this question of heat that I would literally throw my jacket to the back seat and whistle to a trader to bring me a cold bottle of Coke- FAST! Something I never would have thought of buying if that energy drink (can’t even remember the product name) didn’t ask such a silly question that made me desire something of opposite extremes.

I think I took an extra 11 Coca-Cola bottles in my life just because of that ill-conceived Ad from a ‘competition’.

How, in heaven’s soothing clouds, do you ask a Nigerian living in a tropical clime if s/he can feel the heat? What kind of Ad campaign is that?!

We feel the heat everyday- in our homes, when the light goes off, under the scorching sun, in traffic, in the office. Heat stays with us; and half the time we want to get rid of it! Reminding us of this matter makes your Ad impression rather tactless.

I still cringe every time I remember that Ad.

The energy drink didn’t survive the heat apparently. It disappeared from the market after a year or so.

Ok, so I’m supposed to follow this narrative with a Nigerian prayer, something like:

“This year, your competition will advertise your market for you…”

But that’s just not the kind of thing I’d ever say.

So, Happy New Year will do.

Start working off your butt at what you are good at. Hard work answers to the universe. And the universe answers back.

Between those lines is where success resides.

Best, always!
