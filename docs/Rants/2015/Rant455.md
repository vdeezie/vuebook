Of the one thousand and one daily thoughts in my head, more than 99% are deliberate methods to unlearning the big-headed monster-

Patriarchy.

Like Temidayo Ahanmisi said, “we are faced with a challenge of unlearning, rather than of ‘ignorance’”

Women do not know any better than the society that instructs them. Groomed by patriarchy, women become fine guardians of the system.

It is not the questioning; it is not ignorance; it is a process of unlearning all that we have learned.

Nollywood doesn’t know any better, and so the biggest celebratory success of the woman is when she is forgiven by a husband and brought back into matrimony to bear the ‘Mrs’ title and have many children. 

I am yet to watch ONE mainstream Nollywood plot that celebrates another kind of triumph for the female.

That is why a new born, yet to sprout its first tooth, is beseeched to “mature and have a beautiful home with a dozen children.”

Our greatest achievement remains on the dining table with a happy family and a lot of repressed desires and objectives. That is the true African woman- patient, long suffering, humble, quiet, prayerful, homely, able to make a pot of soup with her eyes closed.

Running your own business, footing daily bills, acquiring a skill and owning your own property or a yacht is yet to be seen as complete success, as breastfeeding a child whilst tending to the sexual needs of a husband who loves to “come home everyday” would ever be.

Awwwww. Patriarchy loves homely sweet quiet women. They are the best.

That is what Alibaba teaches you, and he gets 188 retweets and fawning comments on blogs, praising his amazing and rare “intelligence”. 

Black magic, with the magic nose, tells us a woman is not complete if she cannot cook; and our young girls push their ambitions to be pilots or scientists or architects down the toilet, to worry about cooking a perfect pot of Egusi soup- to satisfy, eventually, ONE man and four children.

We give up dreams that can change the world, and are coerced with fervent lecturing of how a woman’s place is first in the kitchen and then on a bed- legs wide open, orgasm flamboyant.

How did we even fall for this stunt in the first place?

How can a human being live only to end up in a home with a husband and children? And that is counted as virtuous!

How?

And if that escapes you, your best bet is to chase love- nothing else would count as an achievement until you catch love by the belt and live according to its demands.

We are unlearning.

I want to wake up to a new society where women are judged by real accomplishments.
And what “real” is would be determined by the individual.

Patriarchy has a script and a woman living away from that script is usually seen as unhappy, scorched, bitter. That is where the labels come from.

It is better to stay covered in matrimony without much accomplishments anywhere else, than forge on into exciting territories of business and livelihood.

We are unlearning.

The gift to  look at another woman and not judge her is a gift many women do not have.

I woke one day and decided not to take any advice from any woman. Ever again. 

Yes, women. I cannot remember any man throwing advice my way.

It is always women trying to curb you.

“Joy, don’t write like that.”
“Joy, can you afford that?”
“Joy, are you sure that is the correct price? Or maybe you are mistaken, do you want to calculate it again?”
“Joy, see ehn, me and yakata are not friends anymore…”

Hush it already, you heap of dirty dungarees! How empty-headed can you be? Brains getting smaller, midriffs getting wider.

You know nothing.

Go and unlearn the education of patriarchy. Then come and question me on the bills I have to pay. Bills I have ALWAYS paid. Have I knocked on your door for once to request help? Oh you bloody "fairy godmothers".

Would it be better if I had to share my glory with a man? Pour all my gratitude in a cup and cry, "For all that I am, I thank my husband. If not for him, I am but a tiny piece of paper lost in the air..."

Or something just as gushing and flowery that would make your diseased patriarchal brain content.

There are very few cliques of women that are positive. Very few. You’d do well minding your business wholly, maybe you can catch a break from your own struggles.

Maybe. It is still questionable. Do you have a head that can process anything apart from scrutinizing the life of another woman? 

We are unlearning.

Save yourself. Save your daughters. 

Save your sons from a world where women constantly confuse them to be God... and in sadder situations, babies.
