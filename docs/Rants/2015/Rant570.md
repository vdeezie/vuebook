Nigerian women be like:

My husband raped me...dragged me by the hair down the stairs...forced me to drink Izal...buried my head in a toilet bowl...kicked me around like a ball...slashed my throat...and pushed me down a five storey building...

Now I am dead. What should I do?

Should I leave him?

***

Nigerian advisers be like:

Please don't rush out of your marriage. Even though you are dead, remember the scripture. Don't leave him. Just manage...for the sake of the children. 

Not even death should stop your love for him. 

Please rise from the morgue and go back home...and love your man.

PS: I don't belong in this society. Walahi.
