In recognition of world teachers’ day, I have this to say…

Nigerian teachers, stop raising our children like zombies!

Last week, I flipped through my younger daughter’s exercise books…

She got two out of five questions wrong in one classwork.

Why? I asked

My daughter replied: “My teacher wanted me to write it EXACTLY the way it was written in my notebook.”

I was furious.

Here is a smart little girl who interprets life in colours…

Why would you want to take that away from any child?

You see in grey, she sees in yellow.

Leave a child to be as exciting as her imagination will let her. Let her do a moonwalk over reds and purples and greens. Let her inteprete life as she sees it.

Let her be her own woman. An individual. Guide, but don't repress her genius. 

Her interpretations are fine; it is your system that is stifling.

Let children be taught how to find themselves.

I taya!
