A friend called very late last night. His words were troubling...

"I'm losing it, Joy. I'm losing it. I can't. I'm lost. I'm tired. Life makes death so appealing."

This is probably one of the most industrious persons I know. Full of life. Stubborn. Crazy. Kind. 

I allowed him kill himself over and over again. A knife stab in the chest. A bullet to the head. Poison down his throat. And when he was done with suicide, I asked him... "so if you die nah who am I going to trouble with all my narcissistic farts?"

He laughed, "Narcissistic farts. Stupid girl"

We talked about other things. School fees coming up Monday- the start of a new term, xenophobia in SA, Dstv N16,120 premium bouquet madness, the price of garri and the colour of ogogoro... random nothings that depressed us both yet comforted us.

He is a strong man. You need to see this dude move around his sphere of influence. A true leader. Spirited. Confident. 

He probably had a great day. Ran his affairs as he should. 

But when it was all done, there are people he can call on and cry to.

If he chooses the wrong people to cry to then his vulnerable moments will be used to bake bread for a lot of others to eat.

"Look at him acting like he is happy when he called last night crying."

Dumb and dumber.

Even in his hour of victory, a man like Buhari might still be terribly insecure.

Tinubu, the great machiavelli, might be frightened by the dark. 

Dangote might just be insecure about life. 

Genevieve Nnaji might win the best actress of the decade and still go home to stare into a cup of coffee, terrified of the future.

-Because we are human beings. 

We don't wear our flaws on our sleeves.  But we all share the same emotions - without expection.

Your fears and insecurities are valid. So are your bragging rights. 

The only problem might be the people you share them with.

It is a privilege to have someone who isn't a leech call you to share a part of their lives they don't share with the world.

It is a fucking privilege. 

You are fucked if you think it is the script you can use to define them; writing dirty posts, gathering hate comments.

To what end? That you can brag that... "He ain't the superhuman we thought him to be sef. See, he called me last night crying. He must be very lonely. His life must be very sad."

The only sad one is you.

But life is such a cool thing. You aren't allowed too much time to rejoice over someone else's misfortune. Your own life is always there to remind you of how ugly average looks like. Your own struggles,  your own mistakes staring at you like a lion about to end you.

That is solace.

For those afraid to show their vulnerabilities, remember Superman is the same person as Clark Kent.

Choose your confidante wisely.
