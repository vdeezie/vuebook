4 men who’ll make heaven (considering heaven is an award ceremony for cerebral crushes) 

Oris Aigbokhaevbolo – if his genius came with a price tag, it’ll be in the range of a £122,380 limited edition of Chateau Margaux.  

Nicholas Ibekwe - because a Nigerian journalist can be intelligent, principled, and with stubborn wit.

Kola Tubosun - A gentleman about his linguistic business with consistent effort and patient resolve

Onyeka Nwelue - the world is too big for everyone to wear the same colour. You cannot find Onyeka’s tone anywhere else in the world. A big heart too. He balances friendship from both ends quite well (I’m sure he doesn’t even know what I mean. LOL!)
