That Nigerians continue to reduce the importance of Feminism to the square space in their average apartments called kitchen is because that is all a woman is designed to be in the Patriarchy. 

We are talking equal rights, you are talking beans and agege bread. 

We are addressing social, political, cultural, economic issues... yet your questions and pessimism rest solely on...

"Who will fry plantain for me?"

Third world thinking in a third world situation. Why don't you help yourself before ignorance waylays you at a corner and chokes you to death?

I was on a TV show last night. The topic was on Feminism, the producer confessed to me this is the biggest show and highest response they've had since the show started.

Listeners were calling every millisecond, they had to block calls so we can at least address the issue on feminism. Facebook went gaga.

This pleases me. Whether you are for or against the movement, I am glad that even a security guard in Nigeria can call in to add his own voice to feminism.

For or against, as long as the gospel is preached. 

The "simplicity" of the Nigerian is a curse, I am sorry.

We don't care if she cooks your food with myrrh and presents it in a ribbon...

We don't care what women do in their marriages.

I have never advised any woman on marital issues. I don't care about you and your immediate "love" choices. Uugh. 

I care about women in more positions of power and influence. I care about women enjoying same privileges in corporate, political climes.

I care about things that affect more than a nuclear family.

We need to get our heads out of our own anus. There's living to be lived.

If you are hungry, pound your yam or let your wife pound it or let your muscular neighbour help out or exhume a dead body to do it...

Or buy poundo yam.

We don't care. 

Do whatever you like with food that you will shit out in another minute.

Stop reducing an entire movement to how sweeter jollof rice is to white rice.
