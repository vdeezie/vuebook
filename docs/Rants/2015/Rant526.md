They want us to approach feminism with "intellectual finesse"...

But someone shared her story of abuse in the hands of a husband, groomed by patriarchy to inflict pain.

The metal buckle of a belt as a weapon to humiliate and hurt.

Should we talk about that over a cup of tea and toast?

#Jokers.

Let me go and revel over another successful outing. 

#TheConversation Ibadan was brilliant. Everybody on point.

I'll be back to expound on the pretentious intelligence of the Nigerian pseudo bourgeois with a social media account.

Thanks to Bunmi Familoni for keeping it real, and trashing such idiotic intellectual hogwash people parade on social media.

Sophisticated feminism with long legs and blonde hair, crisp shirt and moccasin... 

Go and tell that to the girl in Iju who was  raped for refusing to date a bus driver.

I hope nobody is defining their ambitions around the opinions of social media twerkers.

If you are, you have my sympathies. 

Thanks to my headliners and all participants. 

Ibadan was great!
