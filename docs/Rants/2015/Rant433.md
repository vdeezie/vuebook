Because I’m so so lonely and I like attention, I’m going to share this…

Linda Ikeji called me this morning.

There are three sides to every story…

Their side. Your side. And the truth- in between all the embellishments.

I believe Linda. (Just as you believe APC deserves to win and PDP must call to congratulate. Simple. I just believe.)

It’s in her voice, it’s in the way she says, “Joy, this is Linda. I’ve been meaning to call you for ages. How are you?”

Aww. See? I finally get the attention I need. Hallelujah!

And then she adds, “Please if you have a minute, let me just tell you what happened.”

You see? Loneliness solved too.

Chei! Only me one?

See ehn, Linda is a nice person. A shrewd businesswoman, but a nice person.

I’m not.

So I’m going to tell y’all: It is WRONG to bully one person for something a thousand others are guilty of.

It is WRONG to send hate mails, rude and personal correspondence to one person for a “crime” committed by a thousand.

Did anyone send a mail to Chude Jideonwo of Ynaija? Why didn’t you carve that saucy letter to Chude nah, let him tell you how this shit is done with a response that will shorten your life span.

Or is it just a cool fancy to attack Linda… some sport of sort.

Of course, we can be bitter that she gets paid all that money; we can talk about it at lunch and scowl all day on how unfair the monopoly is… I have always stood with the fact that Linda’s monopoly needs to be broken, and I have written a post about it before.

That is business combat.

But what is business about sending cheap unprofessional mails to an individual, threats and abuses…and then you expect her to write you a love letter as a response?

If she said she found the article online, carried by a hundred other sites and decided to use it on her platform like everybody else, her crime would be the audacity to gather more comments than anyone else.

If that is the crime, then the gutter approach is in order.

Which makes you no better than what you think she is.

So you sue her for theft, and she sues you for defamation. Because she insists she got express permission to use that piece.

Like I said before, my own people picked that piece from the street like a fatherless child. But I know its father, so I gave the child icecream and sent it away.

Akoba Adaba Olorun ma je ka ri...

But it is a long story and not worth the golden hours of our lives, and like Aziza mentioned, this is zero Alexa-rating brouhaha.

But I just had to share oh! The amazing hianity of it all!

By the way, Linda's voice is like butter cake melting in your mouth.

Aww! See famzing!
