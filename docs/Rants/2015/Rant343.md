If the first conversation rests on, “You are beautiful”, then there’s a problem.

I wouldn’t know how to respond because “Beautiful” is unexceptional, boring, bland.

It is not a compliment; it died a flattering remark with Cleopatra; its remnants flowered Monroe’s era, but that’s about it.

Beauty counts for nothing these days. It means nothing. It is tossed around everywhere like cheap QUALITATIVE food (I'm sorry, I just had to do that LOL!) 

Have you been to well-designed offices in Lagos? Do you see the bevy of beauties at every turn? It’s common fancy.

Everything and everyone is beautiful. It is so mundane, so basic; it is unable to raise the dead.

Everybody’s wife and their concubines are beautiful. Every girlfriend is beautiful. The dick that makes you cum- beautiful. Your hairstyle is beautiful. Your house, that tree at your backyard, the lights that come up at night; the weather, your fridge and all that frozen yum-yum are all beautiful; your silence- beautiful. Your eccentricities- beautiful. The soul that agrees with your personality is believed to be beautiful.

Beautiful everywhere, like the air we breathe. 

Every new born is beautiful. Every chicken you are about to eat- beautiful.

Everybody who has helped you is beautiful. Everybody who speaks your mind is beautiful. Your new dress- beautiful.

*”Ugly” is reserved for anything/anyone we cannot comprehend or who threatens our (in)secure social stereotypes*

So how can “beautiful” still hold any real value?

How can we still be obsessed with that cheap frock called "beautiful"?
