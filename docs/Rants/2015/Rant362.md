We finally found Wine that appeals to me -

Arbormist White Zinfandel.

I took two glasses and I think I am in love.

It is mild, aphrodisiac, sweet and respectful

I hope at this point I am still talking about a drink?

LOL!

It comes in strawberry and blackberry flavours.

I donâ€™t understand how I lived all of life thus far without taking alcohol. How boring.

I am stocking the rest of my life with some Arbormist.
