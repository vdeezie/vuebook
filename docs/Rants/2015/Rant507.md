Science. 

Science will prove that paedophilia is a "sexual orientation".

Paedophiles are born that way- to be attracted to children.

Science will inform the world to stop discrimination against paedophiles. 

They cannot do anything about how they feel.

But, of course, they expect them to practice restraint...

Like Baba Ibeji practices restraint on his housemaid.

So how are they going to have sex if they can't have sex with the kind-of-people they are attracted to?

Heteros and homos, isn't attraction a major part of your fuckery? So why the discrimination? They'll question.

They'll fight for acceptance. Come up with more scientific proof of their "normality".

The world will be forced to reduce the age of consent to 13.

Science will bamboozle it's way into your mind. 

You begin to question the reason 9 year olds have full breasts and pubic hair...

If a 9 year old experiences menstrual cycle, then it'll mean they are ripe for sex. Why do we need to deny them something so natural until many years later?

Op-eds for and against will flood social media. More scientific backing.

Minds will be "renewed".

It is time to stop the discrimination. Some children are old people at heart, anyways.

Live and let live.
