I have a confession to make…

I am so so lonely and I need a hug, badly.

I am not the woman in the pictures I post on Facebook.

Who is that? I look nothing like that!

I can’t write. I have no wit.

I could never write a book.

This Art Is Enough? What’s that? Not me.

I am just a very very bitter person

It was when Musiliu dumped me- the mechanic in 1983, the bitterness then seeped into my brain

I have no children

I have never been married

I don’t have a mother. I don't have friends at all.

Bunmi, Prisca, Funmi...huh? Never heard of them!

I have no one to talk to, not even neighbours 

I have no job. Nobody calls me from morning till night.

I have never heard of NASCO.

What is happenings.com.ng? All that money you hear is a lie.

I am a liar, a charlatan.

I am not a feminist. 

It is all in my head. I still believe women should either be in the kitchen or inside a man (or is it the man inside me?)

I am just a big fat façade.

I cry and cry all night because I am seeking attention from the darkness

In the morning time, I am still looking for the attention.

And yes… I am so so lonely and I need a hug, badly.

And I need attention too (ok, I've said that before).

I am not tough or firm or smart or with any skills; just so so lonely and in need of a hug… badly.

...and attention.

Please can you share some of your oh-so amazing life and perfection with me? I am so deprived! Ah bless you!

Phew! I hope my confession answers all your personal problems and diseases. I hope with these few words I am able to cause World Peace; cure Ebola, hypertension, gonorrhoea  and all the earth-shattering political/economic issues of the world.

You're welcome!
