At the salon...

Woman1: Look at my baby's picture. I delivered recently.

Woman2: Ah congrats! You have a flat tummy for someone who jus' did oh. 

(She doesn't have a flat tummy)

Woman1: We thank God. 

Woman2: awww. Your baby is going to be like you. Look at her ears, it's already very dark. 

Woman1: That's not true. She's going to carry my husband's complexion. He is a bit light. Look at my baby's ears very well. It is not too dark.

(The baby's ears are very dark)

Woman2: Ah ok. Fine baby. What diapers are you using...

They are looking my way. They want me to coo into the picture, smile and say the baby isn't going to be "too dark"; or something endearing that would make the mother feel like she gave birth to a beauty.

But I wonder...

Why am I here? 

Why do I care about this stupid weave on my head- curling and twisting?

Why can't I just cut this hair and go bald and focus on more important things?

Is it not a Nigerian like me that just sold his enterprise, hopstop.com, to Apple for $1 billion? 

Chinedu Echeruo, isn't it?

Does he have braids on his head? Or expensive Peruvian weave? Does he go to salons and hear women talk about babies and dark ears?

Has he got two heads?

Why am I in this salon listening to this type of gist when I should cut my hair and find where people sell ideas and businesses for whooping sums?

What is life if we can't be phenomenal?

This is how I work myself up, thinking like a mad woman.

The world that crowns one a billionaire, is the same world that tolerates the others with a load of shabby debts.

It's a soggy plate of beans. This life. But it remains our best coach. Our biggest reward- for dreams, and for hallucinations.
