This is what we complain about all the time.

The comment section of blogs where sexism thrives…

A post on, say, “Genevieve Nnaji gets N40m endorsement”, will have the most distressing remarks, like…

“She is not that fine sef”
“She is too thin. I like my women big.”
“Will she not go and get married?”

We would shout and curse out these ignorant ones, yet we show similar prejudices on our private platforms; practice same abomination.

May 2015… if you haven’t grown brains big enough to understand that part of beating patriarchy to a pulp is by unlearning the shit it stored in your head, then let me remind you…

Body-shaming any woman on my wall is not allowed.

Some of you should stay anonymous on blogs. The filth you are made of cannot conceal itself.

So when you see a post about… “Deola launches Excel Magneto”, for instance…
Leave the shape of Deola’s butt alone. Leave the colour of her eyes. Leave the dress she has on that she bought from Max and is painfully cheap for your high-class ass to accept; focus on the substance.

Is that too hard for your tiny brain to grasp?

If you will not talk about Don Jazzy’s bald after renewing an MTN endorsement contract for a third year running, then shut up and let a woman live her life without being appraised like a piece of furniture.

Do you know what you look like? The averageness of a beauty that never blossomed. That never was.
A croaking unattractiveness that needs too much hair, too much fashion, too much stupidity to mask itself.

Take a good look in the mirror.

Just pause. See. And ask yourself…

“Should I have any opinion about another woman’s physical form?”

I’m done with this subject.

Grab your purse on your way out.
