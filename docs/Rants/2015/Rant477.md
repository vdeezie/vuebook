Under society’s care, your dreams have been sandwiched between fear and dependency. 

Woman, society is against you.

This is not fictive. Do not listen to houseboys.

From every turn, you are insane.

This gender is insane.

If you are told, under any circumstance, that you are made to be under a man- in essence, inferior to a man- in marriage, in career, in business, in family… and you ACCEPT. There is no madness more precise and profound than that.

You must be mad to be alive and ACCEPT an inferior stance. Better to be dead. 

Still you are mad if you contest these issues- these soulless issues made crisp by society. You are mad because they exist only in your imagination. So they tell you. 

This fight for equality can be solved over a few undercooked comments on social media, no? So why all the hullaballoo? Why all these events and sponsorships? Why all these women coming together and yapping endlessly? Who is holding your skirt and your weave?

They simplify your struggle to a few clever words. Make you look like you are, yes, insane. And so you cower.

“May be we are talking too much oh. May be this thing is not really that big a deal. After all, who is holding us?”

You are not in chains, they say. So why all this noise, walk in your freedom.

It’s a trap.

If you can simplify a (wo)man’s struggle, then you render it fluffy  and frivolous.

If you can quickly discard prejudices that long exist with a few crafty words… then you are stupid.

“But what does it matter if a woman likes sex?” 
“I have had female bosses and I got along with them.” 
“If a woman does not want to cook, then she doesn’t have to."
"What about a maid to do the dishes if the woman is too tired to do it. What then is the fuss?”

I hear you. These statements are mainly to entertain your flock. What do you really believe in the dark curves of your heart, at unlit corners of beer parlours?

This conclusiveness is worse than being silently eaten by cancer.

Society is against you, woman.

That is why you are still your own worst enemies.

The problem is not that you are your enemy, the problem is that you believe a woman has to be of a certain kind to agree to this term.

And you think you are not insane?

Pretend you do not know what that means. Act like you are of a better stock that can never see women as their own problems.

But while we are at it, know this…

My sponsors for all my events are mostly women. Yes, you all know a young woman is behind the entire event of #TheConversation holding in Abuja at Transcorp Hilton, and she’s sponsoring 10 of us from Lagos on a luxury treat for two nights. 

I spoke to a friend this morning about a business that will cost me a huge sum to start and I was looking to speak to two prospects. Immediately, she said she’ll fund it.

“How can you have me and you are going to talk to strangers about funding your business?”

She is a woman. Not Jesus. Just a woman looking out for her friend.

So, if anyone should oppose the woman-is-your-worst-enemy stance, it should be me.

I am very conscious of my privileges. 

For women, it is simple- you are either a friend or an enemy. I refuse to complicate my life with "frenemies"; whatever the heck that means. And I will not encourage a clique that needs hate to fuel its ambition. 

If we are not building empires, then we are wasting our time.

Woman, today, I challenge you to end every toxic relationship in your life. Stop holding on to dead plants.

You don’t need half the friends who hover around you.

And, by God, you don’t need half the mess you endure in your relationships.

Your issues, your doubts, your insecurities, your suspicions are not fictive.

Let us talk about them.
