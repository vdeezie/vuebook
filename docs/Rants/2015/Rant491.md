Three things...

1) You don’t tell people how to respond when you attack them.

You don’t have that kind of control over anyone.

If you are foolish enough to provoke, you should stand and brave up any response you get.

It is the other’s prerogative to decide on his/her own reaction.

If you start a war, you have zero rights on the weapon that will be used to smash your head.

2) I don’t understand the idea of hitting people with love.

If they hurt you, show them love to make them uncomfortable?

No nah. If they hurt you, put them on blast…then go on and do something phenomenal with your life. That love-for-hate shit will backfire. Because nobody learned common sense trading off their stupidity for a bag of love.

They’ll be back another day to start all over again that shit you didn’t take care of.

Love those who love you. The rest really don’t count.

3) I am criticised daily for being a Christian. Sometimes you hear the unsaid words, “aren’t you smarter than this religion?”

The same people who think it is uncool to stand for Christ, thinks it’s super-cute for a grown ass 60-something year old man to turn into a woman.

Why don't you show tolerance all through, even if I have to serve a log of wood.

The hypocrisy and stupidity of your being. One day when you utter your last folly, you will drop dead by the corner of the road, as light as a feather.

You would have lived out your idiocy; like an empty bottle of lager beer. 

Lipsticks. Boobs. Long wavy hair. $6million dollars. 1 million followers on twitter in 4 hours… don’t seem to me like something that require my empathy.

Some of these things compel doubt.

Why don’t you let us have our moment of shock and awkwardness and doubts?

Nigerians are such pretentious chumps.

Tell me how you would feel if your father stood up from his favourite couch one evening, after dinner; switched off his favourite programme- News at 10, then addressed his family thus:

“I think I am a woman begging to express myself. I have paid for surgery and from tomorrow, I shall start the process of acquiring the body to go with my inner desires.”

Lie now! Lie that it-is-ok-to-let-him-be-what-he-wants-to-be.

Tell me if you will not die of shame, even if momentarily.

Or would it be out of place if your neighbours thought of him as the anti-Christ? 

We have simply lost ourselves in the many lies that make us feel accepted in a twisted world.
