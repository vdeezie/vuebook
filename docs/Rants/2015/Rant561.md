I'm hiring.

Sales rep.

Female.

There’s this impression that I have a glamorous job.

I don’t.

I am head of a lifestyle website. I am in and out of meetings all the time. I manage writers, manage their professional relationships, their temperaments , their needs.

I sack, I employ. I am enemy, I am friend- depending on what methods I apply on any given day. These judgments fluctuate like PHCN-to-generator.

I am mostly enemy.

I take the blame for bad/slow days, I take the glory for brilliant team performance.

You’ll hear more hateful things about me than good. Even with those I would say I’ve been kind to.

It’s the hazard of the ‘job’.

If I tell you it bothers me, I would be lying.

When I am done not giving a fuck, I am recording episodes of Nasco Moments; setting up an online radio station; producing a magazine; and reading a bunch of articles.

And because I actually do have a conscience, I try to give more than is necessary. So even when I am told by a board that I do not necessarily have to work a 9-5, and allowed to work from home, I am happier in the office- with my team. So I show up more than I am required to. Fighting, shouting, laughing, eating, gossiping, criticizing.

There’s very little time left for anything frivolous- least of all, what is peppering anyone in his/her anus.

Because after all this tough grind, I still don’t have a house in Banana Island…

Or even a Banana tree to call my own.

These things are more important to me than, yes, what is peppering you in your anus fa!

So…where was I?

Yes. Sale Rep. Female. Hustler. Smart. Wise. Prudent.

Try and not bring your boyfriend matter into my life. I don’t care about him.

You work. You earn. I am a good employer. I don’t owe. I can only advice you from my own well of understanding. And my opinion, unfortunately, isn’t popular.

But what does it matter?

From where Linda Ikeji stands, to the rest of us- good writers and bad writers alike- are: the Colossus of Rhodes, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus- all 7 wonders of the world.

In effect, compared to that free-blog-with-no-tax, we are all poor. Yet some writers have the audacity to campaign subtly for poverty as a distinguished position in Literary writing; great obscurity as a sign of lofty writing.

I jus’ dey look una.

But I deviate.

I want a Sales Rep. Please tell your hardworking younger sister or cousin or niece.

PS: Let me go and buy a bunch of banana, and build a house with the peels.
