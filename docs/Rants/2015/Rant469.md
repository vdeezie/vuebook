Let me leave this here before I got to bed…

“I wear my natural hair, I don’t have time for weaves. That’s not where beauty lies…”

“Too much make up is not good for women. You can’t get a serious man like that”

What else…

“Try to exude warmth as a woman so people can feel comfortable around you”

Hypocritical statements give me a rash. 

Don’t speak this nonsense around me again. 

I will cuss you out. And I mean anybody.

Keep your insincere daft opinions to yourselves.

Just stop.

There’s got to be a limit to how the world and other women want to control the woman.

Let her wear her weaves, let her smack her lips with rouge lipstick, let her be loud and gaudy. Let her be anything she wants to be.

YOU go and live your own life!

Go.

The pith of feminism should be to tackle, firstly, the foolish utterances of women.

Good night.
