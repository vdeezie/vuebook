Martin Luther King filed 2,000 people out to a peaceful protest (including Caucasians who travelled across America to lend their support and will to the Black Movement), yet he had no plan???

After a terrible beating on black folks by white authorities, they came back stronger- rallied a more racially appealing and formidable group; yet he got to the point of ‘entry’, touched the floor, looked up and walked back?

“It must have been divine instruction to turn back,” one (white) follower concluded.

“It looked like a set-up,” King insisted.

If he was in our Twitter age, he’d have a saucy hashtag and memes to remind us of how not to plan a rally.

Selma did not connect with my soul. I'm not sure why.

I liked Denzel Washington’s (maybe I should say Spike Lee’s) interpretation of Malcom X better.

King is a distinguished man, a preacher, so yes all that subtlety of being beaten like an animal yet not a finger lifted is all cool; and Oyelowo did a good job at being an eloquent activist, but I like Malcom X’s approach better. And his story was way more entertaining.

X just makes your blood rush to your head! You feel his anger, his pain; you taste his bitterness. He was a mad man, had revolutionary tactics of dealing with black oppression; made some mistakes, disagreed with his “brothers of Islam”… Severed key relationships, and lived only for his own beliefs at the end.

That's what makes him human and flawed and brilliant.

A mad man, the kind of men who can truly bring about change- but don’t live long enough to witness it.

But of course, King IS a great man. Imagine if we had one preacher with his courage and calibre in Nigeria fighting political powers on behalf of the people...
