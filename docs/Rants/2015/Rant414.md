You see, this is how people look for my trouble.

I am sitting close to my window, in my bedroom, responding to a delicious mail from Temidayo Ahanmisi

When I hear voices:

“Do you know who I am? Do you know? My mother is the…”

I shut my brain. Who cares what your mother is or was? I try to concentrate on my mail.

“Please get out; you cannot intimidate me. I have an army of relatives by my side. Do you know where I am from. I have…”

Again, I shut down. I plan to catch up with the fight when they are done flapping worn polo collars.

But they keep at it… “Do you know this… Do you know that…”

Exchange some bloody verbal blows already. Make my day! I cheer them on in my head.

For wia?! They stand there, two men, still talking about “My family name is this…My uncle’s reputation is that…”

“You can’t touch me,” they continued, “I am from the family of…”

...

“Oh please shut the fuck up! You are nobodies!”

That is me, finally tired of their tirade. 

They look up, I quickly shut my window.

“It is that woman upstairs…” someone’s attempt at whispering.

Then giggles from spectators.

Let me go and do my laundry.

Temidayo, you got mail.
