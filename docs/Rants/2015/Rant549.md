I’ll be speaking to Unilag students this Friday at the Weavers’ Club.

I remember when I was in school and we had similar events; I would go to the hall with my heart in my hands, begging for knowledge, pleading to be told how the world works without any pretense.. How one person succeeds greater, how talent meets success, and success cuddles wealth.

Cut the bullshit and tell me the truth, I’d grumble.

For every event I attended, I was disappointed. The speakers would make us laugh, share trivial stories about their palatial positions, tell us how much they love their husbands or wives, tell us about their visits to Europe, and dinner with a personality they hold in some kind of importance.

I left school and was paying N15,000 to N25,000 to listen to these deadbeat motivational speakers (they didn’t seem deadbeat then). My mates were using money to buy bags and shoes, I bought a Bible worth N32,000. A well-versed spiritual encyclopedia that broke the scripture into tiny bits of wit that could speak directly to my needs.

In the real world of public speaking in Nigeria, nobody tells the truth. That’s why we have zero books on successful Nigerians. If at all you find any, there’s the huge gap between selling ogiri in 1998 to getting their first Armani suit in 2005. A gap filled with different twisted half-truths every time you bump into an interview of them in magazines or blogs. The shameless inconsistencies.

For whatever reasons, our stories don’t add up. Or we just don’t know how to be sincere. Religion isn’t helping much; testimony time in Churches is just a charade, a piece of our daily farts blown into the faces of worshipers.

Ask the woman raising her hands to heaven how she got her miracle baby. Ask the man who made “a miraculous sum” in business how he moved from N2,000 in his account to N100,000million in a few years.

There are no answers. We just thank God sha.

And so we go round and round as young people looking for answers.

On Friday, I will share the truth with these young writers.

They want me to talk about books.

Books? No. I will not talk about something that doesn’t put food on my table. I will talk about WRITING and finding the genre that can make you prosper.

Do not strive to be a hungry author. We still do not have the formula to succeeding as book authors in Nigeria. Bookshops are closing down; telecom/tech gadget companies are taking over spaces once occupied by books. Authors have to keep other jobs to be able to pay rent… 

So what are we talking about? Who are we fooling?

Where is the money in writing? It is defintely not in books.

So why are we talking about being authors in Nigeria when the trade isn’t able to get you any kind of comfort/luxury?

The second edition of Happenings magazine is out, cheque is already in for a full page for next edition.

I have not made that sum writing or talking about books.

Books don’t pay my bills.

I can conveniently make certain sums writing, editing, selling magazines. Scritpwriting, online editing, a few other thriving genres. 

These are practical life lessons. If you have a talent, find the genre that you most likely will make sensible money from.

Don’t go and lie to students to become authors, only for them to struggle through their 20s hoping to win an award with cash prize, and finally, out of frustration, settle to become a clerk at a hospital or a cashier in a bank after 7 wasted years of seamless fiction and topnotch literature.

Our environment is not responding to literature and the methods we have in place; it is responding well to magazines…present these realities during your long speeches.

Now, how can students who love to write and look up to you find their niche?

If you can write a book, you can write for a magazine too. Let them know 
this.

One thousand copies of magazine for a month is hardly enough. In a few weeks, it’s all gone and you need to do reprints as requested by advertisers.

One thousand copies of books, however, will stay with you for months and you will count your pennies until the next published book.

I am (not) sorry, but I am a business woman. Writing has got to pay my bills. My talent is not an embellishment on my adire blouse; it is my purpose; the reason for being. My talent has to protect my dignity and provide my needs.

I will tell them so.

If they want an author to come and talk about fluffy, cottony literary issues over exasperating sentences, that day will come…with another guest speaker.

PS: a picture to go with the long rant. I think I'll wear this dress on Friday. Should I take cupcakes along? No? *Kanye shrug*
