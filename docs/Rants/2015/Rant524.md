When they talk about..

Venice and culture of consumption...
Medieval plagues, war and heresy...
Holocaust and genocide... 
The Renaissance in Italy... 
Racism in America...
Hitler's Germany...
The Middle East Jihad resistance... and all the historical krinkrum krankrum...

You would think they would be able to piece together a simple issue as Feminism.

No. With all their historical wisdom, their brain drops like wet shit in paper bag the minute they have to talk about the Nigerian woman and the Oha soup she must die cooking. 

I have come to understand that the Nigerian gets a thrill, a pleasurable squeeze of the balls... orgasm even, when they misinterprete Feminism.

There's the illusion of trending on twitter and getting a pat on the back on Facebook.

With all your historical knowledge, you manage to look as badly cooked as soggy beans because you met one or two Nigerian feminist who do not like to cook.

Where's your common sense? Who are you to decide what role an adult should play in his/her own marriage. 

You wash the cars in your house, your wife cooks...

Who made you God to decide that is the prototype for all marriages and homes?

Like someone special said to me last night...

"Why should I worry about a cooking woman when I can get a partner that can run the world with me?"

50+ years into independence yet Nigeria is one of the most misgoverned country in the world with corruption around her neck like a garotte...

Yet these fools want Nigerian feminism to be as decisive and complete as is practiced in their tiny brains; away from the realities of the country they operate in.

If the movement takes its full course of radicalism and misconstruction. Let it.

After all, you and your manliness still suffer dick failure sometimes...when you wanna get it up, is it not? 

So what's the rush in a movement that only got its own crisp voice just a few years ago?

Daft.
