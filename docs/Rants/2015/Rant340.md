I’m not crazy about kids- at all. After one minute chilling with kids, I am craving adult company; adult conversation, with the measure of wit that makes me feel like this is ‘home’.

I may not be into kids but I am a responsible person. And I think that is more important than even love. 

Love will sit down and hold her kids and they’d cry together for lack of food. Responsibility, however, will leave the kids at home, go out there, grab a bird and roast it for the kids to eat. 

Whilst love is busy planting kisses on her children’s forehead, Responsibility is knocking on doors with the aim of getting that bread for the kids to eat.

Love will share a small bed with the kids. Responsibility will sleep on the floor and let the kids have the bed.

Love will share a small meal with the kids. Responsibility will go hungry for the children’s satisfaction.

I am very thorough with kids. So thorough it’s almost clinical.

There’s a set of girls in my ‘hood that stopped going to school. They’ve been at home for over one year. Girls of my children’s age. 

I asked the older one once, “What happened to school?”
“My dad is going to get us into a better one; he says he doesn’t like the other one…yada yada…”

Dad (whom I have never seen) and mum are still looking for the school apparently- over a year later.

I got so irritated by this mum that I stopped talking to her. You haven’t earned my “good morning” if your kids stay at home peeping through gated balcony, watching other kids go to school; sometimes running into their apartment when they can’t take it any longer (Nigerians, please don’t come here and tell me: “you never know, maybe the woman is going through financial hardship.” Aren’t we all?)

Love is good for kids. But I choose to be responsible above all.

Love can be irresponsible. As a matter of fact, Love is almost always irresponsible.

But Responsibility cannot function without love. 

So if you ask me, “would you choose to be a parent in your next life?” 

I would say, “No”; because it is hard work, given that I will not compromise on the things they need. I am detailed to a point of paranoia as it concerns kids. And I don’t cut parents any slack at all. 

Give children the best or don’t have them at all.

PS: In my next life I choose to be responsible for only the quality of lingerie I wake up in.
