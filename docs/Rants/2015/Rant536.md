If you follow all the yarn about angry feminism and the lacking-in-finesse of the Nigerian feminists...

Then this is how we will be expected to address the issue of the girl left to drown, because her (fucking) father would rather have her dead than "touched" and "dishonoured" by lifeguards in Dubai. 

So here goes...

So as not to be described as angry and tactless, we shall gather quietly at Oriental hotel and talk about the aso-ebi we need to buy before we speak another word on the plight of women in certain countries. 

One of us will be a trader in this business, of course. We shall pay N10k each for fuchsia lace.

Banner with the body of the dead girl shall be designed to proudly display the words...

"Women lives matter. Too."

We shake our heads in mourning and talk in hush tones. When we put up any post on the matter on social media we shall use fine words like...

"Ham-fisted" "Maladroit" "Bungling" "Gauche"... to describe society. 

We shall not talk directly at the father lest we be defined as "bitter" and "man haters".

Tread softly.

We shall gather at a location on the Island. Ruby woo and branded t-shirt in the morning...

Fuchsia lace and a mourn-the-girl-child conference at night, with Champagne, smoothies, red velvet cake and jollof rice.

Speeches shall be made by women who know how to contain their anger and grief.

To add a bit of "stability" to the entire set-up, we shall get a man panache, according to society's book, to join us in grieving in style (Lest we be described as "bitter" and man haters").

Tonye Cole or Lane Olusola comes to mind.

Get the press to cover a row of women weeping elegantly into handkerchiefs.

The next day the picture of true genteel feminists shall be on the front cover of Vanguard with the caption:

A gathering of feminists during the mourning session for dead girl in Dubai.
