I have never, in all of my years, heard anyone describe a man as "bitter".

He is a bitter man.

Never heard that. Have you?

Apparently "bitterness" is a word reserved only for women, mostly by women.

Men who beat up their wives are not bitter, just violent.

Men who steal and misbehave in public offices are merely thieves.

Men who rape. "Just" rapists.

Men who cannot comprehend anything beyond the urge to cum are just, well, men.

Women ensure bitterness is only attributed to their kind. 

When you meet a woman whose energy, passion, drive, no bullshit attitude you cannot comprehend...

The easiest thing to brand her is "bitter".

Because your brain is incapable of learning and forming new words.

You are, after all, an African woman. You need to breastfeed your child, take care of your husband, make many friends, run a regular life which in itself is not bad...

But the idea that if the next woman does not process information like you or find your kind of lifestyle appealing immediately makes her bitter, is what qualifies you as stupid.

I keep saying it everyday, let women be whatever the hell they want to be.

And that brings me to Feminism...

All these silly women who should be content with buying lace for weddings and trying to hustle for contracts under the new political dispensation should stop building essays around Feminism and Bitterness.

Your stupidity is on 3D.

In the bible (hard deal to bring religion into this but...) it was said that the dejected, angry and bitter joined David's camp. 

David's camp was the new cause at the time, it was the new movement.

In a patriarchal situation where women are trying to know who they are and find their voices, Feminism will house the bitter, the dejected, the angry.

In the true essence of Christianity, Jesus says: If you are lonely, dejected, confused, come to me. Join my movement.

So do you see how vile you are when you will not allow women find their healing under Feminism? Anger is one process to heal. 

But what do you know apart from turning amala. 

I suspect these Owambe women who just woke up in the middle of the feminist movement in Nigeria with breasts heaving with opinions, want us to turn the movement to a happy-go-lucky gig where we get drunk and eat cake. 

They want it to be another Nigerian wedding with a lot of pretentious people and blunt happiness that is unable to cut butter.

They want feminism to be as chirpy as political rallies, with a lot of dancing and incoherent friendships. 

Sorry oh, but Feminism is for the bitter woman too. Whatever that means.

If your head, beaten unconsciously to submission by patriarchy, can hardly define a man as bitter, but quickly summarises the next woman's voice and efforts as such...

Then you should worry that you have the IQ of a panda.

A big dumb lump.

So let us imagine, indeed, women are the only bitter species...

Where do you suggest they go for "healing"?

To church? To a therapist (how much per session)? To the open market? To a friend? 

I think the "bitter woman" made bitter by societal wrongs should join a movement that addresses those wrongs. 

This IQ thing remains a big challenge sha.

My sister, Feminism is too deep for you.

Go and binge on icecream.
