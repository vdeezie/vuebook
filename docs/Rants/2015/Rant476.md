We got talking about Ebuka Obi-Uchendu in the office today.

Some new endorsement he signed with a fashion house and new pictures thereof.

Nothing of interest to me, but my writers kept going on and on about his looks; how hot he is.

Funny, it was the male writers that were awestruck with his charm.

"I'm not gay, but damn this guy is hot!" one of them said.

Lets call him Bee. 

Very hardworking, loyal writer. One I can count on. He'd call to see how I am doing even after work hours. Call to know if I have any of my personal events during weekends he could give me a hand with. 

Always on time. Gets the job done fast. Very presentable. Without airs. Very respectful. Sensitive too. Follows my gaze and would ask if I am ok or overworked or tired. Tries to make me laugh all the time. Goes on about my work ethics... how good he thinks I am.

He would be the first to compliment a dress or a smile I have on.

Good looking, well dressed. Proper hygiene. Impressive carriage. This writer.

Dancing in his early 30s. I think. Just a bundle of high spirit and good genes. 

I like to take him along for meetings. Good eye candy for women in top corporate position. Something easy on the eye to incite the right answers.

"Yes. We can do business." (That's just sexist. I know. I know. Poor dude. Lol!)

And I'm looking at him going on and on about Ebuka. 

"You have no idea, do you?"

"No idea, boss?"

"You are way hotter than Ebuka. Way!"

"Ah! Boss. That can't be true."

"Ebuka is 110% confidence. That's all he's got that you don't have...yet."

"For real?"

"For real."

And he carried on for the rest of the day with some bounce to his gait.

If you are lucky to have people in your life who can look you in the eye and tell you a truth...

"You are brilliant."
"You are one in a million." 
"You got it." 
"You stand out."
"I am glad I met you."

You will find your rhythm.

And if the words don't come, tell yourself a truth...

"Fuck it. I'm good at this shit."

Then go on into the wild with your bad self.
