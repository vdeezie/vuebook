Viola Davies makes history as first black woman to win best actress at the Emmys’

The real winner is Shonda Rhimes

If there was no Shonda to create a role to portray a black woman as sexy, successful, sought after, independent and smart; roles typically reserved for a certain kind to satisfy Caucasian specifications…

If Shonda did not think Viola deserved a lead role…

They’d be no win for Viola, regardless of talent.

I am high on opportunities. Walahi, I don’t understand people who snub or are indifferent about certain chances given to them

Talent is nothing without opportunity 

Impressive talent needs a platform

Your talent is only as good as the platform you are given. Anything else is just you and your ego and the life lessons you need to learn to understand how the world works.

Best actress can only happen when talent appreciates opportunity 

Shonda Rhimes continues to use her privileges (created by hard work and persistence) to promote women of her kind.

We celebrate Viola today because Shonda Rhimes exists.

It’s a cycle of beautiful stories. 
 
Congrats to the great woman of Television - Shonda Rhimes.

...and Uzo Aduba wins again with little fanfare. Babe, your time will come. Keep shining those awards. Crazy eyes is my best character in OITNB.
