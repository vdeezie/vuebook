Meet my fashion writer, Ezinne- young, vibrant, cool. Fast learner too!

Fresh out of Madonna University, this is her first writing job.

After interviewing nine writers, all with prospects (one had a Masters’ and was the most unimpressive), I settled for Ezinne.

I drilled her on her assignments until she bled; and would instruct her to use that blood as ink…

She was terrified by me at first, but I didn’t care.

There was something in her and I was going to do my bit as an editor to let it shine.

One day she came to work worried, I asked what the problem was, and she said:

“My dad wants me to get a bank job.”

Imagine the hianity! People just think they can look down on writers from the tip of their noses. Shior!

“Tell your dad we pay higher than any fucking bank. And I won’t send you to an old rich man with the libido of ten monsters to beg for N30million naira just so you can meet ridiculous financial targets.”

Nansense! Young people should start learning how to argue their future out of pigeonholed decisions parents are always eager to make for them, abeg.

(PS: Bankers, one love oh!)

She says she likes my guts. “I just stare at you always, Ms. Joy. Never met anyone so – “

“Crazy?”

“Yes! Oh yes! You are crazy Ms. Joy. Aren’t you afraid of being disliked?”

“Hate is good or you might not achieve anything. Love is water, hate is fuel. Both very important in today’s society. You need ten gallons of fuel for every cup of water you drink...”

She had her brow raised, totally confused; more questions burning in her eyes. But nor be one day lizard go turn alligator nah.

LOL!

Anyway, I told her to do a top 5 quirky style on Mr. Limpopo, Kcee today. 

I was laughing so hard when I read it,  I just had to share. Here's her critique of this picture, attached:

“Hmm this outfit ehn, I can’t touch it o! The shoes match the car? It gives a new meaning to the word accoutrement! Why he folded that jeans so high, I have no idea. The belt is so big it just screams, ‘Look at me, I think I’m rich!’ His style is so predictable. Think of overdone, over accessorized and quirky, that’s Kcee for you…”

LMAO! Proud of her.
