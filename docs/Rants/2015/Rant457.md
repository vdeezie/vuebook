Man 1: Every African woman should be treated right. They have sacrificed so much for their men.

Woman 1: God bless you, brother. We give and give and build homes. I am glad our men can see this and appreciate.

Woman 2: Some of our men appreciate, not all. It is important to be with the right man.

Man 2: African women are the best.

Woman 1: Exactly. It is important to to be with the right one. Wait and continue building yourself. The right one will come.

Man 3: My beautiful sisters, the road has been long. But you are appreciated. You are the sun of the earth and we appreciate you. 

Woman 3: I thank God for the men I am surrounded with. They acknowledge the true beauty of the African woman.

Man 4: It's not about hips or thighs, it's about values and purpose. There's nothing more beautiful than a real african woman.

Woman 4: As long as the woman continues to live according to purpose, she will find all that her heart desires. Love will come in its time. Happiness and fulfilment will come in the morning. Let's continue to encourage the African woman.

You see how cute and flowery and sweet this conversation sounds?

Ok. Sorry to burst your bubble, but...

It is a pile of sexist hogwash. 

Why should the "African woman" be "treated right"? 

Right by whom?

Men. No?

It always boils down to how men should treat women. In this case, the "African woman"- the bottom-pot species. To be handled with care else she shatters to the floor like a piece of cheap flower vase.

See ehn, empower yourselves.

If there's anything I have said in over 450 rants that haven't sunk in, let this be an exception.

Empower yourselves.

How anyone treats you is totally irrelevant. That is not why we are here.

That is not the purpose of being.

We are pursuing the wrong things. It's the colourful distraction patriarchy encumbers us with while the world passes us by.

Find self. A potent reason to be alive. 

And stick to it.

Women, "let whoever think whatever. You just keep getting better."
