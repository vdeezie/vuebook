I wrote an article recently titled:

"Men, it's 2015. Cook your own food and wash your own clothes."

From one end of the Internet to the other, the comments were hilarious:

"If Joy is tired, Jane can take over." 
(Lol! Women have suffered)

"So who is going to take care of me and the children?" 
(I checked this one's profile. He is barely 23. Talk about reproducing the same shit from generation to generation)

"Please, is the writer married? Because I don't think her husband will be happy to read this. If she isn't, then I don't think her family especially her brothers will be pleased."
(awww. Such kind and gentle ignorance)

"And she's fine oh. Let's cut her some slack." (Putrid patriarchal statement)

"I don't need her to cook. My house boy will cook for me." 
(I can't get over this one. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But then... how could I have expected anything close to sensible from where it came from. People who just love to argue like they got hit on the head too many times as kids)
***
We don't need a man to kick a woman and four children out of the house by midnight with their clothes raining down from a three storey building to know patriarchy is on display.

It doesn't have to be so obvious. As a matter of fact, the worst kind comes dressed as conversation in a "civil" setting, disregarding the plain issues of inequality. 

Like the coconut heads up there.

I had an interview some years back where I said, "I function better in a boardroom than in a kitchen..."

Oh boy! You should see the comments on that site. They tried all they could to beat me into submission- sticks and stones. Arab style. 

We are mostly hypocrites on this subject of patriarchy. Any clever answer to belittle the issue of inequality excites the average Nigerian.

Even when we think we are supporting the movement for a balanced society, we are caught up in patronising retorts and responses that expose how much of patriarchy we need to unlearn.

Fast.
