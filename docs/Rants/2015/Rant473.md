I was a young girl when this happened, but I remember clearly the conversation my mum had with a certain neighbour. 

I thought I didn’t understand because I was too young to comprehend this adult discussion, but it turned out my mum couldn't grasp what the woman was really on about either.

“He jus’ dey do anyhow for de marriage. I don tire. Jus’ as e like…as the word take sweet for im mouth na so e go be. I nor get word wey go land for ground. My husband nor go let my word land…e get word for everything and e go talk am so tay I go confuse. I don taya. Make I go rest for village small. I nor sure say I go come back sef.”

How do you just get tired because your husband’s words “dey sweet for im mouth.” My mother, I’m sure, was left even more confused about the situation.

The couple weren’t violent or difficult. Surely anything else can be resolved over a hot meal.

But when I grew older, I began to dissect her issues. 

You see, her husband was manipulative. He forced his judgments on her; and he did it with the strength of words.

When he was happy, he would talk persuasively about the pleasures of happiness.
When he was bitter, he would sell a different pack of words to justify this emotion.
And he would thrust his words into her head, shutting down her thoughts and beliefs.

If she were to catch him on top of a woman; he would soon find words to support the need for adultery; and she'd nod along in agreement. 

Intelligent people are like that. They are easily manipulative; there’s a pretext behind every mood and they’ve got the body of words to sell their current disposition.

The next day if he wakes up and doesn’t feel like forgiveness is such a good idea…regardless of what he sold fervently the day before, he is going to give you rational highbrow justification for his new stance.

Eventually the woman cracked and saw through her husband’s issues.

It is not a good reason to leave a marriage, but it was such a breakthrough for me to finally understand what that woman was trying to share.

See ehn, we are all humans. Your emotions are valid; when they are not, you’d find handcuffs on your wrist. 

It is ok to forgive and it is ok not to.
It is ok to judge and it is ok not to.
It is ok to give and it is ok not to.
It is ok to be angry and it is ok to be happy.

It is OK.

There is time for everything under the sun.

Let your own personality shine through.

And if you feel like slamming a glass cup on the wall… go ahead and do it. 

It is valid.

It's midnight. Good night
