You check into a hotel.

You notice your complimentary bottles of water are missing.

You inform reception, but first you hurry off to a meeting.

Six hours later, fatigued and thankful that you don’t have to sit through traffic…

You take the 10 minutes drive to your room…

There, you find complimentary bottles waiting for you, like voodoo dolls.

You are shaken, but for a minute the receptionist cannot understand why.

It is scary to know that anyone in a hotel can have entry into your privacy. 

In a sick world, you have to ensure your customers feel safe.

Swallow your master key. Nobody wants to be reminded, through careless actions, that there’s a key somewhere that can have access to them…

A key is only a tool of security when it is in the hands of the intended possessor.

“Why do you have complimentary bottles of water in a room I locked and headed out with the key?”

“Oh! So sorry, ma.”

But it’s more than just sorry.

It is uncomfortable for me to focus on the one thing that brought me here – the need to work without distraction.

There’s a key somewhere that can lead anyone in. Even with a flimsy inner lock, I still don't like the eerie feeling of this oh.

That master key led someone into my room, my space without permission.

That all-knowing, all-present status of hotel managements can be annoying sometimes.

What if the master key finds its way into the hands of a sociopath, dealing with many issues; vengeful issues. You know? 

 *sigh*
