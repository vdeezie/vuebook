I have always questioned the hypocrisy of kindness from as little as when I was 8.

I think it was in my headmistress’ office, and a parent was complaining about her child, and she said:

“After all this wahala, he will grow up, marry and forget me.”

I mulled over that statement and marvelled at its selfishness.

It is a very selfish statement. And I have heard people say it too many times.

“What if I help him and we break up?”
“What if I train her and then she takes my job?”
“What if I show her love and she uses it against me?”

Why do we bother with kindness if what we are really looking for is approval- some kind of heroic endorsement from the other person?

I cringe at half the kindness I have received. They are so plainly hypocritical that I flinch and feel sorry being the receiver. Kindness that is hard to accept because the giver is expecting something in return.

I don’t know about you, but I don’t take care of my kids so that one day they will “remember me”. And I try not to do anything for my mum with recompense as motive.

There have been kindness I have received that I wish I could give back; and at one time, so burdened by the weight of someone’s duplicity, I had asked:

“Can I give you back that which you gave me in the guise of kindness?”

The only few circumstances I expect reward is with a job. If I work hard, I should be paid. My expectations are very high with work because I pour myself into the projects I have accepted to take on. 

Recently I overheard a conversation:

“I would cook fresh fish peppersoup from mile 2 and carry it to Ojo; cleaned his house; helped organise his life; followed him to all the key gatherings he attended; and stomached many things…and he still did this to me.”

That is the sort of kindness I don’t understand. It is troubled with a desperate need for recompense that it weighs on the next person like plutonium on his neck.

The man in this conversation is expected to act “accordingly” because the woman did certain kind things, displayed a big heart in the relationship, and pretended all his bullshit was ok. In return she wanted fidelity; but you see, it doesn’t work that way. Your kindness is flawed and more indecent than even his act of disloyalty.

That’s how I see it.

People want what they want and so they flaunt kindness. Deep in the well of such charity are deep-seated elements of control, despair, and a flushing need to be accepted.

Personally, I don't think children owe parents anything except to live a good life on their own terms. The job of fulfillment cannot be passed to another person no matter how much they love you.

I did say to my mother once: "It is not my duty to make you happy." And yet I love her more than anyone else in the world..

I have long resolved that whatever I do to be kind to another, it would be to my peace; not that I would require anything back- even to my children.

Because in the act of kindness, I see that everyone is counting their gains and losses, and thus purging it of (its) altruism.
