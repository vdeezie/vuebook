I recall that receipt that appeared on blogs last year- a few guys at a Lagos club consumed liquor worth all of N10million on a Friday night.

N10 million for a few drinks, in a few hours, just for a few people at one location.

If you don’t know yet that Life is a tragic-comedy, then you don’t know.

Someone sits on a bar stool and spends the kind of money that will solve the problems plaguing your entire household; he spends it on alcohol, in one night.

It’s both hilarious and excruciating.

The fact that you hold no claim to that money; the fact that it is not a crime to spend that kind of sum on alcohol; the fact that it is not even morally wrong; the fact that your condition isn’t their problem; they owe you no explanation, they owe you nothing...

It’s the kind of situation that, if you give it a thought, changes your life.

Forever.

Close your Twitter account and think about it for a minute.
