The Feminist Guide to Sexual Empowerment:

When you have shared a penis...

Buy the ex a bottle of wine and attach a sweet note: "Girl, i just landed this dick. How did you cope? That thing needs a new owner. Here's a drink for persevering."

Go out for lunch together and talk about balls.

Give cool air kisses when you meet at events, with a wink.

Propose a threesome...but with a hotter male.

Joke about her taste in men then send her a picture of Usher with a text: "one more thing we should have in common. Those abs!"

Call her immediately you become the latest ex and go lingerie shopping together. (Don't stay on twitter yapping deluded shit)

Find a male stripper club and pay for both of you to get your pubic hair waxed.

When you both jam your mutual ex at the mall, take a selfie and tag it: "the common denominator"

If you have common career interests, collaborate on an EXceptional project. 

If your feminism is still stuck on natural hair battle and is yet to reach this level;  you have not started.
