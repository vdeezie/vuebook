I don't like folks who feel entitled. 

I don't like folks who feel entitled.

I don't like folks who feel entitled.

Everything that comes to you is a privilege.

Be grateful. 

The world owes you nothing. 

When you stop receiving the good (from others) you believe is your right, shut your big mouth of entitlement and go and get what you want for yourself. By yourself.

Be vexed enough to do it on your own. Stop whining. 

Not your mother, not your brother, not your friend, not the government owes you anything. 

Not even God. Shoot! 

There are no entitlements in this world. None. 
Live every opportunity with gratitude that can sweep a city.

Be enthusiastic. 

I can't say it enough. 

Live enthusiastically.

I believe in giving a 100% to life, to your career/job...

But not to people. 

Give a 100% to your dreams. 

Your dreams will not betray you.

I am TIRED of sob stories.

She did this...He did that... They did that...

And all the bloody memes that continue to display your sense of entitlement.

1. Those who stand with me to watch me grow, are the truest friends. *roll eyes*

2. Let my enemies live long and see what... mehn, shut up already. 

No one is that interested in another's success or failure.

We are paying exorbitant school fees here. We don't have time to see how pale your grass is on the other side.

Water the damn thing. By yourself. 

Get your revenge by Winning.

Keep winning.

Your job is to WIN.

That's all.

Shock the hell out of me - WIN.

Or maybe not.

As long as you don't think it is up to anyone to help you...

Let help come, and when it does, have the common sense to be grateful...to give something back in return.

Life is business. Even if all you are trading is kindness in return.

Just don't come around this bend feeling like Tom Cruise or Angelina Jolie making decisions whether to accept or reject the major role in 'Salt'.

That's not how it works.
