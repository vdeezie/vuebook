# Rant411


March 26, 2015

This rant is all over the place, so bear with me.

See ehn, I don’t judge women.

It is almost impossible to find me in a conversation beating a woman down.

But I defend myself from stupid women. The minute you talk shit about me, I am on you like torrent of stones falling from the sky. 

Sodom and Gomorrah kind of torment. You will die, figuratively. I am merciless like that.

But if you respect yourself and mind your business, I will stand with you as a woman for ages, you would think there was more to my loyalty.

-Because women have been run down for too long; I am not in the business of investing in that enterprise.

Men run women down.

Women run down other women.

Society then wraps her up in a cloth and throws her into a morgue.

For people like me I will defend a woman, almost to a point of delirium.

Personally ehn, I am tired of all this stupid “Advise for Women” that prop up from men who have been around the bloc too many times.

They go back and marry the one they left a thousand times for “sisi eko”, and when they are accepted at old age, begin to share their half-baked advice to women who are not like their baby mama/wives who took them back.

Fuck off abeg!

Nobody should care what these people say, but this is Society, and anything that can make a woman look stupid is just the right syrup for their headache.

This is not primarily my business, but it concerns my gender and all the advice comedians and musicians have to offer women. 

Seriously? You have naked Caucasian women all over your videos, you have dated them when you were the ish in comedy. So prune your lawn and leave your advice at the door for ONLY your kids.

Live your own life; enjoy the bosom of your wife- the one you left for a long time and returned to, and leave others to live on their own terms.

On to the next abeg! 

I read where Stephanie Coker turned down a banana Island apartment blah blah

I might turn it down too, because I am a stubborn ass woman and I like to make MY own decisions, be the pilot of my own plane…the thought of living in a man’s rented house will not work well with my ego- the size of a pumpkin.

BUT if a chick took the offer, I am one of those women who see absolutely nothing wrong with it.

I am sorry if anyone is disappointed by this declaration, but I’ll be shocked if I still disappoint anyone.

You should know I live to disappoint your set rules, because I find them despicable.

I know old men who lived recklessly, got broke, ran back to their first baby mamas, and under her care are able to hide their shame…

Then they become seers for women, throwing idiotic instructions everywhere.

Just shut up.

It’s hard to blame these men though…women remain their own worst critics.

So if you turn down a car or an apartment…by all means move on with your righteous self.

One of my good friends married as a VIRGIN. An adult in her 30s, married as a virgin!

The marriage ended, and even as she stayed on the right path till the end, the husband was a disgrace.

If he had married her after two kids out of wedlock with a banana Island house to throw in, it would be that she deserved the breakup because she is…
a) Materialistic
b) Not a virgin
c) Baby out of wedlock
d) Not a virtuous woman
e) All of the above

There are no rules, abeg. Live your life; mind your business, and let others live theirs.
