When people say, “you are going to regret leaving me.”

What does that even mean?

Love in the metropolis rests on two needs- sex and companionship.

Those are very basic things you can get almost anywhere.

Even though we like to think of companionship as some ethereal experience we need to cherish, truth is you can find it in one out of ten people; and that makes it a basic requirement in a city of over 25 million people.

These threats are silly at best. 

I was just sitting on my own jejely waiting for a meeting to kick off when the receptionist, obviously blinded by pain and rage from lost love, started choking on the phone...

“He jus’ fuck up sha. He jus’ fuck up. And he will regret it. He never learn how to treat me right *sic*, and somebody else will…and he will regret it.”

Regret bawo?

*whew*

Unless you have a map to the success of his business or career, or instrumental in some ways to his progress beyond your boobs making his penis hard, I doubt there’ll be any regrets. 

Most relationships are physical, we manage to convince ourselves there’s something “special” here… probably the cooking or the way she twists her waist…or even something as ridiculous as the way he smiles. 

We just find something…anything to assure ourselves this is better than the former.

It’s all basic.

And you need to stop delegating your happiness to someone else.
