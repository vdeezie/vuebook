I can’t take Nigerian anger or aggression seriously, I’m sorry.

It amuses me how it always plays out, this anger that we love to display every time things don’t go as we hope.

Our anger starts off very unsure of itself, “should I be angry, should I not?”

Then it begins to grow the minute we can confirm a kindred spirit somewhere; it accelerates when we can look around to see just as much fume coming out from everyone’s nose.

Our anger has no purpose, it just needs popular endorsement. And the reason we are very average people is because of this general validation we always seek.

Nobody ever made a success of anything because they had 500 friends who are ready to defend them on Facebook. 

Nothing is achieved on apps with a hundred people daily praising their works.

Nobody ever moved an inch closer to a goal because they get a 100 RTs.

These things mean NOTHING. I don’t know how many times I have to keep saying this before it sticks.

The shit that happens on social media is NOT real!

None of it is real. Don’t you get it?

Shut that laptop and go and find your spot in the game called life.

*whew*

But I deviate.

So back to this our common anger…

A man threatens to kill another man after brushing his car…if the other man is able to match up to his anger, anger becomes a coward and begins to seek other emotions to set it free.

I remember back then in school, when a cultist was ‘toasting’ me, and he thought his best tool for wooing was to, well, try and brag about how he was going to beat up a rival badly. Of course I was unimpressed, but this is a cultist who was promising me a “helluva ride in school", even though I thought he was an idiot and I wanted nothing to do with him, I had to be sure my "NO" wouldn't set him off on a vengeful quest.  

I was a freshman, I wasn’t afraid, but I was very careful. You’ll play along or else they’d put a gun to your head out of jealousy (seeing you’d rather be with someone else).

So we would go for drinks. I don’t take alcohol so he’d ask for a crate of Malt to be delivered to my room… and sometimes, hoping to impress his friends, he would “lovingly” coerce me to drink from his glass of beer *roll eyes*

One day, the rival who had just about had enough of this guy’s rant about town, showed up at the restaurant he always took me to. Unfortunately for my toaster, I was with him at that hour, and so were four of his fellow ‘eye’ peeps.

The rival- ten times a braggart, twenty times ready-to-lay-his-life-for-his-dignity, put a gun on the table and said:

“I’m not here to shoot you; I am here to disgrace you in front of your girlfriend and your squad. Come outside NOW let me beat the shit out of you ‘cos I am sick of hearing you brag about something we both know you are incapable of achieving.”

Na so bobo toaster mellow oh. His crew started to “beg” on his behalf. The dingy school had just suffered another cult meltdown with two people dead and they didn’t want any confrontation with a rival gang.

Finally Tokunbo was appeased, but before he left, he turned and said to me:

“What are you doing with this loser?”

But I wasn’t with the loser. I wasn’t with anyone. Free me. LOL!

Women are always in the middle of angry men. In tertiary institution, where everyone plays the immortal card, you learn to keep your cool and watch the true nature of anger- as light as feather, this Nigerian anger, take its course

Go to Lagos motor parks and see how area boys live out anger. One minute, they are spinning venomous words like award-winning rap artistes, threatening to slice somebody’s head in two. The next minute, N20 is placed in their palms and they start to sing promises of buying the same person a bottle of beer.

On social media, people communicate anger by displaying angry emoticons. I’m sorry, but if you have to scroll through your phone to find an expression of anger to show how angry you are, then you are not yet angry.

They get so angry, yet they are able to celebrate the number of retweets achieved from an "angry tweet. *sigh*

Your bandwagon anger is hilarious at best. If anger has not yet set you out of social media to go and get a position on the corridors of where you can effect change, your anger hasn’t yet begun. 

But you have my sympathies at this hour.

As I am sure you will all be fine, eventually.
