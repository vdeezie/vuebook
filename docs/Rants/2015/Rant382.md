I think the biggest tragedy in politics is that the average Nigerian always plays a partisan role.

It’s like losing blood and asking for a glass of water to keep you alive instead.

You are dying because these set of people from whatever political party they come from have continuously sucked your essence. They do this because you are easily distracted, easily excited, too happy. 

I don’t understand this Nigerian happiness at all. I think it is a big problem that stands in the way of meaningful success. Every little damn thing makes the Nigerian happy. It’s depressing!

And you think too small; only amongst your peers- how you wish to buy a bigger generator than your neighbour; or date a girl with bigger boobs than your friend’s.

I don’t understand how anyone with intelligence worth more than a plate of agoyin beans can be so convincingly partisan as a regular person living with the habitual discomfort of being Nigerian.

We have to grow beyond the symbols that differ one party from the other; they all suffer the same malaise and the same chomps of victory.

You can churn out a hundred reasons not to vote for that party and the same number of reasons why you should. It’s a game that a poor Nigerian cannot afford. 

Don’t involve yourself in the kind of sport that rich people from proper societies amuse themselves with- 
“I like blue lingerie on a woman…” 
“No, red is sexier…” 

That’s the kind of debate you have when you insist on playing partisan. It is useless. You are in lack; what does it matter? Look beyond the symbols, look beyond what they want you to see. Analyse individuals.

We are focusing on witty attacks on social media? *smh* 

Your cool is poverty-stricken. Get real!

As long as we are yet to enjoy basic infrastructural courtesies, there’s just nothing that should make you act like you’z cool.

PS: I do hope Remi Sonaiya of KOWA finds acceptance into any government of the day, eventually.
