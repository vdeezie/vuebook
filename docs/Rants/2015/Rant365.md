This is what they do, they bring up a non-issue and blow it in our faces.

As commoners, we spend all of our energy and time- time we should use building substance, we waste on issues that bear no tag of true value to the overall advancement of self.

We waste too much time talking. Just talking. 

The Nigerian will talk from morning till night; it’s a sport that unfortunately isn’t going to make you one cent richer.

It’s a bait.

“Hello Brain, what are we going to do today?”

“Throw in controversy, Pinky. Let's send Nigerians on a wild-goose chase looking for my…errr…1977 primary school result. And let it be that I have only half the rights as a citizen until I find it.”

Then all Nigerians jump into some frenzy, analysing the subject that eats up your time and energy, drives your focus off the main issues.  

While you are all distracted, the real conspiracies continue from the back-end on tables plated with gold, amongst men who are richer than nations.

There’s a reason why you are the “masses”; this is the reason- you talk too damn much!

If your words cannot translate to pieces of writing that will influence Nigerians and/or pay your bills; then you are one of the major problems of progress.

Stop talking. If you have to tear an issue apart, can it not be torn in one sentence? 

You are too poor, too under-developed to spend too much time on Talk (unless you are running a Talk Show on TV... but you are not). 

Your status as the hottest shit in a group of noisemakers is the achievements of rodents.

You will not understand how useless 99% of Talk is, until you stop.
