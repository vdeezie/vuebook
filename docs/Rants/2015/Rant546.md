Tyler Perry continues to make us question his sanity with the kind of materials he churns out.

He has finally hit rock-bottom with his TV series, 'If Loving You is Wrong'

A woman is cheating on her (faithful) husband. 

Read the conversation:

Husband: You are cheating on me?

Wife: *sob *sob* y-y-yes

Husband: Do you love him?

Wife: *sob *sob* y-y-yes

Husband: Where do you make love?

Wife: *sob *sob* At his shed. 

Husband: Do you love making love to him more than you do me? (He is squeezing face now like he is attempting to be angry oh)

Wife: *sob *sob* Please sweetie, don't make me say these things... but...y-y-yes.

Husband: Do you use condoms with him?

Wife: *sob *sob* Oh dear. But...n-n-no

Husband: Are you pregnant for him?

Wife: *sob *sob* N-n-no. I have calculated the dates.

Finally, they will forgive each other and live happily ever after...with a Bible tucked under their arms.

The worst dialogue in all of eternity. 

Bad acting, shitty script, foolishness on a level that is unforgiving. 

Now a woman is crying that her grown up son cannot knot a tie. 

It's just a freaking tie for chrissake! 

Exaggeration that leaves you with a knife to your throat. 

Then there's the need for him to always try to fix the woman. The tough black woman needs a man to come into her life and make her see that life is so different and so beautiful... since she is suffering myopia nah.

Yes, fix the black woman, save her from her blackness and anger. 

It resonates across all his movies.

'If Loving You is Wrong' will not survive any kind of review. There'll be nothing left to hold on to after a critique is done.

It is appalling what this man is doing to Black Television, biko.
