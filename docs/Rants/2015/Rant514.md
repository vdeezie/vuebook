One of the most embarrassing turn for a writer is when you interview a celebrity, for instance, fluff over their personality like butter on bread, thinking this was easy…

Only for the celebrity to release a picture- or something- showing she was a survivor of breast cancer; or he had an accident as a child that kept him in igbobi for weeks…or lost the sight on his right eye as a teenager... and you didn't get that shit in your "viral" interview.

Ouch.

When the kind of information that should serve as the bedrock of the gist, slips out of your palms…

Because you are a Nigerian writer, always fluffing over everything.

"I so much admire so-and-so as he navigates through the business sphere of life making his imprint in the sands of time..."

Kill me now!

We like that kind of fart. While the real shit stays in the anus. Untouched.

Someone interviewed Joseph Benjamin, after reading the piece I said, "probably the whole conductor thing is trite?" 

"Huh? He was a conductor?!" writer did not know, after spending two hours with celeb. Information that sits on the internet like a hippo.

Three weeks ago I got two of my writers and our photographer to go to Abuja to cover the AY Live Show.

Their flight arrived a day before for the sole aim of building essential rapport with the crew and some of the acts; booked in a hotel for three days, with an impressive welfare package…

It was only natural that my expectations would be high.

When the report came in and the pictures followed, skeletal twitter presence and all that social media floss…

My expectations were not met.

-Because if I wanted the it-was-a-fabulous-event-and-an-amazing-line-up-of-celebs-and-MI-killed-it-and-princess-slaughterd-it kind of report…

Then all we needed to do was sit in the office and wait…wait…wait…

Until the pictures drop on the internet, then make stories from still shots.

You know whattamean?

Didn’t anyone throw in sexist jokes?

What about jokes that clearly show no empathy towards physically challenged people- the blind, the 'stammerer', the lame?

*sigh*

I stopped going to AY show after one lame joke. I know Nigerian comedians cannot survive without misogyny. Their vocabulary isn’t broad enough. They don’t read wide enough. 

The fact that moronic expressions and gestures and bad bad improvised acting is still a big part of their outing says a lot.

We need to start building this writing business like we mean business.

Break it hot. Break it bad.

Grab-your-knickers-everyone-bitch-has-something-to-say kind of reaction. 

Something like that.

Abuja is only so close to Amsterdam if your reviews can fly just as high.

I’m not making any sense. I should go to bed. 

Ps: I might change my mind in the morning and agree to all the boring uniformity.
