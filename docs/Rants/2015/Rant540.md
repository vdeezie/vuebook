What is the secret that has kept you married for 8 years?

Prayers. We remember to pray every morning and night. We carry the Bible teachings in our spirit as inspirational pointers to a successful union.

How did you succeed in business?

It is god. I follow the scripture, pray and fast and pay my tithe. 

What advice can you give on parenting?

Pray. Introduce your children to the prayerful life and ensure they follow the word. Then they shall continue to be the head and not the tail. 

How can we run a successful government?

Only god can decide that. It is god that can tell if one will succeed or not.

How can we end terrorism?

By prayers. We need to intercede for the land. We need to remember how Elijah prayed and the enemies scattered. 

How can we stop helicopters crashing into sea?

When was the last time we made sacrifice to the water goddess? With a few millions we can end deaths by offering goods to the spirit of the sea.

Why should a man be buried with a dead king?

Don't question it. It is culture. You too have your own culture. It has always been there and will always be there.

Ps: Who is mentoring your children? It is better (for them) to talk to stones everyday than be counselled by any on this list of losers.
