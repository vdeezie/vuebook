It is simple things, like ignoring that stupid grunt at the Airport announcing flights arrival and departure, that shows just how aloof we really are as a people.

It might seem like a simple matter, but that dreadful accent on bad speakers has been like that since I was 10!

We can live with almost any nonsense!

You fix your ears to the wall, you ask the person beside you- nobody understands jack what that voice is on about, yet it persists- decades in, decades out.

I can’t imagine how many people must have missed their flights because of that shitty accent on shitty device.

I hear #Zahra is still trending…

People are more interesting in lusting over a pretty girl than getting good service.

Twitter people, prove your platform is worth a little more than an orgy thrill, start a hashtag and demand they get good speakers and an audible NIGERIAN voice at the announcement booth at the Airport.

Na wa!
