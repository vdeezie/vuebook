Forgive me, I am about to go on and on about an issue that would most likely require a certain level of cultic obsession to comprehend.

Nonetheless let me proceed without a helmet.

If GEJ is handing over in a few days, why do we have staunch “Jonathanians” all over social media?

What is their quest? What is the objective? Where is the train heading to? Is there a destination?

As much as I have tried, I cannot comprehend average Nigerians who are head deep into politics on social media. We are far removed from the centre. Hopes of even getting drafted in are as slim as the camel-and-the-needle notion. So what really is the motivation behind the staunch support for a man who, by all standards, is run-of-the-mill?

If you disagree; and somewhere in your heart you believe GEJ was a remarkable president, beyond the fact that he allowed for a peaceful election, what are these remarkable events that happened in six years?

The best way to tell a working leadership is through the lives of the ordinary man on the street. So away from the bogus facts from Dr. Iweala’s desk, the nitty-gritty would be…

“Do you have power?” 
“Do you a health system that works?” 
“Is our education system better?” 

“No” still stands on all the issues we have suffered before Jonathan. Six years later, it’s still a big “No” to all the calamities plaguing us.

What then is this exemplary feat that you hold on to so dearly on social media about this man that you are willing to lose bond with almost anybody that opposes. And even suffer out of cyberspace?

I can’t, for the love of life, understand it. I know all about passion and surrendering oneself to a cause, but… why would any Nigerian, aware of the treacheries of politics surrender his/her peace of mind to upholding any politician in Nigeria?

Do you know how blissfully gratified these people are?

Look at Obasanjo, a total waste of space- he has found his mouth, after running a flawed and desperate regime. They come back in a different skin and continue their guiles.

Politicians have nine lives. You have one.

Why are you trading your widow’s mite for a plaster of cement on another man’s palace?

Would it be terrible if I say: Find a better cause to fight for? A more worthy pursuit? 

The GEJ groups springing up everywhere is mindless. The man is not going to be your president 9 days from today. What are you fighting for? 

Shouldn’t opposition concentrate on ensuring proper rule under the new leadership?

The hero worship of a man who barely survived the corruption afflicting its own house, is quite unsettling.

GEJ is no Malcolm X. He is no Gandhi. Can we give it a rest? 

I did campaign briefly for him during the elections, but that was a job. Strictly work. 

We need to know when to walk away before our sweat turns to blood…yet goes largely unrecognised or even chronicled.

I hear people are being harassed on FB and picked up by SSS… of course, freedom of speech trumps it all, but…

You are fighting for GEJ?

Seriously?

It looks more like an ego determined not to bow even after defeat.

He lost. Honourably.

Let it go.

And if at all we have to suffer persecution, let it be for something worthwhile.

Then again, who am I to decide what is worthwhile for the next person.

Carry on then.
