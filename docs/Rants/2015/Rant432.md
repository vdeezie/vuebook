Lagos is a beautiful state.

A day after elections you can hold a stage play and have all these wonderful people show up.

Today was fun.

Made quite a killing too! 

I wanted to take a picture of the wads like some insecure celebrity Instagram stunt, but it all couldn't fit into my mouth.

Anyway...

Thanks to Jimi Agbaje for accepting defeat and making that call and communicating peace and unity.

It's gonna a be a great week!

On to the next project.
