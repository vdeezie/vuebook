Today, I met a jolly taxi driver.

Our driver delayed (something about a/c blowing hot air), so we called a cab.

We got the sad news of an aunt's death in the car. High blood pressure. The gloom spread across our faces like a mask.

"It is better she is dead," cab driver said, almost to himself.

"Huh?"

"Let the dead die. It is better," he insisted with the broadest happiest face ever. 

A plump happy man saying the strangest things in a religious/pretentious society.

"My wife and I have HBP. Now she has stroke, shits on herself, and wishes to be dead. She is 48 years old. I take my own drugs everyday. CT scan costs N68,000. I'm just a taxi driver, and I have the children to take care of..." he shares this with a smile.

How does one smile through this kind of pain? I wonder.

"I asked that her mother come around to help...because I have to work. But her family tells me it is my responsibility- 'for better, for worse'. I sleep in my car, all my belongings in my booth...I bath at the corner of the taxi park...because, sometimes, this thing is hard to bear," he sighs.

Yet he remains one of the happiest persons I have encountered. That smile hides every pain.

At once I am grateful. 

When we are about to alight, I take a minute to adjust my dress at the backseat; my partner unaware I am still in the car walks one step away from the cab.

The taxi driver calls out to him...

"You don't leave a woman like this in the car, else I will wife her immediately."

And he laughed- the happiest laughter I have ever heard. His body dancing to the beat of the joy in his heart.

There's no price tag to this post. 

The nerve of me to ever be worried after this encounter.

There's no religion deeper that what that man lives.

Peace. Regardless.
