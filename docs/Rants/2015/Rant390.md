Successful Career Woman: Joy I need your advice urgently oh!

Me: What’s up, girl?

SCW: I am thinking of resigning from my job. It pays the bills but it has taken over my life

Me: Wow

SCW: I want to go back to my writing; and take it seriously. 

Me: My dear, please don’t resign. Writing will not pay your bills for, at least, 5 years. That’s a pretty long time to be broke.

SCW: Kai!

Me: And it will take over your life too- but this time, with piles of bills unattended 

SCW: I am frustrated oh

Me: I know. But you’ll be more frustrated as a newbie writer.

SCW: Hmmm

Me: BUT if you want to try it out in the storm, don’t let anyone stop you.

SCW: Oh dear!

Me: What you probably would need to do is start writing whether you have a day job or not; make it your escape. It will give you some type of joy and peace. Get your rhythm first before you step all out or push everything else aside.

SCW: I have a blog. I can turn the stories into a book

Me: What if it doesn't sell?

SCW: Joy, even if na N10k I make from my creativity...

Me: The thing is, I will not leave a high-flying job for a creative N10k thrill, but that's just me. Writing has to pay me damn good to get my attention... that's why it has all of my attention. But don't listen to me. We all have our unique stories. Let no one stop you!

SCW: I love you, this woman.

Me: I love you too!

*PS: Wherever you stand- top or bottom- life ain’t easy. If we can accept that, we’ve won half the battle.

I think.
