This is the part I detest…

"Toyin Lawani shades Tonto"

"Tonto claps back"

"Swanky Jerry (Tonto’s friend) throws shade at Lord Trigg (Toyin Lawani’s husband)"

"Lord Trigg’s responds, subbing him…"

Soon the whole family will enter the matter

Then you’ll hear that a dead cousin was exhumed to shade the other party

And the toddlers on each side of the favour-divide will be shading one another.

It’s silly. It's the stuff dead brains are made of.

When you are all done and exhausted playing with your toys, you will return to WORK.

How any kind of hate fest can last more than 24 hours is beyond logic.

They throw hate. You address it- address it WELL so you don’t ever have to come back to it. 

Then YOU MOVE ON!

Else you just become a nit-picking loser.

You gotta rise above mediocrity.

I had dinner once with someone who…

“X is just a horrible person,” she said

“How so?” I asked

“Just horrible sha. I don’t know. Just not really nice.”

“But she’s running a successful cab company on the Island. Brings up great ideas for her line of business (make up). Very entrepreneurial. Assists friends with job openings and has built a viable network system for almost everyone she knows. Never holds back info on a personal/business link that can help the next friend.”

“Yes. But she still got a lot of issues.”

“As I am sure you do too.”

“Huh?”

“You have decided to narrow in on X’s human flaws because you hate her…or just simply jealous, or moving with populist approach, either way I find you distatsteful.”

“No I AM NOT!” (yes she raised her voice at me. It was a restaurant, else I would have allowed her feel the high-pitch of my craziness)

“Yes, you are," I said. "How can you even fault X on any standard unless you are simply ignorant of her qualities or just mad that she is who she is?”

“So you want me to just fawn over her without saying her bad side.”

“It is not in your place to say her ‘bad side’ especially with this approach. This is called gossiping- the lowest form of communication. You are  not seeking help for X, you are not complaining about a specific issue she did that needs to be addressed, you are just talking so I can chip in a word and it can grow to fire that will quench your thirsty tongue.”

“Na wa oh! You are strange sha.”

“I know. I am not one of you.”

Dinner ended awkwardly. 

And the best part is: X is never going to hear about it- at least, not from me. 

They are still “good friends”- both of them.

Me? Ah! Let’s just say that the friendship didn’t take off eventually.

She is a big hater of Joy Republic now. Super big hater. There’s nothing she hasn’t said that she didn’t manage to colour with hate. And for good effect has managed to drag X to her side of skepticism. Heehee!

That is why the Bible says…

“Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you…”- Eccl 7:21

Tonto has her ears too close to the servant’s door. How come she still reads stuff off these people's IG?!!

Or maybe it’s the reverse. Whoever is bigger should claim the spot of the master and walk away from that door.
