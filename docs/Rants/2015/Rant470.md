I need an Assistant. 

It is a 9-5 job.

You have an office to report to.

I will not withhold your salary.

I pay way above minimum wage.

You will work. No excuses.

You will learn just by watching. 

My life is fast. You will catch-up. You'll find it exciting if you have any sense of adventure.

You will cringe at the opinions I throw around. Not directly at you. I will rattle every belief you have come to accept. 

Your boyfriend is not an asset. You will not use my time daydreaming about him. Or calling and chatting during office hours.

Your parents are none of my business. You are an adult. "My daddy says," should never happen. Ever. If they complain that you close late, tell them nobody who wants to succeed sleeps in 2015. But if you think I’m the wicked step-mother, then GO! 

Your pastor does not count at all! I don’t care about him. No, you cannot take Wednesdays off for Mid-week service.

I don’t suffer fools. I play a lot though. And you shall dine in some of the most exquisite locations; and meet remarkable people.

If you are anything close to a smart and independent person, we will take trips together; you will become a friend.

You will work weekends sometimes. I hold events during weekends. 

You must be female.

-Because I might want to work braless for a whole day and I don’t need to be self-conscious around anybody.

Educated. Smart. Attentive. Industrious. With a healthy interest in Media.
