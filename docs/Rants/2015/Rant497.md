I don't believe there's still the miracle of birth.

Every child that must be born, has been born. 

Every minister, every astronaut, every activist, every chef, every surgeon, every hit maker... is right here on earth.

We just need to fix our conscience to love and invest in children whether they be from our wombs or not.

There's no evidence of "God's love" when 60 year old women are having triplets in a world with cracks, begging for us to stop making more babies.

What kind of god encourages over population?

The ones that have been born, on the streets, who will take care of them?

If you don't, guess who is going to knock on your window in traffic in a few years' time with a machete. 

A driver's wife just gave birth this morning. 

"Well, you gotta work ten times harder now. Another mouth to feed," was what I said.

I was slightly irritated.

We fuck and we give birth. 

Where is god in all that moaning?

He was lamenting only a few days ago...

"No money sef to chop"

Yet another child is born.

And we must thank god.
