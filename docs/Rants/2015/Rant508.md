I like Oprah. She’s a ball of passion, and her approach to issues is vehement.

Oprah knows when to give in and let the other woman live her own damn life.

"It is not my job to change your life. Here are a few suggestions though, I stand by them without repentance, so…make your own decisions." 

That's the kind of vibe you get. That’s the total sum of Oprah as a TV brand.

But Iyanla is a different kettle of fish.

She has just as much passion, but clearly not as much desire to respect people’s decisions.

Iyanla is going to try to shake your issues out of you in a 30minutes show.

So your husband is beating you up?

Oprah will probably shrug and tell you that you can leave him and start something fulfilling…IF YOU LIKE.

Iyanla? She’s going to stomp all over your pain, shake your shoulders and tell you to leave this minute.

She leaves no room for you to even think!

So I was watching Oprah Life Class the other day, anchored by Oprah and Iyanla…
And there's a 19 year old black girl who says she’s never felt beautiful.

I can understand why- she is nothing close, not even remotely, to the stereotyped beauty the world loves to love.

Now, I would expect these women (Oprah and Iyanla) to just spell it out!

“Sweetie, you may not feel beautiful. But what does it matter? You can still be a lot of things- smart, cool, successful, intelligent, confident, honest, industrious, considerate…” 
Something like that.

But NO! Iyanla, especially, wants her to feel BEAUTIFUL right this minute! By fire, by force!
She calls on over 40 women to tell this girl she is beautiful; YET baby girl maintains she ain’t! LOL!

Now Iyanla’s ego is badly bruised. (How’s this little rat gonna make me look bad on TV?! I say you’z burriful, dammit!)

Ok. She didn’t say that though. But, you know, that’s Iynala and her own style of motivation.

Oprah, on the other hand, was getting really bored. (Let the girl feel ugly if she wanna. What does it matter?) I imagine the thoughts in her head.

My take is:

Let a 19 year old black girl feel whatever the hell she wants to feel. Physical issues should stop being a subject women spend hours talking about and feeling sorry.
Men don’t gather together to talk about lack of six-packs, ugly foreheads and small penises; feeling sorry for themselves and crying for hours, do they?

We don’t bring up boys feeling insecure about any part of their bodies, even their yams legs. So why do we think it is acceptable to spend a whole hour on TV talking about black women’s physical insecurities?

With an hour on TV, men will build a new method to generating power to Africa; while women will still be sobbing over having a flat nose or small breasts.

I know someone who married the first man who told her she was beautiful. She said not even her mother ever called her beautiful. 

So "Mr." gotta stay for seeing something nobody else ever saw in her. He knew how much she needed to hear it, so he said it every single time: "You are beautiful."
.
Now settled in marriage, he slams eba at the back of her head. 

Physical insecurity is a bitch.

Dear 19-year-old-black-girls, feel ugly. Heck, feel whatever you want to feel. Your ugly feelings are just as valid as the beautiful ones.

Succeed anyway.

Succeed, regardless of how ugly or pretty you (want to) feel.
