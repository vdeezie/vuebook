# Rant489


May 30, 2014

Sigh. Too many teenagers reaching out to me these days.

What can I tell you? I think you should focus on people like Chimamanda or someone with finer words.

I’m just full of fucks.

I have no plans of letting it go, I find it liberating.

What advice can I give you?

In my 20s I was a very good girl. Oh dear! I was good. There were no doubts about my goodness.

I didn’t drink. I didn’t smoke. I didn’t party. I didn’t move around with boys. 

I didn’t live.

I quickly ran into a church and served as much as I could, with the talents I had.

I said the right things. Did the right things. Pleased all. I sat and allowed myself to be schooled by patriarchy and religion. I was humble...or at least I tried.

I was not troublesome. I was very normal. Very sane. Very nice.

I wanted what everyone wanted. A marriage. A few kids. My rightful place as a submissive somebody.

Yet nothing happened. With all my niceness, I had no valuable friendships- just too many friends contributing nada to my life. I had no money. I was heading nowhere.

So I got tired.

I got tired of being someone else.

THIS is who I am- this chaos you see on Facebook is me.

This is who I should have been since I was 21. I wasted those years thinking if I was nicer or sweet or lovely…I would have more.

But you can’t have anything if you don’t live in your truth.

You can’t discover purpose if you don’t first discover yourself.

I found me.

With my loud voice, passion spilling over, highly opinionated rants… I found me. And surprisingly, I found my kind. I found comfort. 

Every rant I post is an extra day added to my life.

So far, I shall live another 489 days more from the date of my death. That is how much my rants have saved me.

Do not try to be like anyone else. Be you.

Do not waste your younger years trying to fit in with society. Everyone is trying to do that. Please don’t.

If you discover yourself early enough, it would save you years of pretentious relationships. You would naturally attract your kind. That will save you years of wasted efforts. 

The opportunities I have now are breaks that came with a full knowing of my true person.

I didn’t have to pretend to get sponsorship for #TheConversation 
I didn’t have to be sweet to get Nasco sign me up 
I didn’t have to be someone else to get leeway to running the Happenings brand.

And many more.

They met me like this. All of them read my Facebook rant.

They accept me and my madness.

That is the most beautiful thing that can happen to anyone. To be accepted not just in words, but in worth by people who truly matter.

These are my best years. My insane years are the years of my birth. I was born a full grown woman in my 30s.

You don’t have to wait that long. 

Even if it doesn’t pay off immediately. There’s no truer way to live than as YOU.

So, dear teenager...

Don't try to be nasty. Don't try to be nice. Don't try to quote scriptures. Don't try to use 'fucks'. 

Don't Try.

Don't be anything that isn't You.
