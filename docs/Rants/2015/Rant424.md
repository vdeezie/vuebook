So the margins were close at the last election. It shows that Lagos is tired of APC. Festac town voted massively for Jonathan. They say Festac is made up of Igbos boys. Now they are threatening to throw all of them in the Lagoon.

Unless you are being fed from the coffers of a political party… A position that requires a salary or massive corruption or contracts or any fancy name you give the chop-I-chop syndrome that fattens the pig…

My fellow Nigerians, it is better to be non-partisan.

Why you would want to spend the next 4 years apologising or defending all the blunders that are set to happen is something that I can never understand.

You have your hustle; face your daily bread, stop this partisan loyalty that makes your brain seem like a tuber of yam.

I insist that it is cultic for anyone to stand so firmly behind a politician and defend actions or promises yet to be fulfilled, unless it is his job to do so.

The rest of you, what is your duty? Don’t do this to yourself.

It is shameful.

The Oba said the shit he said.

So after blaming Jimi Agbaje, cursing PDP, and mocking GEJ for something a bloody Oba actually said… 

How do you feel now?

People are even tuning to TVC to get the “true story”

Biko, who owns TVC? Think! Or are you brainless?

Some people were even trying to give us the connotative meaning of “Lagoon”

Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. 

Don’t you feel a fuck stupid?

*sigh*

Stop defending politicians like a rat whose tail is stuck under the bed.

Be a man/woman. Stand for one thing- truth and progress. Let that be all that matters.

You are usually fast asleep when these politicians make decisions on their midnight tables, so how do you wake up the next day and put yourself in front of the bullet? Pledging loyalty to a party that you have only the same privileges like I do- from outside the window.

Knock your head. Get a brain.

Be the opposition. That is the position a citizen must acquire. It is a very powerful position. Anything else is ass-licking.

This is the season of Saul. You need all the strength you can muster to continue this Voltron work you have assigned yourselves with no pay.

You will defend and defend and apologise and fight people… for what? For politicians? What a waste!

I care about Nigeria because my children live here. 

If it was just me, I will travel all over the world with my lover- NewYork, Funchal, Buenos Airies, Stockholm, Sweden, Vancouver, Paris, Rome, Istanbul…

Dump his ass halfway if he annoys me and explore the world on my terms.

But I am here, so I plan to use my brain not my heart when I analyse the shit these politicians and their desperate allies are made of.
