We are first human beings before we are tailors, engineers, pastors, bricklayers, architects, sick, angry, happy, in love, tired, wealthy.

First, we are humans.

When you go to bed with ten thousand generator thuds and bangs attacking your peace; wake up with a pool of sweat on your bed; start a routine by 4am that would require the flashlight from your phone or dull light from an old lantern to see your way through your own home…

Are you being treated as human?

When you get into traffic by 5.30am, caused by craters and potholes the size of Fayose’s stupidity… greeted by a new set of generator clatters and vibrations at the office; drenched to your pants in sweat before noon and still expected to miraculously perform and deliver excellent work.

You are not being treated as a human being.

When your car is stolen, no authorities you can turn to- equipped enough to fight for you. If, unfortunately, cancer or diabetes knocks at your door; you’ll have to let it in, give it a comfy seat and then go pick a spot at the graveyard and the kind of polish you want on your coffin…

You will not survive any illness in Nigeria, apart from a headache. Children are still dying of malaria- a country of this magnitude with oil money dripping from the anus of a few. You will die like a rat or find your way to India or Israel- money spent on health trips that leaves your whole family poor.

You are not a human being. A dog in America has a better chance at life than you.

There they are in their gutted triumph, projected from tinted glasses specially made to keep many yards away from your simplicity caused by their gluttony.

You know, I am sick of affection and the contempt it brings. There’s got to be a limit to human scorn and disrespect. I suddenly realize how much bullshit we accept.

It is the reason I hate twitter so badly. I don’t see people treated as human beings.
It makes no sense to spend time with someone and then build contemptuous tweets around them the minute they look the other way. There’s just so much contempt even amongst average people. Such disgraceful immaturity and tomfoolery. Where are your limits?

But I deviate.

This post is about something bigger, something utterly sad.

Nigeria is yet to understand that I do not need love, or promises or prayers.
I need to be treated like a human being. That means, I wake up to a running tap, to electricity to preserve my chicken in the fridge… I have an operative number to call when a house is on fire, and believe beyond doubt that there is water in that Fire Service tank when it appears. 

To call the Police when I hear a neighbour beating his wife, or a madam about to kill her housemaid- and they show up, interrogate and make necessary arrests.

I want to be able to get educated in my own country; why go to Ghana? Why get a degree in Cameroon?

I want a disciplinary committee to take my matter seriously when a lecturer puts his hand under my skirt. I want to be able to charge the state and get justice when my friend dies on Lagos/Ibadan expressway because the roads are filled with granite and left to deteriorate every other month to deadly hollows.

We ask for basic needs, basic attention. Things human beings require.

Stop with the preaching of love and harmony or even integrity; because when you treat the next person like a human being you wouldn’t need a spreadsheet to list out each virtue you think they deserve.

At the height of blatant thievery and corruption, the masses are but a pack of termites. Look at all those heads popping out of party rallies- of hungry masses, searching for basic human needs; when one politician will have the kind of money that is equal, in shame, to the glaring poverty and desperation of his people.

They are not statistics or data for your vain glory; they are human beings with needs and hopes- of education, of employment, of opportunities; praying that someone sees them and treats them like, yes, human beings.
