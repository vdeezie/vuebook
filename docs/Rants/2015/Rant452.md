Fast and Furious 7 is like a kid trashing a grocery store without a single bruise or twitch  or consequence...

The loud noise of Bournvita tins and crashing sounds of strawberry jam containers.

He wrecks the store.

But then his mother shows up and kisses his head.

"I love you, son"

He is suffering from some disease that makes him a trashing kid. 

Trashikiloid unteriasis. 

Then it all makes sense. You sigh and shed a tear.
