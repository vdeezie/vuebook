“Why do you always defend women? Would it mean that women are never wrong?”

Ok.

It would seem I defend women when plain humdrum social media frenzied issues come up. 

If you can manage to string assumptions together and have a bunch of people on your side who see life from a similar angle, and you attended a secondary school, you can start an attack and be able to sustain it for as long as your unremarkable existence can allow. 

That said, it is easy for women's issues to degenerate to sex-hate, body-shame paroxysms.

“Ashewo” sits on the tongue of many (male and female), waiting to find expression anytime a woman is in the dock. Ironically, it is women who would run this hate movement- women with vaginas that have been smashed continuously for years, addressing another woman as a “whore”.

Shit confuses me. 

Before long, a matter loses substance and the very exciting trade of female-bashing which comprises how she fucks men, who she is fucking, the size of her breasts, the shape of her ass, what men think about her sex appeal, what others think about her beauty or lack of it, who she is fighting and what that fight would mean to her over all happiness and sexual fulfilment... *whew*

You know, a tirade of debauchery takes over. Perversion triumphs, and people become as Xenophobic as South Africans, here on the internet.

I can’t stand it. So I will cover the woman from the attacks until attackers need to go and tickle off the overload of cum in their labia (or wherever that shit is stored).

Men do not suffer this malignant tumour. When a man is attacked, there are no stray areas to hurt him. If he is a thief, the subject remains the same- he is a thief. And discussion will revolve around that subject.

But if it is a woman…

Women are like Blacks. The world is against us, and we are against ourselves. We are fighting for something; only problem is we do not want the next woman to have it. So instead, we endure patriarchy. 

“Better to stay as we are- run by men, than let a woman have a shot at this…” says the little devil on your shoulder.

The saccharine craving to hurt or kill the morale of the next woman is something I can never comprehend.

I fight these situations knowing I am the underdog. As long as I do not have to be one of you sha, I am fine.
