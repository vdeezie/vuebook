I remember the last #TheConversation on Child Rape that we held at Oriental Hotel...

There was a last minute suggestion by my assistant to invite one dude, barely a week to D-day, to add his voice to the campaign. 

I hear he is passionate about children and sexual molestation. So I reached out to him. He was excited and asked that I send a mail.

I did. I also attached the eflier with a hope-you-can-join-your-voice-with-ours-on-d-day mail.

His response came a few minutes later. 

He was not happy to be told to come to an event to speak on Child Rape without his name on the flier.

He would need over 30 minutes to enunciate his points.

He would appreciate proper recognition during the event as he has spent years being an advocate of child rape victims. 

Is it not possible to edit the entire programme to include him as a special guest?

The demands were endless. You would think I was organising a Champagne party. 

I did not respond. I blocked him immediately. And told my assistant never to pick his call again.

Nigerians are self-entitled nonentities.

We are talking about Child Rape here; children are being abused sexually by the people in their lives. YET a fucking Nigerian wants me to roll out a red carpet to welcome him to the event.

We are the worst kind.

This brings me to other matters...

I paid my way to Ake Festival this year.  When I called Seun, the admin head, I asked for hotel rates, I wanted the closest place to the venue.

It was Radisson Hotel. It was expensive she warned. But I wanted to be there.

I took care of my bills. Hotel, food, and didn't even bother about the after-party. I had dinner that night alone in my room, kissing all the books I had bought.

I was invited for the first Ake as a guest by Lola. That was after she had reached out to me a couple of times to come to Abuja for book readings under her literary organisation. Twice she called, texted to fly me to Abuja to read. I couldn't honour any of the invitations then.

I hadn't yet found myself. I didn't think I had anything to contribute. 

When I had come into my own being, this year, I carried myself there, and took care of myself. For myself. 

Stop telling people how to run their own ideas. If it doesn't fit your requirements, start your own damn project. Get your own firsthand experience; see how "easy" it is to gather people for even a cup of coffee!

People who have criticised feminism, for instance, all year round cannot successfully bring together 5 people if they dared to start an event.

It's the same attitude we have for everything. 

We wait for someone to start our dream...then we try to teach them how to do it.

If you don't like how it's done, and it is not done with your tax money...why don't you just find a way to fit in...

Or be quiet?
