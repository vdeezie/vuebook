My daughter picked Queen's College as first choice. 

I shook my head and made her change it to second choice  (or no choice at all).

She's been sulking all evening. 

That is her wahala. 

"You will go to a mixed school. You will meet boys. They will stare at your breasts, spend ridiculous hours analysing your buttocks when you walk by. One will steal a kiss and run off, another would write a silly love letter; they will steal money from their mother's purses to buy you gifts..." I said to her.

"You'll meet really nasty ones with foul words. You will report to teachers the idiotic methods they use to get your attention or piss you off until you get tired of reporting to authority. They would propose sex, and you will slap anyone who tries to place a mirror under your skirt.

"You will deal with all the nonsense of the opposite sex; it will exhaust you and that's fine. That is life.

"Why distort life's realities with an all-girl experience? Are there only women in the world? 

"You are going to spend a large chunk of your 20s thinking about the opposite sex anyways, so why pretend they don't exist? You need to start learning how to deal with that shit now, so you know how to put it in it's place."

She looked at me like I just lost all my hair- with paralysing shock. 

Ironically, we all had bananas after dinner.
