Every time I received my daughter’s report card (the younger one), there was always that ambiguous word in red that left me troubled.

They write it in red so it stands out of all the blue and black; like a proud word (the irony) waiting to be embraced.

“Jolade is a gentle and HUMBLE girl”

Humble.

What is that?

Does it mean when a classmate throws the cover of a biro at her, she doesn’t react?

Is she the type to surrender her only pen because a colleague asked for it, and then stares at the board helplessly waiting for the pen to be returned at the convenience of the recipient?

Would she allow a mate hit her head and when it hurts, will choke on her tears and do or say nothing.  

Is she the type to be intimidated and easily manipulated by friends?

Is she too afraid to confront her peers?

Is she desperate for affection; eager to please; wanting to be made whole by friends?

What is this “humble” always sitting in her report card?

I detested it, but of course I would hug her and flip the sheet fast to the more important things- her scores for the term.

Yet it worried me; I don’t want a humble daughter at 7! Too early to be burdened with the need to satisfy an insatiable world and be left guilt-ridden.

Ha! No, please God.

So I started listening to things unsaid- between her utterances.

“How was school today?” I would ask

“Fine, mummy.”

“Anything spectacular happened?”

“Well, yes. I lost my pen.”

(Spectacular, indeed)

She lost her pen every other day. So with this “humble” report, I concluded her pen was being yanked from her, and because she is “humble” and mummy is the richest negro in town, after Dangote, she would always get another one.

Also, her bottle of water- the one I pay for that is given to her along with her lunch in school... it’s usually a thing of status to pay that extra money to be fed by the school during break hours (and boy! The food tastes delicious!), but sincerely I do it out of convenience.

I realised she gave freely her juice and fruits and bottled water that came with her meal; and I was certain she did it out of coercion.

She would receive worn items- like damaged pens and toys, in exchange for her fancy toys and chic writing tools.

Now that I understood this “humility”, I resented it even more.

So I started the guerrilla drill… 

One day I picked her up from school, her humble ass sitting in my car, looking morose.

“What is that long face?”

“Nothing”

“Anything spectacular happened?”

“Fredrick (not real name) was throwing his pen on my head and disturbing me.”

(and guess what? She would RETURN the pen and the dude will do it all over again! Imagine that! My OWN daughter!!!)

Now I was fuming...

“Well, the next time he throws a pen at you, turn around and throw that damn pen on his head! And if anyone talks shit to you, look them in the eyeball and talk shit back to them. Do not cower, do not shrink; you stand tall and you fight back. You always fight back unless you are dealing with an ant…and you will meet plenty ants not worth responding or fighting…you don’t expend energy on a fucking ant, you crush the fucking ant!”

I was driving and swearing and losing my hair.

“Mum!” My older daughter sliced into my anger.

“This is serious,” she held this mock expression. “You are swearing in front of us!”

“Sorry,” I grumbled.

Then she turned to her younger sister and said, “When they throw a pen at you, go to the window and fling it outside- far away. Soon they’d have no more pens to throw again.”

Well, that’s one way to deal with it.

Anything but “humble”.

Anything.
