I just read this on Twitter:

"I heard a woman tell a pastor that she doesn't wash her husband's clothes because her husband doesn't wash hers...she is going to bring up her daughter just like this...I am sorry for the demons some men get married to."

The handle belongs to a woman.

It is important we put this message out there:

I paid over a quarter of a million as basic school fees for ONE child to get an education this new term. Text books are not included in this fees. Transportation is not part of it. It is not a boarding fee. It is basic school fees. I still had to pay a different sum for books, leisure etc.

One child.

Now double that sum. Coveniently you have over half a million for basics.

My children are girls. 

The idea of working so hard so I can get my children the very best that I can offer; the best facilities I can find in a Nigerian school, the best care, the best one-on-one attention... is not because I don't like to travel to fancy places all over the world.

If I take them a step down this comfort level, I know how many countries I will be able to visit every other month. 

I refuse to. 

My reward will not be that I will eventually groom daughters who will be influenced and defined by a society that believes their ability or desire to wash a man's clothes is greater than any ambition. 

These conversations on social media irks me to no end!

I am not educating my daughters to be wives. 
If all they will be judged by at the end of the day is their need to wash a husband's clothes, and be termed "demons" for not having that natural obsession to be submissive to the man...

Then my money is wasted, my time, all the new knowledge I put on the table in my house would be wasted.

The example I lay for them to see - as a mother who strives for whatever she wants, and gets it, regardless of the hurdles...

All of that would be wasted if all they need to be is a washing wife, occupying a subservient position in life.

Nigerian women, how do you "feel sorry for the wives some men end up with" just because she insists dude should wash his own clothes?

What's your business? How does it concern you what rules/roles obtain in another's marriage?

Will you like to apply as the bloody washerman of the household and spare us your judgmental/pious position fueled by stark and confounding ignorance?

At least our "fore fathers" were not hypocrites. If the girl child is going to end up in a man's house and all she ever needs to worry about is taking care of his mess and abiding to home rules and obeying leftover decisions...

They didn't bother to educate her. 

Alas, in 2015 we are educating girls, but deep down we still want them to be identified solely on their ability to be submissive wives who love the smell of dirty socks and like to scrub tiles.

Please ehn social media, don't irritate me this morning.
