Kim publishes hundreds of selfies...

American reviewers want to make a cerebral discourse out of it. Using adjectives that exaggerate the reality star's ambition.

Now Kim is a phenomenon of sort?

We are all ass-lickers in this world.

As in... people sit around to discuss the "Prevalence of helminthic fauna in Mrs. West in comparison with the wild insatiable quests for substance."

I swear, I don't even understand what I just wrote. But that is how this whole idea of giving substance to Kim's book of selfies by cerebral writers sounds.

Leave the lifestyle glossy magazines to review that shit abeg. At least we are honest enough to know it is a vain project and focus on her next botox.

But when writers from a different genre start to make an intellectual series of it. It's just a waste of life.

Complete balderdash. Tongue too deep into that anus. 

Kim is Kim- big booty, fine face, tiny voice, expressionless- lest she breaks out with a disease like, say, wrinkles.

That's all.

You can't convince me killing a Malian on the dark streets of Pretoria is not Xenophobia (just a bunch of poor angry lazy South Africans messing around) and then try to convince me there's a scientific approach to Kim Kardashian's book.

Stop. Please.

I have a headache.
