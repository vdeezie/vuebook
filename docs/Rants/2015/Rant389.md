I think the real heroes of any movement are those who choose to be part of it, for the sake of humanity.

When white people join in black protests to fight against racism, the real heroes are those whites. I think.

If the huts and kiosks housing families in Makoko are destroyed by flood, for instance, the woman living in Lekki who decides to drive out of her grandiose living to the slum to protest, along with impoverished families, to ensure government establishes that unit with good housing…

That woman is the real hero in this situation.

-Because she could well be at home, preparing for dinner, dressed in silk for the night, entertained by Reality TV.

Minorities and the poor can raise one voice to fight for a better life for their kind…after all, you'll be fighting for your own needs.

But if they are not your “kind” (whatever that means) and you still march on...

That’s heroic.

Isn't it?

Imagine you who can afford to pay N500k school fees for your kid, filing out with “poor people”, insisting the government introduces lunch to public schools because these (poor) kids don’t eat well at home.

You may not understand the situation that would ever make a child starve, you work damn hard and your kids have everything; but humanity speaks to your conscience and you become part of a reality you don't belong in.

You’z the hero.
