There are many reasons we stay underdeveloped.

THIS is one…

Mark Zuckerberg, oga of Facebook ville, posted a laudatory message to his wife, Priscilla Chan, on her amazing achievements as an award-winning paediatrician, working with underserved families in local schools, and joining efforts with him in education and health philanthropy:

“I'm so proud of Priscilla Chan for all the good she does in the world,” he said, with a picture of her.

Then a Nigerian male shows up on the thread with this oh-so amazing comment:

“The girl nor fine sef…”

We suffer a mental defect. There's no other explanation to give for this type of idiocy.

We put the swagz in stupidity.
