So...

Rita, Majek Fashek's ex-wife, addressed the issue of her marriage to the musician.

30 years, only 6 years of their union was recorded as bliss.

24 years of loneliness and despair; left to raise three children on her own as husband battled with drug addiction. 

She was there when he came back drunk and stoned, and when he didn't come back at all.

When he returned to Nigeria. She stayed back to care for the family.

24 years dedicated to faith and hope that a man's dignity will be restored. 

She finally left the marriage, but not the man. Even in a new home with another man, she's still looking for ways to help Majek.

Yet a Nigerian desecrates that post with a Nigerian response:

"You should persevere. Don't give up. You enjoyed him when he had everything, you should stay when he has lost all."

Apparently, 24 years is not enough time to prove you are not a gold digger. 

If it was a woman dead on drugs, would you ask that the man perseveres longer than a minute?

It's probably the air we breathe. All the fumes from generators messing with common sense.

Or all that ponmo we eat. Tough dirty leather.

We are not sane people by any measure.
