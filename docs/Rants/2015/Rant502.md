Uuugh! You people are killing me!

Please stop with all this patriarchal mess!

When a man reaches out to a female Facebook friend in regards to a tagged post and a familiar name that reminds him of tickly groin and goes ahead to pour out a load of cum on an Ex via inbox...

It has NOTHING to do with the female.

Jeez!

Stop going on and on about how he wants to get down with the woman...

May be it is how you write or how you dress or how you laugh or the colour of your eyes...

Stop!

Just stop. 

That is you being as guilty of any patriarchal judgment that exists that we stand against.

A man's need to share sexual exploits has nothing to do with anything- not the weather, not the alcohol in front of him, and definitely not any woman! 

He is simply a Fuckboy. Period.

Stop making excuses for men!!!

Gosh. 

He is a fuckboy; and he will share this tale with a dead chicken on the road if he can.

That's what fuckboys do. Think!

Don't start any scientific thesis around the intentions of a mere male. 

I'm sure even men are amused by how much thought  women give to the lousy actions of a mere human being with a dick.

Why do we let patriarchy build such monstrous castles on our heads?!

There is no reason why men do what they do. They do what they do because they want to do it. 

Girls get raped because rapists want to do it. It has nothing to do with the bra strap peeping out of her blouse.

Fuckboy status is all the reason to kiss-and-tell.

Sometimes they meet total strangers at bars and share their sexcapades.

We continue to make princes out of paupers by wasting too much time analysing their motives. 

It's a mess when we cannot see how much patriarchy continues to work on our sense of judgement.

This unlearning business is real yo!

We all need to unlearn our shit abeg!
