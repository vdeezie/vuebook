I buy her N3k pizza…for night I comot all my money for the girl bodi sha…

That’s from rapper, A-Q’s latest track titled #sugabelly

Yes, you heard right. Sugabelly is the title of the track. 

It’s a song about a girl who lies for a living.
 
I school in London and live in Dubai. I take the flight everyday from Dubai to London…We have an oil well at our backyard so we don’t need to buy fuel for our cars and generator…

You know, elementary skits like that.

I really don’t care what he calls the song.

But I have a problem with that line about Pizza.

We can’t continue to find humour in the Mr-Biggs-meatpie-and-sex-in-return script.

This shit is demeaning as hell.

There’s got to be a way we can inform girls and women to seek out their own financial salvation. 

Don’t go into a relationship with the idea that it is your partner’s duty to take care of you. You are an adult, you should take care of YOU.

Or at best, take care of each other. Support each other.

It is a script fine-tuned by religion.

Help meet.

What does that suggest?

You are at the receiving end of a man’s generosity and/or frugality.

So when a man is down, you are down. Because you are help meet.

And if he feels the need to blame you for his failure, he can…and his claims will hold credence in religious/cultural/social circles.

Why?

We are full human beings. Why should women be at the mercy of men?

We need to change this narrative.

People speak to young girls and advise them to strive to become - wait for it - the wife of a President. Or wife to a very important man.

What about just telling them to be presidents and important women.

We feed teenage girls with this script of striving to become accessories to a ‘great man’… be positioned for the love and sympathy of a man.

One man.

Just one man.

Very annoying ambition.

Women are dying in abusive unions because of ONE man. Resigning from work because ONE husband said so. Living below poverty line because ONE man cannot make enough money for both of them and four children. 

These extremely poor choices.

It starts with this type of thinking…

“I buy her pizza, so I need to fuck that N3k out of her before she goes home. ‘gotta count my losses and gains.”

That was how one idiot came on Facebook to rant about a girl who wanted to meet with him at Mr. Biggs... instead of meeting at a buka.

A penniless nobody!

The audacity of the average Nigerian male!

Women, change this narrative. Its really in our hands.

Teach your girl child to pay for her own damn pizza.

And while you are at it, tell her it is not cool to buy her own shawarma and still get treated as poorly as the roll of cabbage and beef by a so-called boyfriend at the back of a Mercedes.

Don't stifle the next generation with your Stockholm syndrome bull crap. They can walk away.

Tell them it is perfectly OK to walk away- from stale pizza, from beefy shawarma... from meatpie-for-sex fellas.

Uuugh!
