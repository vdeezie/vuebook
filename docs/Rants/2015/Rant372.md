# Rant372


February 1, 2015

Yesterday, I was at Mirian Chibuzor Azubuike’s book reading. As busy as my day was, I squeezed the hour to be there because I wanted a different discussion. In the last month, I have developed an interest in Nigerian politics, and with it comes anger that I can taste on my tongue.

I have hated this country so much that there is no more hate left in me. I now have to fill the emptiness with curious discussions and angry questions.

Why is Nigeria the way it is?

Mirian wrote a book about building the first borehole in a rural settlement in Bauchi. 'The Girl Who Found Water' chronicles Mirian’s NYSC experience, and how she immortalized her name in a community of 6,000 indigenes living with only a stream that dries up during harmattan and unsuitable for drinking all year round. A community with zero amenities or infrastructure. A dead district with dead dreams.

The discussion focused on Community Service. This time we are not talking about sex and love and fuck. Thanks to Mirian.

However, like every Nigerian dialogue, I was pissed off before the event even kicked off. First with the National Anthem I am made to recite, then the MC had the audacity to tell us to celebrate Nigeria by shouting ‘hurray’ three times and then went on to proclaim Nigeria a great country.

There are 6,000 people living in some dead area in Bauchi without water, without roads, without education, and we think it is cool to celebrate Nigeria in a hall tucked somewhere on the Island?

You see why we prefer writing about sex? At least there are no obvious pretentions about what your vagina or penis desire.

Community service is an exercise from the heart, and that makes it a hard topic to shred into meaning. It holds value beyond intellectual discourse. 

But I pride more on what is in my head than any residue of blab in my heart, and that was why I stood out like a sore thumb at the event.

They probably thought I was too passionate, too opinionated…if only they knew I didn’t even get to say half of what I really wanted to say. I choked on half the words with tears in my heart.

Why should it take one corp member to solve a simple issue as water in a community under a state like Nigeria with politicians richer than countries?

Why are we celebrating ‘little deeds’ when we can demand that the right things be done from these fuckers holding our country at ransom?

We are not having the right discussion.

The responsibility to provide water, good roads, electricity, facilities to empower the citizens is not the job of the ‘average Nigerian’ (for lack of a better word)- it is the job of those elected into power; those selected to manage our oil; those who make financial/economic decisions based on our taxes.

Like I said yesterday, “Mirian it is not your job to provide water for 6,000 people in Bauchi.” 

But you did; and as someone said, "God led you". For that, I celebrate you!

Now that the point is made, let’s focus on the REAL issue:

Do it the Martin Luther King way- Shame the devils by exposing these communities, coming together with ONE voice and speaking against the deplorable state of our nation.

But that is never going to happen, because people like me are seen as quarrelsome and demanding, and the rest are seen as sweet and helpful.

I am sorry, but we are NEVER going to enjoy anything close to a civilised society if we continue to alienate government from our personal struggles and communal failures. THEY PUT YOU IN THIS MESS, go and confront them. They are accountable to us. Stop selling this idea that we can survive away from the political authority. No society can function without reformed politics, inclusive government. Anything else is superficial like the tiara and eyelashes of a beauty queen.

My secondary school used to have a Library with books stocked from top floor to bottom. I was the library prefect, and it was my haven. Fast-forward to 2015, I see a Facebook group soliciting for ex-students to contribute to restore the glory of the Library. There’s not one book left. Not one. LASMOCK library is now like a hall set to entertain fucking lovebirds trying to tie a fucking knot (the only activity we know how to do aggressively in this third-world hell).

And I made my point very clear: Before you start to gather your peanuts to build a library that will probably degenerate to dust again in a few years; let us write a letter to the authorities in government responsible for this school (it is a Lagos State College), stubbornly involve them in the process, ask questions and demand reason and action.

Laugh if you want, but our need to live like there’s no government in this country is what keeps this raving lunatic-of-a-‘husband’ fucking every ‘Thot’ from the anus.

Demand to be treated right. When we gather to celebrate tiny pieces of glory that should be done through the right channel, we condone their lax and it turns out looking like a pity party.

If you don’t know, Nigeria is broke. All your oil money and tax is stashed in individual bank accounts. And it has very little to do with this present administration. Our apathy has brought us to this point where we can’t even trace billions of naira that should provide basic things like WATER for all Nigerians.

We are a lazy people. We can carry ‘ponpon’ until the sun fries our skin crisp brown; we can run into hundred meetings a day; but we are mentally indolent. The worst of us are rented like thugs for partisan glory, spewing vitriol in support of their political choice on social media. 

Shame on us all!

But I am a party pooper. Don't let me spoil y'all Nigerian party.

To Mirian, well done. You did well.
