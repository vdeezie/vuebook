Compromises are patronising.

Talent compromise is pathetic.

Negotiations on what you want to be and what is available is as bad as bending over for quick sex so you don’t have to pay for a new set of wares you got from Balogun market.

Compromises should be subtle. It’s too much to ask people to turn their lives around just because they need to feed.

I like to write. I like to write from the comfort of a swivel chair with a gold watch on my wrist, making crum-crum sounds against my laptop; keying in letters I am proud to be associated with.

Words created on my terms.

I will never do copy-and-paste gossip. Again.

Never again.

I do not care about Nicki Minaj’s butt. 
I don’t care what Omotola is wearing beyond a glimpse of a picture on BellaNaija. 
I want to know who Amber Rose is fucking, of course, but I do not wish to write a thesis on it.

I do not wish to be so desperate for pop culture that I actually think Kim Kardashian has some wit about her book or her brand that I need to form effusive sentences around something that is clearly boobs-and-ass-and-Kanye.

Ratchet TV and all its reckless stars who would pierce an eye pupil and fix a ring in it just to have that five minutes of fame is not my cup of tea. I don’t want to analyse their sorry desperate lives.

I did that shit for three months… and for those three months I looked in the mirror and said this isn’t me.

This is not where I want to be. What is this?

You lose sleep, just so you can be the first to break the news that Davido is actually sleeping with that woman and not the other woman.

I remember when my older brother graduated many years ago and was dropping his CV in every well-established corporate office…

He got an offer, one day, from an uncle who introduced him to Clearing and Forwarding.

My brother made quite a killing in the business, but he left a few months later, back to the house, trying to follow up with his CVs and corporate interviews.

That compromise was just not what he was ready to make.

He wanted to work as a corporate executive. And not even the money from C&F was good enough negotiations for his aspirations.

He did finally get to work in many corporate offices and now runs a successful company that occupies a duplex and company cars for top executives in his payroll.

These days, there are no lines anymore- you are either hustling aimlessly or you are a lazy skunk.

It’s the same struggle for writers, because there is evidence (a la Linda Ikeji) of a killing in the copy-and-paste industry of gossip reportage. 

Err… don’t do it if you cannot stand the frivolity of that genre.

Do you know you can feel like a big loser if Kourtney Kardashian gives birth to her 100th baby by 1:45am, for instance, and you couldn’t get up to blog about it immediately TMZ carried it?

You wake up by 7am to find out everyone has giraffed the answer before you. And you feel helpless all day.

Is that life?

What kind of writing career is that?

See ehn, the only millionaires in gossip writing in Nigeria have already been made. 

Linda can probably afford a jet. That’s as good as it can get. What other record do you want to break? Hustle for her crumbs?

All the other efforts in that genre are compromises that are both wretched and depreciating.

Don’t compromise. 

I know that goes against everything we preach sometimes… but, really, don’t put your head inside the ass of a career because you need to feed.

There’s got to be another way out.

I don’t know. But, if you think about it hard enough, you’ll find a way to stay on course and make money from your talent and the genre you are most proud of. 

PS: I might feel differently about this in the morning, but this is how I feel now. One thing will never change though- Me, I will never use my hand to type “Blac Chyna reveals nipple as she goes shopping in LA” ever again!
