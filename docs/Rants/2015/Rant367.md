Leisure in Nigeria is expensive. That is why poor people are having all the vacation on top one another- on a mattress, in stuffy rooms, hair soaked in sweat, preaching contentment. 

If Nigeria, by any chance, gives you contentment, then you are not alive. That’s like a dead dog in Canada being content with death.

Anyway, I wanted to go to La manga this weekend.

The price didn’t seem so bad until I sounded it off with friends.

Bunmi screamed: “Inside this dirty Lagos? That money will take you to Ghana. Abeg forget it!”

I told Korede… “If you try it, I will shoot you!”

LOL!

Why? Why should it cost so much to lounge in a resort villa in my own city?

These are the little things that keep one sane, why should it eat so deep into my purse?

We’ve got to find ways of living like human beings. 

Working day in, day out. Living in traffic and sleeping with your generator on is not life.

How can we create affordable leisure for middle-class enjoyment?
