Feminism and the use of swear words. 

I am not sure when I became the face of feminism that anyone would talk about a movement with over 5 million people and narrow it to how Joy speaks. 

I think you are intolerant of my use of language. That makes you a really really bad person. 

*coughs*

Shit. Fuck. Piss off. Ass. Dick... are words. They have a place in the dictionary. 

I find that I enjoy writing because I have my liberties. I was denied the use of these beautiful words for very long because I had "to be a lady".

But I am grown now. Independent. And I am no longer a lady. 

I am a human being. And if you look closely, you'll discover I am a woman. My anatomy suggests so.

So this gender of mine is not of my doing. I was born female. I didn't have a say in it.

I came and realised this gender was born a lil bit inferior. 

It was not something I did. It was not my failing or my mistakes. I met it this way. 

A gender that should be seen and not heard. A gender that has to live under. A gender incomplete without another. 

I am not sure how you want me to react to this.

First it starts with anger. Overcooked anger; burnt and tasteless.

Why will you not let me be angry?

If someone was wrongfully accused and jailed for 50 years, will it be fair for you to judge him based on how he decides to react for being made to live less than he was created for 50 years?

If he spewed fuck all over your ish, should it be an issue?

He is an angry man. And he hates society, hates the justice system for stealing the years he'd never get back.

Leave people to express themselves as they wish.

Extreme patriarchy that many women suffer in parts of Africa will not automatically turn to a perfect egalitarian system.

It will first become a rebellious matriarchal situation. 

Deal with it.

When people are trying to find their liberty, they will stumble on all types of behaviour before they find their balance.

Let them.

Some drink and die of booze.
Others smoke and choke on cigarettes...

Others curse and...

What are the consequences of swear words?

We will not make heaven? *roll eyes*

These long essays people leave in my inbox, seeking my attention and me giving them none, is just sad.

Let a grown woman curse. Stop being such a bloody control freak.

You will control your wife, your children...and you will still infest a random woman's inbox to tell her how you think she should talk.

Are you not mad? 

You don't move from telling women to drink the water used to wash a husband's corpse, to having conversations over tea on how to build equality. 

It never happens that way.

You will first annoy the shit out of patriarchy. Give it his own medicine. Lose decorum and throw your bra at it.  Yes, eat that shit!

When our anger can finally boil an egg. And a bit of matriarchy prejudices are scored...

Then it will naturally become a high heel, coffee please, flirty situation with men and women.

Until then...stop believing your half-baked intelligence can have any effect on me.

It is evil and manipulative not to allow a woman get mad however she wishes with patriarchy. 

Just fuck off.

I am not the face of feminism. And if I was this would be our slogan:

"Fuck you, patriarchy; and all the fools you have made."

Ps: on this issue there's no corner you will come from that I will not tackle you easily to the floor. I have spent the last 3 years getting ready for this moment. Some of your questions are so elementary it just isn't worth a response. So I spill breast milk all over your stupidity.

Drink that.
