Nigerian women…

If your husband is giving your maid oral sex…and he has refused to provide same pleasure to your vagina.

My sistah, it is not the fault of Feminism.

Your maid is not a feminist. She has never heard of it, cannot spell it, doesn’t care about it.

Stop transferring your sexual frustrations on us.
*** 
If your husband throws you and the children out of the house and brings an overweight receptionist into your home to replace you- a woman ugly enough to be a mop in your kitchen, as far as you can see…

It is not Feminism that did it to you.

Receptionist cares only about her fingernails, trips to Dubai and bank account… she doesn’t have time to be sharing new knowledge about Feminism. She cannot carry new knowledge with that brain of hers.

Be angry with your man. Be angry with madam receptionist. Be pissed at your choices.

Don’t transfer any aggression to feminists nah..
*** 
If, after you wash dishes, clean cobwebs, scrub tiles, cook heaven and served it on gold-plated trays...your bobo kicked you out and chose the snobby little brat on the other street that cannot boil rice.

Feminism is not to blame nah. 

Ask that little brat, she hasn’t met one feminist her entirely life.
*** 
I know what is paining you- it is the fact that opinionated feminists have good men, yet YOU with all your ‘African subservience’ are still scouting around for anything and anyone to pay you attention.

This plantain-and-salt Feminism Hate looks stupid on you. 

“I don’t understand all this feminists, so bitter..." Yet you are the one with green veins sticking out from your neck. You are the one patching a bad situation…

How many times do I have to tell you, we don’t care about your marriage. Marry a frog and call him a prince if you like; you are entitled to your delusions.

We have men too. They respect us. They love us. They do wonderful things with/to us.

So you can see how confusing this is…

If feminists can get men yet demand equal rights (since the presence of a man is the only yardstick to measure a woman’s happiness). If we have men who support our movement- financially and emotionally; cheering us by the side. 

Where does that leave you?

It confuses you, I know. But don't hate.

“When you deny feminism, you look attractive to a man,” said a she-goat.

My dear, I am a feminist. I am opinionated. I am everything you are afraid of becoming under patriarchy…

YET, I still get the best…

Let me stop here. I dey go Oriental Hotels for #TheConversation

Ciao!
