I asked a friend to link me up with a rug seller.

Rug seller calls. We talk. He comes over with samples. I choose one. He delivers my rug and underlay.

We hassle a bit with pricing (as slight increase in figures emerge).

In a minute, Rug seller is quiet, a smile dancing on his face. He turns and says:

"You are so pretty when you frown."

Apparently he has been listening to alot of Ne-Yo. And watching ridiculous Hollywood flicks. 

I let that pass.

Rug seller goes.

Rug seller starts to call a hundred times.

I ignore his calls. 

The calls continue in the morning. Now I wonder if, may be, he forgot his measuring tape or something in my house. His persistence is jarring. 

I pick his call.

Rug seller: Hey. Good morning. So...how was your night?

*sigh*

Life is not Nollywood. Or Hollywood for that matter.

In real life, we end up with our kind.

That was how my friend, an English graduate from a reputable Nigerian university married an OND holder from one of the many Polytechnics in Nigeria. (OND in Nigeria is a flying joke). 

At the end of the day, he kicked her out and picked up an uneducated woman for a second attempt at marital happiness.

Pearls and Swines. Dogs and holy things.

You are never going to be enough for someone clearly beneath your social/intellectual rung...or your mode of ambition towards finances. 

They would want more. Or less. Of everything you cannot become.

PS: I hope y'all recognise that this post is not really about education or money or the rug seller (who may or may not have education and/or "money")? 

Read it again.
