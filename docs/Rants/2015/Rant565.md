There’s the other side of the story that is hardly told...

Since only the subordinate is allowed to lament.

So when you hear of the apprentice who was kicked out of the mechanic shop…

You only hear his cries and curses. And how he cannot feed his mother because his Oga was mean. How his children cannot buy a new ball to play with. How his wife is sick and no money for hospital bills. How he is begging from neighbours- salt, onion and sardine. 

His wailing drowns half the truth.

The other side is left untold.

You should hear the full story, you know. The ‘villain’ too should present his own report.

The part that is never told…

How the apprentice always comes late to work. How he never responds kindly to correction. How he drags his feet around with very little accomplished on the job. How his work falls below average expectation. How he grumbles. How he sleeps on the job. How he rocks mediocrity like a new born. How he finds comfort in idleness.

How he really has no right to demand anything because, really, he gives back very little.

But that is the story that is never told.

Because, as against everything you know, only the poor wants to be heard.

His lamentation is worth as many downloads as Adele’s ‘Hello’.

To be financially bigger than the next man is your curse.

And you will always be in the wrong.

So start to document your own story. Write your own account of events.

Because if you leave it in the hands of people…

HA!!!

You will not recognize the person you will become in their narrative.
