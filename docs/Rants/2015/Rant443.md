If there’s anything the last 4 hours has taught me is that people are wholly good.

We are first good, before we are given over to complication, deception, resentment, and annoyance.

We are good. Humans are born to be good.

Life is complex and sensational, with convoluted parts that mess with our good sense, our humanity.

But we are entirely good. If that makes any sense.

It must be what God sees that He continues to believe in us even when we kill ourselves because of our differences.

That good that life tries to wipe off every day. One stroke at a time.

I was called by a jeweller to model some of his pieces today. So before the beautiful beads came on, I decided to take a selfie…

Na photoshoot oh!

A lil prank never killed anyone… until I started getting calls oh! 20 calls received, 38 missed calls- people from UK, one from Abu Dhabi, another I haven’t heard from in years; inbox messages in dizzying numbers, text messages that finally froze my phone!

*Phew!

Someone even called crying- tears of joy, kwa!

Dem nor dey follow una play?! It’s not like I won a sugar refinery nah. Lol!

A friend told a friend who told her boyfriend who instructed her to get back with the name of the groom… heehee 

All in good faith. All with a lot of love. All from a good place.

We are good people. Life is only complicated.

This was fun. Folks can show love sha! Wow!

I hope I get this kind of numbers when I buy a yacht oh!

See? I haff remove cloth and gele and I am home now with my children.

Biko, I was just pulling all ya panties.

G’night.

*muaaah!
