I don’t understand.

Apparently, Freeze of CoolFM suffered domestic violence in his marriage that appeared like a pattern, a tradition of abuse...

Cuts and bruises, attacks and attempts by his ex-wife to kill him...

Yet Toni Payne advices him to... “sort this internally pls and channel the energy instead into creating awareness about male domestic abuse in a proactive way. All this won't solve anything bro. You are blessed!”

Sort this internally? Woman, his wife (according to his report) tried to strangle him!!!

What is this? What double standards are we playing here?

Do we still encourage women to sort out their abusive relationships with their spouses “internally”?

How, in God’s name, is Freeze going to “create awareness about male domestic abuse” IF HE DOESN’T TALK ABOUT IT AND SHOW PROOF OF ABUSE?

Are we programmed to even accept men as victims of abuse?

If there weren’t pictures on Instagram to show, will many believe his story?

Why are we like this?

The new rule, and part of #unlearning this sick culture that crowns marriage as the be-all of the African life, is to SPEAK OUT!

Brethren, henceforth there is no shame. Live in your truth. Open your mouth and speak!

He is not sharing this to gather pity, he shares his experience as a means of throwing the weight off his back.

It's an unburdening.

Talking about it is therapy.

Leave him alone.

We shouldn't feel the need to prescribe medication for his issues. We don't know his issues!

It is he who wears the (pair of) shoes that knows where it pinches

Let people be!

Stop cringing over another man's ability to walk in liberty.

We should all stop trying to write the script we want others to live.

You should NEVER tell a woman, child or man enduring domestic abuse to internalise the pain.

Uugh!
