We know what it is to slut shame women.

Let’s talk about slut shaming men.

Whatever a man does for a woman he desires, society shames him and accuses him of being controlled by high testosterone- sexual cravings that allow him act without thinking.

He is just one big (or small) penis; and nobody pays attention to his emotional needs.

We reduce men to animals in heat. When they explore other ways of desire (serenades, flowers, candles) we question and mock these approaches.

If my boyfriend visits every other month to be with me, society expects that it should elevate me financially.

His love should translate to me moving out of the Mainland and getting a crib on the Island because I am dating someone who can make exclusive trips just to spend time with me.

They expect the relationship to afford me a car, or boost my account.

Because it is never enough to just have a man love you and want to have a courteous sexual relationship with you…and ‘spoil’ you with little romantic gifts and gestures.

He must shake mountains and move the city and lose his breath and half his ‘estate’ for you.

A dent must appear in his account for loving a black woman.

You hear he's got houses here and there, and you start to calculate figures in your heads. Is it your money?

You have to be rewarded. He has to pay in many ways to have sex you both enjoy as adults.

We slut shame men who do not enrich us, who cannot carry our burden (and damn! How much burden we carry as women!)

That he leaves his business and life for an entire week to serenade you across the sea, counts for nothing. Our society slut shames the man for coming down a plane with only a bottle of perfume and chocolate.

His erection is humiliated once it cannot promise huge incentives.

Half the time they are not sure if they are loving us or loving a bunch of bills.

We slut shame them for breaking down to bits of emotions. 

Be a man, we say. Gather your balls, we chide.

We slut shame men for daring to have sex without plans for our own future. 

We slut shame men by reminding them of rent and bills after sex. 

These things are mutually exclusive.

We slut shame WOMEN for being too aware of their sexual needs.

Yet we slut shame MEN for daring to jump on a plane with a bag of excitement to meet our sexual needs. We make them feel inadequate for committing to commitments.

Everyone gets slut shamed.

It’s confusing.

(PS: Of course, this is not for every man. Many of y'all need to stop having erections and go erect proper goals and objectives for the choices you've made)
