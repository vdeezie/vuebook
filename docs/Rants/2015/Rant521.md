Two people...

Aisha Buhari.

Why do successful women, or women of a certain status always try to balance success with love for domestic chores? 

When Aisha Buhari reminds us that she cooks for her husband, what is it supposed to accomplish?

“I’m going to leave you soon. I want to go back home to cook for my husband because my children are here playing with you. Nobody is at home, only my husband. So, I want to go back home to be with him and also cook dinner for him”, Aisha, wife of the president, says.

How necessary is this statement when you are not addressing a group of men/women about to participate in a Knorr Cooking competition?

You are addressing children and their mothers who already know all about running home after work by 11pm to cook for a man. What more push do they need to live as they have lived all their lives?

Can women ever find themselves worthy without the need to be submissive (most times subservient) to the institution of patriarchy?

Serena Williams.

I am offended by the need for Serena to take "hot bikini pictures at the beach" after the trolls called her a gorilla, a man, a this-and-that.

Then you have ridiculous headlines like: “What muscles? Serena is stunning!”

*sigh*

This approach is sexist; can’t you see?!

She has muscles (she will always have muscles), she is black (and it is not a bad thing)… so what?! She is a sports legend for chrissakes! She is successful. Period.

No airbrushing is going to slice off her muscles or “clean up” her black complexion.

We are missing the point here.

The key word should always be “Success”.

And if that is, then the need to do something about the trolls by taking lovely bikini pictures at the beach is so unnecessary.

She has allowed herself to be fed by the lies that whatever you achieve as a woman, it is never enough… You need to be pretty.

Considering how erratic and relative "pretty" is... it ensures a woman never rises above its needs. The pretty needs.

Ask women across different social strata: “What will you choose- Beauty or Brains?”

Many, including teenagers, will choose Beauty.

“If I am fine I can get a rich man to take care of me.” A teenager told me that once.

This narrative drives me crazy!

When my daughter, for instance, becomes the most successful CEO in Africa, yet feels the need to tell a group of people about to listen to her at an international TedX gathering that she needs to hurry over her speech so she can go feed her husband…

I will feel shame to hear her say that. I will be hurt. Because it is unnecessary!

Would you normally find a man who would feel the need to announce that he has to go and clean the house, and so needs to hurry up his session?

Focus on who you are! Women, focus.

You are successful! That is enough.

Feel ugly, feel unattractive, deal with alopecia, deal with bad hair day, have droopy eyes, live with obesity, have sturdy legs…whatever!!!

Succeed anyway!

Shut up with all your physical and emotional insecurities... and succeed!
