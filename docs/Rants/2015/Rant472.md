Yesterday my 9 year old daughter, a bit worried, wanted to know if she'd be able to find a husband.

Gasp. 

She is as tall as I am. So yes, she is aiming for the sky, and she wonders if she'd find a man as tall as she'd be when the time comes. 

"I don't want to marry a short man. But as it is, I will be taller than many people."

I have never spoken about marriage with her, I always manage to leave the subject out when we talk about life goals. 

I know what it is. It's peer influence and television.

But it's not a problem. I only shrugged and told her to focus on other tall ambitions- the houses you'll buy, the cars you'll drive, the yacht you'll own, a career that dwarfs every competition.

"-Because, really, you don't have to get married."

"Ah!!!" Mouths touching the floor. She and her lil sister wore the look of horror.

"And if you want to, you will. What does it matter anyway?"

They'll be fine as long as I am alive.

To hell with Disney Channel and the half- baked love series they air; I remain my children's biggest influence. 

No shaking.

That, however, cannot be said for adults. We are aleady shaped by our influences. And the habits we form from association become who we are.

If reality TV shows and ratchet talk shows are a big part of your entertainment, you are going to go around thinking being nasty, without provocation, is the shiii.

And something in your dumb skull will make you believe you can get away with it.

You are living your own camera moment, dropping tactless comments, feeling like Wendy Williams in padded bra, believing yourself to be witty. Sounding so stupid it makes everyone wonder if you've been doing weed.

You do it once. You do it twice. You do it a third time. You are getting comfortable just being an aimless tart.

Until the day you decide to look in the mirror with the benefit of sunlight showing off your wrinkles. 

We call it the rotten truth. 

A bladder full of bile and bad bad wit that needs polishing like a toilet bowl.

Disorganised thoughts. Poor strategy. Cringe-worthy retorts. "Intelligence" over cooked- too salty, scraps of burnt effort that could never taste right. 

You are influenced by foolish people on TV and blogs. They have their makeup on when they fight. It's only a show, nobody is beating the foolishness out of them.

But in the real world, the approach is a little different. Learn the difference. 

The idea of jumping in and out of conversation trying to sound like the one who doesn't give a fuck, is embarrassing. 
Why put yourself in a position where you look like a peacock? 

Wendy shows up on your screen every other day. Her nastiness is packaged to draw an audience. To make her a brand. She's making serious money.

What's your own goal? This your wit made from an empty peak tin and bottle corks; where exactly is its ultimate destination? 

Should I, with one finger, push that truck into a garbage bin? 

Whilst we are trying to teach our kids that Disney Channel is just as relevant as a cup of orange juice, what can we tell these adults?

Let me see...

Learn your limits.

Then read a bit of Robert Greene's Laws of Power.

It will teach you all you need to know about boundaries. Some people are better than you in this game of throes. Don't trespass.

Save yourself this embarrassment of not being an equipped hater.
