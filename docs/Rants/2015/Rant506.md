When you go out with your kids, you see women smiling and winking at you. You make new friends in shopping malls. Women size your bag and the sheen of your children’s skin, then your hair before they make the next move at friendship. 

You already know this one is starting on a rocky foundation. Best to let it die like a plant trying to grow on, yes, a rocky foundation. 

Some will ask, “Are these yours?” Like your children are a basket of oranges. They want to know how old your older daughter is. “She’s so tall. Oh, you are so blessed.” 

You gotta love Nigerians… like it would be an “un-blessed” thing to have a short child.

Men are looking at your finger. Sizing the possibility of you being married (still) or single or never been married. Some will ask, others will try to crack a joke with the girls. The kids don’t care. So that strategy fails all the time. 

Some will quickly strike up conversation, “I have two girls- just like them.” But he is not looking at the girls. He is looking at your finger, then at your face. Now he is smiling.

A while back, you were having lunch with the girls at a restaurant; a man in all the wrong colours came to your table with the kind of confidence you find at a danfo park.

“Madam, hmmm, something is about to happen to you. But good news is on the way. Somebody special will come into your life and love you; your beautiful children will…”

“My frien’ will you get out of here!” A grain of rice flying out of your nose. The audacity! Right in front of your kids, whilst having lunch.

“Ah! Madam…”

“Waiter!!!” someone, anyone to throw him out of your sight.

He leaves. As he sees you will not fall for this prank like the rest of them.

It is easy; he had examined you for a second. No ring. No air of limitations. The right target.

After the "revelation", it would only be apt to ask for transport fare or money to start prayers on your behalf.

See as e jam roadblock.

Another day, another restaurant.

Three men- age bracket 38 – 42, sitting across. One is a looker.

Halfway through lunch, the looker asks:

“Are they yours?”

“Yup.”

“Amazing.”

“Thanks.”

“I have two- just like them.” The one next to him says.

“Cool.”

“They are pretty.” The third one says.

“Thanks.”

As you leave the restaurant, Mr. looker gets up and tries to strike conversation with the girls. He sucks at it. Sorry.

After a movie, you get to the shopping mall to get stuff and who do you see?

Mr. Looker.

“Ah we meet again. This time I have to get your number.”

“Is he following us?” your older daughter whispers.

Not likely. Who waits two-and-half-hours just to get a number.

He calls, but you are in a meeting that will not end in this lifetime.

He’ll get tired of this meeting woman.

And life will carry on as it should.
