Dear Writers/Authors/Literati,

Last month The Palms in Lekki closed down their book store.

Galleria shut theirs with a big padlock years back.

Nu metro dumped you many years ago.

You have no bookshops. No economic value.

Your industry is in shambles. 

But you are here, on social media, blowing grammar, looking for others who cannot speak your grammar so you can put cuffs on them...arguing like demented cows; obsessed with your own phallus.

People are not paying to read your shit. You are not selling. You are 'bad market'. 

Yet you have opinions about everything besides yourself. You are the critic. The smart ass.

Everytime a bookstore shuts down, there's a subliminal message...

You are worth very little, dear writer.

What are you going to do about it? 

Whilst you are waiting for your NLNG win, your invite to a workshop on an Island in Antarctica...

THINK about the sorry state of your industry.

Think and be ashamed.

If your tattered ego won't let you, then console yourself with the fact that your intellect, made from the finest crack shit in the yard, is designed to be unappreciated by mere mortals.
