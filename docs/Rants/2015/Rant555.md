Nigerian men,

You cannot praise Feminism only when it favours you- when you want to talk about how your mother fed you even whilst married to an irresponsible shit of a man.

You can’t clap only when a woman splits the bill after dinner at Intercontinental Hotel.

You can’t nod your head to feminism when it helps solve your financial, emotional, and sexual fiascos.

This is not a dress we put on for certain occasions and get rid off for others.

It is not a hobby. It is not a sport.

This is our life. Feminism is what we live for.

I see that after a hard life, with little to show as exceptional or phenomenal, any bloody phallus can decide to sit on Feminism to try and gather some kind of attention. 

You cannot be sane.

When you write your stupid articles about wives or husbands of superstars…,or about women who eat up your disrespect like a sandwich…or about slapping a woman and then fucking her deliciously all in 10 minutes of rage and lust…

Leave feminism out of your definition of what you think a woman should be.

What the hell is wrong with these losers?

You cannot write about Annie Idibia and conclude your cum with: feminists should learn from her.

Learn how?

She is married. What is there to learn?

Look into your homes. Your mothers lived that life already- married, patient, long suffering, forgiving to the moon and back (forget that they fight everybody else EXCEPT the penis they must fuck every night)

If you want your daughters to learn from Annie, then by all means speak to the womb of your wives-to-be or turn to your daughters and pray upon them the Annie Idibia blessing.

Trust me, you'll be within your rights.

BUT the minute Feminism enters the matter…you are an idiot. A moron.

Just say that you are looking for a woman who can forgive you after sleeping with your neighbour's sister, and every other girl in the hood...and on the other side of the hood.

...and the hood after the other hood.

...and after the hood of that hood.

...of the hood.

To infinity.
