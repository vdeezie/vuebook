One of my writers broke down during our Monday meeting.

The rest of them had their hands up, like:

"Boss, don't look at me oh. I'm not the one who hurt her."

They were really hot tears oh, and they wouldn't stop. Two hours later her eyes were still swollen.

Apparently, she's been having a hard time getting along with the others...But I'm busy trying to make money for the company, I don't see these things. Everything here looks fine to me.

But you know office politics is a course they keep away from the boss.

I don't even care what petty jealousy they get up to behind my back, I love them all equally. I love my team in a way I have not loved any group of people. Ever...

I can't hold them to every "fight" they have amongst themselves. We have bigger dreams. The inconsequential nothings will wither eventually.

So what if they are jealous (or not) that she seems like my favourite (which is not even true! I am not a woman of favourites, I think).

She shouldn't let these things affect who she is.

She shouldn't.

So I told her to cry a river.

We all watched her cry.

The most uncomfortable 20 minutes of our corporate lives. Lol! Not for me though. I like raw emotions.

"Cry. Then tell me when you are done," I said.

Tears gone. Eyes red with tired grief. 

"Are you done?" I asked.

She nodded.

Then I told her:

"Now remember this, You are a god. Nobody here can do what you do. You are one of the best talents I am proud to nurture. And when CNN starts a fashion TV...or one of these super rich Nigerian media poach you, go. Go and conquer the world. Fly. Become. Don't stop."

She managed a smile.

"Put it on your wall in your room: Joy says I am a god. Become who you are."

She nodded. 

"Fuck what opinions people have. You rock. You hear me?"

She blushed.

And to the rest, I tell them we are all diamonds.

Phew.
