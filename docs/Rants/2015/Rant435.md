So...

They haff found the children. 

*smh

When you finish jubilating, be curious enough to ASK questions. 

If they've found the kids, what role did the police play?
Have the kidnappers been arrested?
Was a ransom paid?
Where did they pick them up from - a bush path, a road, or a cupboard? 
The kidnappers, can we have the parents relay their experience leading to the release of the kids?
The money raised for criminals on social media, will it be returned or used for aso-ebi?

*sigh*

Are you not tired of being so gullible?

So shamefully uniterested in minority report?

I blame religion. An unoriginal tradition. 

Hallelujah for all the daft reasons.
