We are not ready to run an honest society.

Observe the way people respond to material things.

If you are not driving it or wearing it, you don’t have it.

I remember when I used to work for my brother- the most industrious young man I know, diligent and responsible (silly me, I went into life thinking all men came in that package. Oh whatta surprise LOL!)…

He was good at his job; amazing wit and creative nous.

But when we went for meetings to get an account, they- starting from the ignorant wretch at the gate- would immediately judge him in a Nissan saloon.

My bro is not materialistic at all, but this frustrated him to the point where he had to go buy two SUVs at once. LOL!

“I just have to shut these bastards up. Join them or keep fighting with security guards just to get through a freaking gate,” he would say.

And then he got two Camry for good effect.

-Because society.

There was nothing wrong with that Nissan. It was clean and decent; engine in superb condition. But society expected him in something else; so from the annoying gateman with barely enough to eat to the receptionist in her tattered accent, my bro was beat into submission because we are a myopic covetous lot. Thankfully he had the funds to back it up.

I remember when I used to wear weaves… and since I work in a Lifestyle glossy industry, your head of faux hair would determine how seriously people would take you. These women can tell a N350k weave from a N25k weave a mile away.

You are judged immediately.

I have more liquid cash than many of them oh. My kids go to more expensive schools. I pick up bills faster than they ever can… But I am not wearing a pair of Louboutin so my financial status is judged.

Don’t laugh. Many people are like that.

That is why we have girls who have never worked their whole lives, flashing an iPhone. Men with very little income driving very expensive cars. Women dumping their kids in rundown public schools just so they can use their funds to buy LV bags and travel to Dubai instead.

Society sets the standards for us. 

So when you are out with people, you have to wear your Rolex, carry your Peruvian weave, clutch your Hermes bag, and bath in your Versace perfume…how else would they think you have enough to feed your children nah.

Take all the money you have, borrow some and buy a Limousine. Then quietly beg family and friends for fuel every other week.

Else people who have known you only for a minute will have the nerve to question the kind of food your children eat, what they wear, their school fees and the colour of your bank account.

How do you tell a Nigerian you are comfortable if they can’t see it around your neck?

Humility in finance is the test we fail every day. The only life subject we pass with flying colours is Religious Humility. 

Olodo.

You can’t have a Zukerberg as a black man.

We are our own black problem- even when we try to be “humble” about how far-God-has-brought-us, we still expect to manipulate people’s responses and reactions to our kindness. 

Benevolence that is manipulated is no benevolence.

You can like to go and die.

See why people fake the part?  

Get a house in Lekki and drink garri all year round

Buy a yacht and run a drug cartel underground 

Living a decent comfortable life, picking all your bills…without the flashy bric-a-brac tailing you is not enough.

That's our sick society.
