“2014, that was my vacation. 2015? Damn, I ain’t gonna leave nothing on the table, baby. I’m fucking greedy. You think I’m talking about ‘some money’? Niggas on my comment page saying, ‘Damn Diddy, leave some for the rest of us.’ Nigga (if) you don’t hustle, you don’t eat. You don’t hustle, you don’t eat, nigga. Hustle harder. They ain’t never gonna hustle hard as me. You think I do this shit just for money… ‘Why you so mad Diddy?’ I’m not mad. I’m disappointed.

“I’m giving you the blue print to give it out here and you don’t wanna do what it takes. You wanna stay on your Instagram all day. Taking mothafuckin’ selfies and ain’t hustling hard. Hustle harder, bitch. 

"See it’s 2015, man. You get a fresh new start. I want you to feel what it feels like to be able to give your family whatever they want in the world. I want you to be able to tell your mama, ‘Mama, just dream anything and I’ll get it for you.’ Now this is the last thing I’mma say to you. Don’t be following people. Be a leader.”  - Sean Puffy Combs

The Nigerian response to all this long American grammar:

“All these fuck fuck and swearing, can’t he make his point without swearwords? Anyway to each his own. Life is not measured by another man’s success. I’m sure he has some things in his life that money cannot cure or buy. So let’s just be grateful for life and God’s timing. No matter how little you have, you are an inspiration to someone. Be thankful for that. Someone wants the N500 you used to buy lunch today. That’s life.”

Dear Nigerians, I have helped you with your typical response, don’t bother typing it here. Your penchant for ignoring the substance of a text is legendary. Just in case it speaks directly to you, you turn the message on top of its head to walk.

You wonder why you’d have 10,000 followers on Twitter, for instance, yet you cannot sell 500 copies of your craft to your audience in one year? You talk and talk and post and tweet clever subs…you get a few nods and thumbs up and you think it means anything.

There’s no bigger failure than not being able to sell to your community on social media after 100,000 tweets. A ready-made audience, yet you loaf around like a pregnant cow, albeit intelligent; which makes it even sadder.

Turn those units around to mean something or get out of it before it kills you.
