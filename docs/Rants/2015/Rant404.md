# Rant404


March 13, 2015

Let’s talk about this type rant for a minute:

“Money is not important to me, I care more about people and how to help them in life’s journey to be better and achieve their dreams.”

This saying is as shitty as Mercy Johnson telling us about taking a train (with ORDINARY Nigerians) to a quick meeting whilst her Range Rover is parked by the side of the road, hoping to connect with fans on the trip.

*yawn*

Even though it sounds “humble”, it is by far one of the most arrogant and condescending things to say. I don’t see how people fall for it.

Only Nigerians fall for faux-humility, because our culture promotes it. Ever had an uncle who kicks your mother out of her matrimonial home after the death of your father and then proceeds to "help you" through school, telling the whole world how he is struggling to sponsor his brother's child (with your father's money oh)!

And politicians who construct ONE borehole and ONE major road and ONE classroom, then get their supporters to erect a billboard thanking them for helping the community. He pays N600k for an AD page in a newspaper to talk about the N300k borehole he did in a community diseased with lack.

Faux-humility. And we buy into it easily.

Now back to that silly statement above. Such an "eyah" moment, abi? Rubbish!

First off, the most important means to help would come through your ability to give. What do we give- our time, our counsel, and lots of money.

Money remains the best giver of all. It gives and keeps giving; it will solve issues prayers can never solve.

Money will answer your questions faster than your 10-days fasting.

Money runs faster than a leopard. It accomplishes quicker, sooner.

Unless for certain circumstances beyond human control, money is by far the most profound miracle you could (and should) ask for.

The fact that you do not acknowledge this very important role (of money) in your faux desire to love people like Jesus loves the world, shows a desperation that is pitiful. 

How do you begin to love people when you claim not to care much for money? 

What is love? How does it express itself? So after Nneka tells you she needs a job, what do you do? You talk, you encourage, you share the N2k in your pocket…and because it is all you’ve got with no real love for money, you believe the world will take a 360 degree turn and give you a big hug?

For your information, Nneka is still broke. N2k split into two will solve only lunch; your counsel will be like fuel in her engine for a few hours…then she’s back to lack that is as deep as your ignorance.

Simplicity most times is a shield for a big fat pride.

Some of the “humble” people I know, have the biggest, most unsettling egos. 

You need money. You need it like you need air. You need it to help Nneka and Johnny and Pompom and you need it for yourself.

And if at all you have to share this humble crap on a table, look around and be sure you are sharing your "humility" with people who'd give the same definition.

Humility, for me, is giving people a chance even when you know they are built only to be disrespectful and self-absorbed. You give them a chance because you are humble enough to BELIEVE in the good in the next person, however impossible it can be most times. But you know flaws are part of what the human being is and your belief, even when there's nothing that should propel it, grows from the need to be unassuming.

Then humility is also knowing when to finally tell them to go fuck a dead tree.
