I am watching a series on TV...

An older man walks up to a younger man at a bar, and the conversation that follows kills me with laughter…

Young Man: Are you stalking me?

Old Man: Of course not. I am here to – 

Young: Quench your thirst? You are thirsty, but not for a drink.

Old: Huh?

Young: I know what you want. I can give it to you.

Old: I don’t pay for sex.

Young: You’d be paying for discretion and privacy, not sex 

Old: I see.

Young: I can take you upstairs, or you can go home and find a pathetic way to quench that thirst.

Minutes later, wads of dollars exchange hands as the younger man displays his phallus in a tight fitting Justin Bieber-sque (Calvin Klein) style.

LMAO!!!

Brilliant scriptwriters have a special place of luxury in Heaven.
