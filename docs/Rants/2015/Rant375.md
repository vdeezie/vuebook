I had the most interesting conversation yesterday:

“Joy, you work like a zombie”

“Huh?”

“I say you work like a zombie”

“How?”

“You just sit there, very effective, ignoring my calls, and I can tell you don’t care about half the things you are writing on or the people you are doing it with…”

“Wow”

“Yup. That’s what I see. You have one-liners for everything concerning your job/duty to writing; but when it comes to social issues, culture and tradition, politics, feminism and the Nigerian psyche, you go on and on I’d have to hand you a drink for you to stop.”

“Writing is the only thing that pays my bills…” 

“Agreed. It pays. Maybe you are writing the wrong things… At least, you’d have a conversation with me about work- about writing as a job, which you never do. You don’t say anything, you just shrug and continue working.”

“But…”

“How does anyone sit on their bed for 18 hours straight everyday writing stuff and yet slams their laptop and not say a word about all that work to the person beside them. Like you hate it, but you have to do it, because you are too stubborn to place a call and say: I’d rather not do this.”

“I like writing.”

“You don’t get the point. Maybe if you write about the stuff that you are passionate about on a level that it receives the kind of attention and wages like the stuff you write that you really don’t care about, then you’d be happy. You are not happy.”

“I am”

“No you are not. You hate what you (have to) do.”

“I like…”

“What is your greatest passion at the moment?”

“Politics.”

"Why?"

"Because it just dawned on me that my kids have no future in this country..."

“Good. Go to Abuja and write about politics. I have a house – “

“Wait, hold on for one second. What are you saying?”

“You are the one who keeps on nagging everyone about having just One Life, but you are stuck in your apartment writing stuff you don’t share with anyone or talk about. I have to literally drag you up to go and have dinner- your first meal in a day!”

“I need a vacation”

“Yes, you do. And you also need to stop proving anything to anyone. You are a good writer. I think that’s clear enough. Just stop killing yourself over mediocre work.”

It’s official. I hate him. LOL!
