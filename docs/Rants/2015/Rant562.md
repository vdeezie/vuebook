Let me tell you about Kitay.

She was the lady who sat beside Mrs. Omoh at the last #TheConversation held in Lagos. 

You remember her story? A shocking, heartrending tale of marital abuse and parental ignorance and negligence.

At 19, married off to a stranger, denied education...her freedom- basic human rights snatched from her by a husband. Turned into a babymaking machine; left to tend to the faeces of a dying in-law while her dreams ended in the bin- like wraps of the poop she was made to clean everyday. 

I told her to leave her number that day at #TheConversation. Remember? 

She did.

Later she would reach out to me and in clear terms tell her situation.

Broke and in need of a job.

I invited her for the Happenings launch event that held a while back. 

"If you like what you see, then we can talk about how you fit in," I said.

She wanted to be a writer.

No. Not another writer. I was bored already. 

She could be "more".

This is a young woman who fought her way out of a bad marriage, acquired an education without support from anyone. She redefined her life. And there's not a trace of any of the ugliness in her demeanour.

What are your other strengths? I asked.

I love to network. I like meeting people. Attending events. Building relationships. I'm interested in people and their stories. She responded. 

She works with us now as a marketing/publicity executive. 

In just three weeks she has booked appointments with Huawei, plugged our magazine into major events, and shows the kind of potential you'd want to invest in.

She can become a writer at her spare time. 

So today in the office, she saw my bag and smiled:

"Ma, I like your bag."

"Thank you, Kitay."

"I really like your bag."

"Kitay, thank you."

"Um...it's a fine bag."

"Ok Kitay, you can have it."

Lol!

Just a month ago she was a stranger.

Today, she is a part of a big dream I am passionate about.

This life. This life.
