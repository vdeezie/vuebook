Everytime Reno Omokri opens his mouth, shit drops. 

Here we are just happy with the fact that Jonathan watered the plant of democracy with his last action; hence restoring some of his dignity...

That errand boy then shows up and drags GEJ back into the mud with this Nobel Peace prize nonsense. 

It is because of thoughtless individuals like Reno (that) the president lost-

People who just want to be in their own reality show arguing whether to wear a butt pad or a pony tail when Rapture occurs.

Two extremes. No relevance. 

Daft as hell.

How do you lose with so much stupidity still residing in your loins.

Frankly, I think the dude really dislikes GEJ. 

This desperate love is truly hate.
