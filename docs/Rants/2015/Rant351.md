# Rant351


January 12, 2015

It is not the subservient that should be called into government; it is the hard-hitting individual who crashes on all the ambiguous policies. 

It is the crazy one who refuses to follow the rules, the ones we think are just arrogant and unbending.

The ones who criticise, who spot every hole; they attack, they stand out like sore thumbs.

The ones easily disliked. The ones who jump in and out of conversations and leave others enraged.

The ones who stand alone. No appetite for prejudice. The ones who’ll do it like something from a Scorsese movie.   

So if Nicholas Ibekwe (that stubborn journalist of a wahala someborry LOL!), for instance, is called to be part of a presidential and/or political media campaign...after all his weighty opinions, earth-quaking pieces, bravado, and merciless features…You expect him to say No? Are you drunk?

He better jump in on that campaign and play his part.

Scream all you want: “He sold out.” “He betrayed his principles”

No, he didn’t. He just got the right opportunity in the right position to effect all he has been complaining about.

YOU, on the other hand, sitting on a wet stool, calculating the money you believe he was acquired for are the biggest loser, the cheapest goods on the shelf; you sold out long time- you need to restock your wits; who knows, government might find you worthy of a position to effect change.

We have asked for years that the status quo be amended, adjusted to accommodate fresh ideas, new individuals, younger and more vibrant qualities; government is doing that, bringing younger people in, to hopefully wash out this old stock of malevolence that exists…

YET it is still the young people who will come out on social media to criticise those who have a shot at making a difference.

Truth be told, we want the Atikus and the FFks to remain. We have grown a comfy aversion for those ones that we can live with their stupidities..

But we cannot imagine that “one of us” will be elevated to a position that will eventually further our cause.

We love where we are- this angry, cheeky, deprived state of worry, clowning and stark hopelessness.

Deep down, we love it this way. God forbid that "one of us" becomes greater than "all of us".

Else how do you justify all this stupid rant that "Toyosi has been bought"...and other sorry tales?
