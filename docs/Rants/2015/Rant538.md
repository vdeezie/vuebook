Why are we "proud" that David Oyelowo will become the first black Bond?

Facebook Update: I am so proud to be Nigerian. Oyelowo is going to act Bond.

Would white people show any pride if DiCaprio was made to act Malcom X? 

The audio Bond. 

An approach that makes him lesser than a Bond- a character known for good style, panache and looks.

Qualities we will not get to see if his voice is all that is needed.

Yet we celebrate.

Shoprite opens in Edo state. We celebrate.

Rochas shakes Obama. We celebrate.

Chairman of a local government plasters road with cement. We celebrate.

We celebrate below-average accomplishments...

-Because the black man truly sees himself as inferior to any other race.
