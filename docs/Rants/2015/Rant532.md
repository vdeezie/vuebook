"If you are angry, it doesn't mean you are an Engineer. Engineering is not about anger. Some people are just bitter. Bitterness is not Engineering. Stop fronting your issues in place of Engineering."

Read those sentences again. And again.

Replace Engineer with different professions you know...

Banker. Surgeon. Writer. Housewife. Booty shaker. Mother. Mechanic. Vulcaniser. Plumber. Pilot.

And lastly, replace it with Feminism...

Then tell me if it is out of order to address people who talk like this...

As retards.

We try to educate these fools everyday. Temperament has very little to do with any career, any mission, any cause. 

The angry scientist is still a scientist. 

But because Nigerians want a calm scientist, they want to rid the angry scientist of her title because she doesn't come as they would like her to be.

Please enter your house and face your wall. 

As the earth can sustain itself without humans, so can feminism or any other cause sustain itself without your opinions, posts or delusions.

Ps: If you have a dumb friend, save the world by educating them.

You just might be the solution to climate change.
