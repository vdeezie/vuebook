That was how someone came to my door, ranting:

“Sister good affnun. Err…sister, it is not that broda doesn’t love you, he loves you; and he still want to marry you, but the money is not yet complete and he is saying you should wait small. He say small time you people will get married. Don’t let devil come between two of you. And he doesn’t want you to be thinking about it too much. He say I should tell you that soon he’ll come and see your people...and you should please pick your phone and stop crying..."

Just like that- no introductions, nothing. Just straight to the matter. I was amused and I let him rant…

“He say he will collect the pregnancy that no need for abortion and he will talk to his pastor, there’s no worry about that. Even he has told mummy about it and everybody is ok with it…”

He continued oh! Talking non-stop like some fraudulent pastor. After, say, 10 minutes I asked a simple question:

“Dude, who, in God’s loving mercies, are you looking for?”

“I’m looking for Sister Judith nah. Are you not sister Judith?”

“No, I am not Judith.” (thank God!)

“Ah sorry oh! My uncle say dark tall woman with short hair for dis address.”

“What is the address?” 

“K close.”

“This is not K close.”

“Okaaaaay!” was all the apology he could render. And off he went, like a lost rabbit.

We are a peculiar people.

A Nigerian will write a foolscap motivational response to a post, for instance, only for you to discover s/he didn’t take the time to UNDERSTAND the post. Speech longer than the original post with comprehension evidently missing. 

We just want to say what we want to say and let it be on record that we said what we wanted to say with all the right tenses and adjectives.

You gotta love Nigerians.
