We write the way we are.

You remember when your 56 year old aunt got pregnant for the first time in a life that was dedicated solely to (trying to) getting pregnant…and she delivered triplets?

You asked: How did this happen?

They answered: “If you will allow your destiny to shapen *sic* your desires, you will find yourself fulfilling purpose.”

That shit doesn’t make any sense, but that is how we talk. 

No facts. No back story. No lead. No point.

Haven’t you observed? We fluff over everything.

America has Crime&Investigation channels that get to the bottom of every criminal matter.

They’ve got Bloomsberg that interprets every business mistake and feat of successful people.

The day they interviewed Sheryl Sandberg and Oprah Winfrey on the same panel… they dug deep into wells to extract worn underwear from failed relationships, parking tickets, endorsement cheques, bills for dinners and vacation, business partners, bad decisions etc.

An all-inclusive interview that would leave you exhausted and rejuvenated (all at once) with new knowledge after 60 minutes. 

When your broke neighbour, who greets your mother a hundred times through shut gates, waiting for the perfect moment when her shoulders are rested so he can beg for garri, comes home with a brand new car and a carpenter to pimp his crib...

You asked: How did he come about this kind of money?

They answered: “He grabbed his destiny by the balls and discovered his way to prosperity. If only we can learn from his resilient spirit that reflects the aesthetic of the images behind his passion”

Like…really. This is incoherent!

But that is how we are. THIS is how we communicate.

It’s too much religion and too many motivational seminars that make even analytical journalists/writers begin to sound like Mike Murdock on crack.

So you bump into an “inspiring story” of, say, Mo Abudu’s success…this is what you’d be left to feed on:

“When I met Ms. Abudu last year at the cinema, her black complexion shone and her mien cascaded into waters of peace and tranquillity…”

*side eye*

“She walked with so much grace and panache that you will know that she was made for the limelight to shine bright like a diamond…”

*sigh*

“Her glory began the day she decided to own her destiny in her hand and fulfil her purpose on earth. While her mates were gunning for the vain things of the world, she went for her dreams and grabbed for herself a star in the orifices of the sky…”

*hian*

“I remember that she has been a TV presenter before. My love for her grew stronger when she turned her passion to business and created EL TV; and I said to myself that I too shall succeed from the belly of the stomach of victory that prevails.”

You just want to take a gun and shoot someone.

And we love this shit. This garbled madness.

Where do you draw the line between HER story and your bewildered grammar?

There are three things:

It’s either the interviewees are not telling…
The journalist/interviewer is not asking…
Or we are just full of dumb shit.

I go with the latter.
