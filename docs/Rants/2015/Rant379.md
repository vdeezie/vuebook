Someone please make me understand…

That moment between lovers, after rounds of amazingly average sex, exhausted and delighted, that usually triggers the ‘Ex discussion’, what is it really about?

Limp penis, throbbing vagina, a good recipe to start bashing both your Exes?

After sex, the story-telling begins. What the last man did to you, how he hurt you so badly and you was just an angel in the relationship.

What the lady did to you- you that you are so simple and uncomplicated, how she planned to ruin your life.

Isn’t it a tad bit pathetic? Why do we need to talk about Exes? Too much American soap operas?

I’m sorry, but ‘The Ex Talk’ is the most hypocritical part of every relationship.

-Because there’s not one person who would gladly admit that they were wrong or at least carry 50% of the responsibility of a failed relationship. Not one person. They are going to paint the situation to their favour. So why even bother asking?

After one orgasm, you need to fake another one by discussing Exes so that you can be gratified that you are dating one of the few decent people left on earth?

If you enjoy it, then you probably deserve half the embellishments on the seam of that tale.

Unless you had a dramatic relationship where she put a knife to your throat; or he set you up for jail time. Or a dramatic story- like a family of 10 sisters, all single mothers and never been married… something out of the norm that looks extremely odd and curious… then fine, cook that story until it tastes like good gourmet meal.

But if it is a situation of he-hurt-me, she-hurt-me…then there is NO point eating the bottom of the pot in a new relationship.

I don’t want to know, ‘cos you are not going to tell me what you did to her, it is what she did to you.
And don’t ask me either. There’s no point. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I’d rather gist with my friends, laugh, choke on a bottle of Snapp and move on to other matters.

I think the need to make a relationship the carrier of all our past, present and future issues is the reason they are such a drag.

After sex, play chess, drink wine, watch some TV and have another round. Leave the Exes out of your binge. You’d be shocked to hear what they have to say about you if they were ever to crash your love party.

Wake up, abeg.

Eros relationships are not meant to solve your problems. They are meant to help you forget them.

Too much weight on someone just because you are sexing?

Na wa.
