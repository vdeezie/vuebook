About Bill Cosby’s rape allegations and all the confusion and drama that come with it.

It is easy to want to believe these women; rape is, after all, a very delicate issue. God forbid you hold any doubt as a woman and you voice it out, people will be quick to judge you and your “feminism”.

We want to believe he did it because of the numbers. Numbers don’t lie. The more the women, the truer the possibility of rape and assault.

But this is not always true; and I will give a very simple everyday example:

One person comes out and says, for instance:

“Joy is arrogant” on a post

Another person- someone who probably sends me “hello” every week in the last 4 years; bitter that I have not responded to his/her hello, will jump on the post and say:

"Yes, she is damn arrogant.”

Another person, sad as can be, who I probably had an e-argument with, goes in gleefully and adds:

“I concur. Arrogant bitch”

Another one- who for some reason is friends with people I don’t care much for- sits on a lazy ass to hear concocted gist, buys it with her money and keeps it in her heart- will find a good opportunity to add her voice:

“That woman. I pity her. Arrogant thing”

Then another- a toaster maybe, or one of those women who just want to be friends by fire-by-force and are still left out in the cold, will only be too glad to add her miserable two cents:

“She thinks she’s all that. Plain arrogant”

A former subordinate who I had to sack for always talking to a boyfriend on the phone instead of working, will come across the post, do a ‘shoki’ and add her own bit:

“She is so arrogant. No wonder she is single.”

Then an Ex might jump in. Ah! The perfect icing on the cake:  

“Y’all don’t know her like I do. And I am happy you all see why it didn’t work out between us.”

(These are just fictional examples of the senselessness of numbers, but I hope you get my drift?)

So you see, it is easy to build the numbers. So easy. 

Don’t believe the numbers.

I have immense goodwill. I am not sure why, but it could be because I ALWAYS, without any exception, get to know people firsthand. I hardly make assumptions based on hearsay. The only time I do that is when I find out the person has (already) made assumptions about me based on hearsay! That way, I don’t even bother- you are already an asshole.

Yet, even with the huge support and generosity I enjoy, I have suffered the hate of numbers too.

Numbers tell really bad lies.

So, you know, let’s be careful with this Bill’s rape allegations buttered with numbers.  

It makes for good gossip and entertainment; the kind of sweet hate that makes our miserable lives glamorous for a minute, but these claims might not be true.
