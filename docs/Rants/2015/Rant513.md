You know...

Freeze, OAP Cool fm, flaunts designer watches that run into millions all the time.

I think watch-busters have confirmed a few times that his collection of wrist watches are authentic.

Ok.

Except for a few who-does-he-think-he-is comments here and there, largely the world is fine with it. No judgment passed.

Now imagine a female OAP of same status flashing designer watches with jaw dropping cost.

The narrative will be "slightly" different:

"Who is this one fucking? How can she afford a watch worth millions?"

"This is how she will wear her unborn children's school fees on her wrist."

"My dear, it is not by wrist watch you will take to find husband. All this things is vanity upon vanity."

"Later now, they will say they cannot find husband. Who will be able to afford this lifestyle she is living?"

Bloggers will snoop around like dogs looking for one picture that might expose the "mystery guy"; quench their depraved minds.
***
I've said it many times, Elnathan talks about prostitution as a means to substitute his writer's wage. 

Nobody has picked up on it.

He throws this in the faces of bloggers and tweeps, yet nobody finds it interesting enough.

Wait for a woman to pull same joke, and watch as social media collapse with hate opinions.

When Sugabelly talked about her body count...

Bloggers destroyed her, unleashed their prejudices on her and left her for dead.

We cannot pick up and drop feminism as we wish. We cannot hang on to only narratives that please our biases and spit out the rest.

This is what we do.

-Because patriarchy.
