If you truly want to understand the concept of Hate…

You need to study Serena Williams’ trolls:

She is successful at tennis because “she is built like a man”.

I don’t know men who look like Serena…Pray tell, how many men look like this? (see pix)

But hate lacks common sense and suffers high myopia.

She is doing very well in business because… “she has a rich husband”.
She is making such great feats because… “she is forceful like a man”.
She gets a lot of love and favours because, you know… “she doesn’t exactly look her age”.
She is going to win that contract because… “she is prettier”.

On and on and on…hate is built on excuses for others successes, and justifications for hater's own failings.

I have not achieved much because… “Nigeria is not built like America.”

You are sitting in your father's house, waiting for the 90 year old man to die so you can inherit his N365,000 life savings as your jackpot for life...

Yet you think it is legal for you to have any kind of opinion about Serena's success?

“Maybe she is Trans sef. DNA, anyone?”

Stupid.

Either way, carry on.
