Celebrity? No, thank you!

It is almost a precarious idea to request that Nigerian celebrities headline your event.

I have been asked many times why I don’t involve celebrities in my events since I work closely with some of them.

It would be damaging for me and offensive to my guests to have a “celeb”, for instance, with spasm of facts on a subject breeze through an event like a badly scripted Nollywood movie.

One minute Omotola claims she doesn’t believe in Equal Rights, the next minute she is in Johannesburg as an ambassador for ONE campaign’s “poverty is sexist”. 

The excruciating disparity.

How do you move from such disgraceful pronouncement to championing a campaign that is determined to close the gnawing financial gap between the sexes; hence create the Equality she doesn't believe in? Would we expect the actress to draw from a well of experience acquired through an enthusiastic love for knowledge on the subject- one that she has not?

Who are we fooling?

We know it’s the perfect gloss. Purged of common sense, of value, of a well thought-out motive. 

It is what we believe would get the attention of people, and make it to newspaper pages and blogs; even if it overshadows the whole essence of your event.

This act munches on the substance of what you stand for. I don't play like that.

Monalisa Chinda believes she was created to be under a man, from one side of her mouth… from the other side she claims, at a Pearl International conference held in Abuja, that: “In a relationship, both parties are relevant and no one is more superior than the other’’

Such troubling contradictions from people we should allow to breathe only within the securities of their own awareness. 

We keep dragging celebrities out of their comfort zones, lured by money, to become intellectuals of sort, fortified with Martin Luther King type oratory skills that can bring about a revolution.

How? Where? Who dash monkey?

Just because he has the hottest track on MTV Base countdown for 12 weeks shouldn’t possibly translate to eloquence on a theme on, say: “Assessing the Academic and Economic Appropriation of Hegemonic Masculinity”

It’s the same problem with religion. A pastor, beyond his theatricals on Sunday, dabbles into your relationship, your finances, your career, your social beliefs. You let him gloss over your life like a chicken with sand.

We give too much credit to people who should have limited access or opportunity to speak their minds…

What comes out as original thoughts is so shameful, most of the time. These people are not social changers.

Think Angelina Jolie and George Clooney. Then close the book.

We should make new celebrities of our own; people who represent our voices.

I will pay to listen to Funmi Akinsola talk about advancing the possibilities of the girl child, I will not pay or attend an event to hear Chika Ike or Seyi Shay talk on the same subject…

I might pay to watch them perform, if it ever comes to that.

Might.

To substantiate this fact with an even more disturbing instance…I welcome Ronke Oshodi- Yoruba Actress. Celebrity. Public Figure. Famous Pelzin…all the rot.

See this picture? As the blog stated, “she met this random dude on the road…”

And here is the best caption she could offer:

“We should always give thanks to God the owner and creator of life, if you and I should have been created like this what would we have done? Can I hear you praise him?”

I read it more than once to be sure it wasn't a joke.

Blink, and she would become the ambassador for, let’s say: “Love Your Body! No Body Shame Foundation”… and be invited to THINK or SPEAK in any capacity.

*Shudder!*
