Another friend is going through a bad marriage, divorce hanging in the air.

I never get used to these things.

As often as it occurs and they call to cry on the phone and share their stories…

Every story is new, every story kills me, every story hurts.

Every story leaves me sad for days.

I think of what to do, how to help this woman.

Every woman’s pain is unique and should not be merged into any statistics.

I just want to reach out and hold her and help her as much as I can.

I think the craziest thing to tell a woman in this situation is to “hold it together”

It is too early to “hold it together”.

This is not some fuck boy relationship hooliganism, this is marriage.

A legal union, with kids to show.

Why would you ever think the right advice is to “hold it together”?

Her emotions are going to be everywhere. Let her to cry; let her curse; let her grieve, let her lose her mind.

She’ll get it back. On her own terms. Without anyone sharing their oh-so amazing story of recovery.

“When it happened to me…”

Save it! That shit never cured anyone’s pain.

Let her record her own hurt as she wishes.

Your job is to help her through the journey- financially and emotionally

Leave her to run mad. 

Sanity will come. It always does.

Right now, I am just concerned about her financial state…

-Because I KNOW a woman can pay her way out of misery.

Happiness is a product that can be bought. 

I’m sorry that just messes with all your set values, abi?… but that’s a minority opinion; so don’t let it eat your hair out.

So the first thing I usually would say is: “get your finances right; everything else will fix itself.”

And as a friend you stand and ensure that happens.
