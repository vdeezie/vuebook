DSTV has increased its rates, and folks on Twitter are standing on one side of their heads on the matter...as usual.

This is how we gradually erase the middle class in Nigeria, because when middle-class protests, people have their noses in the air.

"Shebi you can afford DSTV premium...and you are complaining! Is it food or portable water or good roads? Go and find something worthwhile to fight for."

I am certain most of the loud smelly voices on Twitter do not pay premium. Their N4,999k rendezvous with DSTV allows them to fart around.

How can anyone have a problem with anyone who questions DSTV for increasing their rates? So what if it is a private company?!

If MTN increases it's subscription fee from N1,500 to N4,800 one sunny afternoon, enjoying its rights as a private company to fuck you up, would it be out of order to boycott? Would it be fair to tell you to "forget phones nah, after all there were no phones in 1991. Trek to the persons house."

If you think that is ridiculous, that is how you sound on this DSTV matter.

I pay that premium shit every month. Why? I don't know. I don't watch TV. My kids haven't been around in weeks, but I pay. It's a habit, one I have to kick fast.

I was enraged when I heard about the increase. These are practices they wouldn't dare in their own country. 

It is not ok for DSTV to make these increase every other year. I remember when premium was all off N6,700. See the steady climb, and people think because it's a bourgeois problem, it is not problem enough.

The rich have a right to complain when dollar exchange wreck their indigenous businesses, the poor have a right to roll in the mud and blackmail everyone for their state of penury...

But the middles class? "Shut up abeg, look for an alternative."

Like they don't matter.

It is annoying to think that I have to pay that much for entertainment. Don't tell me to get GoTV or whatever the fucking lower options are available; let me get upset with DSTV; let me query their prices, let me get pissed and be worried. 

When I am done, I will dig into my well and quench that thirst again.

It is a middle class way of dealing with pain. Why does that make you so mad? 

Leave middle class to worry about their fancy little luxuries; they work very hard for every penny they make.

You sit on Twitter, that is your claim to fame.

Some others can't even manage a tweet a day because they don't want to rely one some pastor spitting over their heads in prayer: "May you afford DSTV premium, in Jesus' name!"

Some things shouldn't end up as a prayer point. So they work their asses off.
And when they do, they don't deserve to get basic entertainment for ridiculous sums.

Private company or not!
