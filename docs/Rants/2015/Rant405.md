Single “mothers” make really lousy choices (I use that term loosely, as it involves both men and women taking care of kids)

I’ll tell you why...

There’s guilt somewhere of having made certain decisions, and there’s a need to repair that decision through the next relationship.

I’ve seen it play out many times.

This great single dad, dating this lousy chick, patching the relationship tediously like an old worn dress. 

Why is it so hard to yank people out of your life? You’ve got to make that a skill. It is probably one of the most important skills you might need to move forward. 

Deleting people from your life is fine art. Learn it.

And then there’s the ever deluded possibility of being friends. Because people just like to hold on to stuff- hoarding damaged goods of no real value until there’s no space left to fit in true valuables.

What would friendship achieve with someone who couldn’t respect the vulnerabilities that come with intimacy?

S/he’s threadbare in many regard; lacking emotional intelligence or maturity even in its blandest form.

Repairs are time consuming, they get you dirty, and sometimes you realise it’s best to just get a new device.

Your goal should be to make some more money and get a cooler device. Leave all that dirty repairs to people who like to suffer emotionally for the heck of preserving what once was.

You can’t change a wo/man…or in most situations, a girl/boy.

Let them be. They need to play with sand, let them. 

Don’t hand them your priceless jewellery or invite them to dinner with pricey chinaware on display.

Leave people at the corner they need to be at the time they need to be there.

This is a special post to everyone taking care of their responsibilities- a child(ren).

Whether you’z a man or woman, Happy Mother’s Day!
