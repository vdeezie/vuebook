People are going to leave their “clients” (most are just imaginary, anyways)

Leave their children hungry

Leave their life’s assignment hanging

Forget their super-average existence for 48hours…

As they feast on Chimamanda and Elnathan’s issues on Twitter

Meanwhile, Facebook continues living on purpose

Half the time the information isn’t as important as the hustle in front of us here

Don’t give me the American statistics of “how Twitter will make you succeed faster than Facebook”

Let’s build a research peculiar to this environment. I can swear Naija Twitter will make you a big loser- and don't tell me about exceptions. Like how Omojuwa makes N2 million every month from Twitter. He is like a Bobbi Schmurda in a pack of a million broke thugs.

Twitter is breeding a bunch of gossipmongers who forget to remove the log in their own eyes

Such glaring poverty they try to hide with 140 characters

Waiting on the edge of joblessness everyday to find what to tweet about

22 tweets on one subject; responding to someone else’s issues

You can’t be normal.

The culture of Nigerian Twitter is set to make you an intelligent loser, eventually.

Continue at this pace and you'll inherit a bunch of unaccomplished dreams.
