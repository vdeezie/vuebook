Yesterday, we watched Brad Pitt’s ‘Fury’. 

After a profound story had been told, at the bottom of what was left, the Germans- like a colony of ants, were marching through a path where Brad Pitt’s armour tank had broken down, his men trying to fix it so they could continue on a lone journey after his entire army had been wiped off by bullets from the Nazis. He had only three men left.

They heard the march- the thumping sound of soldiers coming that way.

There were trees everywhere, bush hideouts that could have kept them secured. They would have made it there on time before the Germans came any closer. His men beckoned on him…

“Let’s go!” They called.

But he sat on the armour tank, with bags under his eyes; he looked at them and said…

“I am tired.”

He was tired- of running, of strategies that continue to fail, of niceties and subtleties that show calm civility yet embraces colossal ignorance.

“I am tired.”

And with that, they stayed- four of them; and fought over a thousand Germans.

Yes, they died (at least three of them, including Brad Pitt).

Oh! But what a death! 

They killed more than half the number of Nazis that attacked them. All they had was a tank, bullets and discontent.

Our Nigerian contentment is a great evil amongst us. Our contentment is vile; it is a scam.

Stop being content. It is not cute. Yes, you will be crowned as ‘humble’ but you are just…content- like a dog happy to eat shit.

It is content.

Contentment is not for us. Be tired.

Until you get what you want from the bunch of political reps- basic nothings, given freely to people in proper societies, you have no reason for contentment.

Be tired. Die! (It is not physical death).

Die so you can live.
