Broke negroes are the biggest problems of the world. 

Followed by terrorism.

Then religion.

I just read the most hilarious Facebook post a guy composed for a chick who dared to ask to be taken to Mr. Biggs instead of mama put on a first date. Now he is soooo disappointed 'cos homegirl seems like the greedy type.

Mr Biggs. Meatpie. Hot air. Fanta. Greed.

Homeboy is looking for Ms. Right; someone who is willing to struggle with him. Grow into love. Manage with him.

So Mr. Biggs is a huge red flag, yo.

See how these girls miss their luck,  ehn!

The first date should be on a bus, heading from Oshodi to Oworonshoki. There, they can express their affection and plan their future.

Give the conductor N100, and watch her hassle for your change.

Your N20 change.

Then you can sigh out of relief.

Indeed, you have found your missing rib.

Na so.
...

Ladies, repeat after me:

"Broke-ass niggas ain't shit."

Now receive the holy spirit- the proprietrix of wisdom.

Go and sin no more.
