# Rant421



April 5, 2015

The calm streets, as a consequence of a peaceful election, haven’t interpreted very well on social media.

There’s a desperation here- a cultic anxiety that makes you want to bang your head on a wall, maybe a microchip might fall out of one of your ears. Some kind of spellbinding activity of sort.

It is one thing to deal with the “Hail Hitler” mantra…

Another thing entirely when people begin to swear on their lives, their mother’s grave, their children’s future… that Buhari will perform.

I don’t understand that at all. Are you in Tinubu’s head? How can you be so sure as to make such bold declarations of faith and trust on anyone?

You fought for him to win on social media, thankfully he has.

The fight with your social media neighbours should be over, no?

Your job is not to defend Buhari blindly; your job is to ensure that all those weeks of endless war on social media, and hours trying to cast your vote for this man, pays off by holding him responsible for every promise made.

Every single one of them.

Why are you still fighting on social media?

He won. What next?

If he promised to feed primary school children for 4 years; as ridiculous and unnecessary as that is, then we should all ensure he remembers to do that.

Then to other important issues like Boko Haram and economic restoration.

Your man is in, folks! That's it.

I think we just like to fight one another. Now that the impossible happened (an incumbent walking away without bloodshed), we are yet to reset the cantankerous sim card in our brains
…
We still don’t know how to interpret this thing that happened.

Like soldiers who spend all their time at war fronts, finally getting to their victory camp for some celebration and then a long quiet sleep.

That noiselessness afterwards is unsettling. No sounds of bullets; agonizing cries all gone. You have only silence for companionship.

“What is that?” one soldier would ask.

“It is called quiet. Peace.” Someone would respond. 

We don't know what to do with this serenity.
