My older daughter came second in the Common Entrance examination held in school.

I am not one of those parents who worry about top position and why she didn’t clinch first place.

Whether she comes first or tenth, she will succeed.

It is not blind faith. It is vision. It is principle.

Of course it looks good on my ego when I know she is doing very well in school.

My pride feels like luxurious silk when I am told of her impressive scores and exemplary behaviour…

Her excellent grades justify the fees, and drives me to work harder so I can reward her for being bright.

But I don’t lose sleep over it.

I would rather have an average child who will go into life with the right principles, than have a genius who thinks the world owes her something.

The world owes you nothing.

And nobody’s light has to be dim just so we can see how bright yours can shine.

The genius curse (and I use that word “genius” loosely…many are just one ice-cream topping better than the rest) is one that expects everyone to stop breathing so they can live.

They question everyone’s success and conclude that the world is a jealous little ball deliberately trying to stop them from winning.

Imagine when you have to pass that on to a child.

The world is a market place. Throw your wares on the floor and start the bargain!

My younger daughter is fond of home life and chores. She likes to watch me cook, likes to wash, likes to sweep and would turn up first if I needed something done.

She hates reading. Struggles through her Enid Blyton series and gets bored with literature…

Thankfully, she understands this is work and, "whether I like it or not I have to do my homework, pass my exams and do well," she would say. 

Even though she’d rather try her hands on frying an omelette, she still works hard enough to maintain a top five position.

Of course, I am going to keep pushing her to read regardless.

But deep down, it bothers me not.

She will succeed.

It is vision. It is principle.

Let us not talk about luck yet. Or maybe we should

That term we try to use to disparage other people’s success.

Luck is when a business man bumps into Adenuga on a lift, holds a 15 second conversation that catches the man’s interest... he requests for his card…which would follow with a few calls and an agreement to supply Glo with optic fibre…

Adenuga uses the damn lift every time, and he obviously meets young men in there everyday; geniuses even.

So why should we summarise an average man’s smart decision with the same measure of a genius’ inaction. 

Why should the average man’s success and his fancy Porsche be summed up as luck? Who then is a genius?

The one who has all the figures and logarithms in his head yet cannot get passed an average life OR the one who can't solve a damn Maths but creates ideas and makes smart elevator moves? 

Luck? Indeed.

The real geniuses of this world are average people who make ingenious choices.  

What stays in your head is yours to keep, society can only celebrate and reward what we execute.

Average people execute. 

So I am happy my older daughter shows signs of being super smart…and I am happy my younger daughter loves domestic life…

When the time comes, we will keep all of that in the closet and talk about real life expectations.

These expectations and our sense of entitlements. 

If you think you are that good yet you cannot promote your personal brand…

You will become a genius with “baby issues”- expecting the world to breastfeed you when you cry, sulking at every turn, weighing your talent against the others’…

And generally being a disgruntled person with major identity crisis.
