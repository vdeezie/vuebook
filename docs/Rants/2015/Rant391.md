Let’s talk about this for a minute. I get many calls, people wanting to leave good jobs to become writers.

It’s flattering that you’d consider our industry cool enough for you to (want to) give up so much for it.

But how practical is this move?

If your sole goal is to become an author or a columnist, I can assure you that you will starve- a biting hunger that will make you dizzy for years.

The writers who succeed are scriptwriters, because that industry is ripe, and it is linked directly to one of the biggest thriving industries in Nigeria- Nollywood. There’s a lot of tinsel (pun intended) attached to gigs associated with writing scripts. 

The most successful writer I know, is a scriptwriter; and she is a crisp millionaire. 

So if you want to leave your architectural job for writing, you might want to ensure you are going into the right genre. Authors have street cred, but no money. Your primary aim is to eat, no?

And then there are versatile writers who can do just about anything- edit magazines, build content for blogs, write for TV and breakfast shows, script for movies or plays, write proposals, books, ghost writing, create publicity drafts for dignitaries etc.

If you are a versatile writer and you have the energy of a bull, you will succeed and make this writing thing look like a piece of cake.

But it is not.

There are no guarantees you will find happiness out of a pay job. So why don’t you keep that job and do your writing by night?

There are no ready structures for success in Nigeria away from a 9-5; some of us have to listen to a Joyce Meyer tape, for instance, every morning before we can muster the courage to start our day. Not everyone can deal with that much pressure. You have to be built for it.

If you are not, don’t do it.

And please note: most of the people you will deal with as a writer are sole business owners or celebrities, they don’t have as much money as you think. Forget the SUVs. There’s no money (you should know that by now- with a few million naira always standing between them and their deaths).

So yes, you want to leave a N500k job to become a literary appendage to a musician or an actor… you will run their errands for weeks (a friend of mine was buying amala for her musician client forever), and then you might be told to wait for an endorsement to come through before your salary is paid (even though they stay flossing on social media); it’s a whole new ball of misery for you. Then your head begins to flog you, "you should have just kept your day job".

So wait. Think. Relax. And think again before you let go of that job.

There are doctors and lawyers who are great writers. They multitask well. 

Maybe you just need to learn how to multitask.
