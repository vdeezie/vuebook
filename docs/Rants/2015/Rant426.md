Why are Yourbas apologising from all corners of the earth?

I don’t understand.

From McDonald’s kitchen to cranky motel receptions in Sweden, the apologies are streaming in from Yorubas of all shapes and hues.

Why?

Is this an ethnic issue?

No.

It is one man’s foolishness, and he just happens to be an Oba- Yoruba royalty.

When it happened, I didn’t think of it as an ethnic crime of a people…

One old moron is already drunk with liquor that he anticipates from a new dispensation. 

His greed, pushing him from behind, took a jab in his anus- quick anal sex.

Sore anus.

Liquor.

Madness.

How can that be an ethnic issue?

If I ever felt tribalism play out in this tragic soap opera, it was actually when the apologies started flowing in.

All the incoherent babble…

“Forgive US…”

“WE are sorry”

“OUR culture is not like that”

Your apologies are patronising and condescending. There’s a superior ring to it that shows a clear distinction between you and “them”.

So stop it.

You should be shocked- just shocked by it all.

That’s all.

The despicable utterances of a man in a traditional position of reverence should crush you and leave you just as upset or dumbfounded as the rest of us.

That’s all.

The need to rise up and give apologies- from under Eko bridge, to offices stashed in Ikorodu, to cabs in Germany- because you are Yoruba, makes this a tad bit annoying and, yes, haughty.

All the tribalism I see is in this tirade of “sorrys" used as soap and water on the Igbos.

The only person who is in need of pity and “compassion” is the man himself- that old age has left him this foolish is a sad thing.

This is how we burden ourselves.

Soon, you shall all be making apologies for Buhari…

Since you have made your oaths on social media and sworn with the left eye of your unborn children that he will perform.

Get ready.

This thing go do you like film trick.
