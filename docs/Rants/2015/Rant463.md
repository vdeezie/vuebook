I got a mail:

“Hi Joy, are women not supposed to help one another financially? What if a woman has immediate financial needs and reaches out to another woman for help? Shouldn’t she assist as soon as she can? Empowering the woman financially should be a good approach to breaking strongholds of patriarchy, no? Please I really need to know what you think.”

Here's my take:

Fixing another woman’s immediate financial need does not empower her or her children. It is charity at best, and that too is commendable. 

However, handouts do not Empower.  It will solve the "food problem" at the moment, but it will not give you the requisite knowledge to live above that situation.

So there’s every guarantee that you’ll be back to seeking another loaf of bread. And that is not why we are here. If that is what we need to solve then we do not need to form strong alliances that are built to Empower. All we need to do is keep giving the woman fish to eat.

I think we are always too quick to wear the robe of the victim. We strip ourselves of power too soon in many situations.

We need to learn how to fight patriarchy. Don’t just mope, fight. Attack the system that allows another human being more options than you. Confront the society that gives the other superior choices/opportunities.

Don’t cower. 

Don’t beg just yet.

Ask for solutions. Seek methods to live better than a dog.

Our first decision should not be to ask for fish.

Let us leave that to the very poor in society. They are the ones who need fish every time their tummy  rumbles. Sincerely you'd need special genius to deal with that sect. One I do not have. So I focus on my kind.

Our interest and focus, at the moment, is on the educated, fairly enlightened city-driven woman.

Woman, you cannot live from hand-to-mouth. This movement cannot feed your immediate needs.

Find answers to your immediate needs first before plunging into this arduous task of changing society.

For instance, it makes no sense to allow an educated man off the hook so easily because he woke up from the wrong side of the bed and refuses to take up his responsibility as a husband and father.

Your first option is not to ask for financial help from the next woman. Do you know what others are going through? Your first 10 options should focus on FIGHTING for your child’s right and your dignity.

There are solutions everywhere in the state; we have refused to use the pro-woman system available. And even if there are none, YOU can create that solution. YOU can become the first person to question the law that disfavours your gender and position. YOU can start a whole new chapter of change and empowerment for women of your kind.

Do not let patriarchy turn you into a victim too soon.

I said this one time, and the people in the room couldn’t find the words to respond:

"If I had N100k, I will hold a seminar and empower a dozen women. I will not give it to one woman to solve her immediate need."

A woman failed at suicide in Kenya. She was going to kill herself because she couldn't pay her children’s fees. 

These things don’t happen without a back story. Surely there must have been an uncle who has been taking care of the kids; family burdened with the chore of paying your children’s fees; friends troubled with your constant plea for help.

You cannot sustain anything on that lifestyle. One day everybody is going to get tired of helping you with your fees and face their own lives.

Then you get tired and decide to jump off a cliff- and fail at that too!

-Because you are not empowered. You cannot think beyond a few naira notes.

Woman, you are poor.

You continue to make patriarchy proud of your deprived state.

Think about it.
