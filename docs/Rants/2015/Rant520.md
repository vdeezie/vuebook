I asked one of my writers to take a walk round the bend of Victoria Island where hawkers stand in traffic, selling everything...

Question: How do Nigerians survive hawking wares as random as, say, padlocks?!

How many people would want to buy a padlock on a Maryland traffic stretch, for instance?

Men with families selling padlocks; their wives selling sweets and eraser; their children selling “pure water”. What net profit would that come to at the end of the month?

N8,000 or less? What do you do with money of that sort in a world of this sort?

Yesterday, during an EbonyLife interview, the presenter asked me the one thing nobody prepared me for.

My answer was right at the tip of my tongue: “Poverty”.

And as much as my mother and brother, especially, drummed it into my head that building a healthy relationship with money is important, I had to experience it first hand to believe.

And for one who has been there, I will tell you without pretence… 

I do not believe people can be poor and be happy at the same time. They are mutually exclusive. Unless, of course, one was once rich and it gave them constant headache- this affluence. But not to have experienced wealth... it is impossible to quantify lack on the same scale of emotion with abundance.

The world is 100% materialistic; if you doubt that, try not to make money for one month, watch your children’s knickers grow a big hole exposing black buttocks…
Try, in that circumstance, to keep a smile.

If you pass this litmus test, then it is not poverty that keeps you happy; it is your final resignation to poverty; accepting that there is no other life known to you... that position, in itself, is satisfying.

Humans can get used to anything. 

Women get used to abusive spouses. They get a slap at night, and in the morning they are singing choruses and trying to make their (single) neighbours jealous, by washing a drum of "daddy’s clothes" in front of the house.

That is the life they have accepted. And for some reason, it is the life they believe every other woman should be envious of. It is resignation caused by myopia. That, in itself, can become satisfying.

Your contentment with average comes with the fact that you do not have any other experience to compare with.

That is why ‘drive’ is a special thing. People who are driven are never content. And I know they tell you it is 'not good for one not to be content'. 

Leave all that matter for Mathias, abeg. Be driven. Period.

It is that which drives you that offers you more.

Here is a young boy, barely 13…

His smile is everything; it comes from the heart.

Yet I am angry with his parents. No matter how much they have taught him to “smile through all circumstances”... no matter how many scripture verses they have shared to back the beauty in living the simple life...

They are wrong. They will always be wrong. They didn’t fight hard enough to give him a better life.

"But Joy how do you know they didn't fight hard enough? Why judge?"

They didn't, damn it. If they did, he wouldn't be out here selling kpankere.

Ps: you’ll find the little girl, barely 5, with a big basket of dried fish on her head if you click the link. “Mummy put it on my head,” she said.

That, too, has no scripture or contentment verse that should save it.
