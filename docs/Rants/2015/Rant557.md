# Rant557


September 27, 2015

So the summary of the last few days of anti-feminism outrage asking that we trim our voices to a thin sheet of scarf for delicate purposes- like an accessory around our necks or wrists, is that:

We have not achieved anything. 

We should enter the field. 

-Because as far as this particular writer is concerned, achievement is only when we can stand by market squares and hand out fliers and pamphlets; maybe even share goodies.

Why?

-Because it seems our Conversation in cosy arenas is affecting climate change. Frail egos are pained, jealousy is sprouting from every hole, envy has turned blood to green (don't lie, you are a ball of envy)

They have expectations. 

Why?

It is the Nigerian problem. You sit somewhere and expect someone to fix it. You want it fixed but you can’t seem to get up from your stool.

#TheConversation started in May.

Yes, I know it looks like it has been around for longer, because, well, we do these things phenomenally.

But it is just 4 months old.

In 4 months, we have moved around a bit- from Lagos, to Abuja, to Ibadan, and back to Lagos,

At the 4th edition of the event, we launched #50K4BIZ, a project that empowers small businesses owned by women.

N150,000 has been invested into three small businesses owned by women.

Happy recipients of #50K4BIZ- Chibuzor Mirian Azubuike, Funmilayo Oladimeji, and Bisoye, a 300L Unilag student running her own catering business, will disagree with you.

Yet after 4 months, and after your envy has turned you into a swollen sore, I have to listen to arguments like…

Go into the field.

Christians are in the field, see the nasty work they do for Christ. See how despised they are (do not mistake that for the gospel), see how shamefully they package the Word of God. Even Christ is begging that they retreat and strategize.

Every relationship is built on communication. Talk is important. 

Conversation comes first.

TedX is how old? Yet they are still talking- from NewYork to Oshodi. 

Conferences are designed to promote talk.

Nations go to war because communication is faulty. 

One small talk with Helen of Troy and Menelaus, and Trojans wouldn’t have been destroyed by Greeks.

Talk.

Pray tell, mother of conspiracy, who made you the time-keeper of Talk?

Do you need women with no understanding of patriarchy to “enter the field” and share their ignorance with other ignorant people? To prove what? That we are “working”… like Fayose?

The women and men who come to these cosy arenas to attend #TheConversation are thirsty for knowledge. Shall we not first understand this Patriarchy before we become teachers of equality?

Before we carry our heads into the market and preach?

4 months later, you have a spreadsheet of expectations from feminists. Yet, you are a non-feminist. An obsession that you hope might hide your own inadequacies.

Maybe if you pile it up on someone else’s door, nobody will notice the cracks on yours.

This is the kind of confusion that runs through many lives.

I am not in a happy union, but I do not believe in divorce.
I am divorced but I do not believe in equality.
I believe women should find equality but I don’t think they should fight patriarchy 
I think women can be astronauts but they should always return home every night to make dinner
I think feminists can be angry about child rape, but they should not show it. It will scare people away.
I think Twitter is cool but it should be called Whittle

You think. You think. You think.

Time is running out on all your thoughts.

If we are not doing what you have assigned yourself as a jury to pass a verdict on…then enter the field and do what you want to see happen.

These things are not hard.

Do not condemn a programme that fills halls every time it is held. It shows even the upwardly mobile man and woman is hungry for knowledge. They want to know more about patriarchy and sexism. They want to know how to treat their spouses better, how to train their children better.

People come to unburden. Even when they come in a Range Rover. What? The Mercedes madam does not deserve a feminist event that speaks to her needs? Everything has to be rural the minute it is born? These delusions.

Are we supposed to leave them and enter market squares? To prove what nah?

Who will reach out to the market women eventually? Who will talk to their cooks and housemaids? Who will tell their gate men not to have too many children they cannot take care of? Who will teach their drivers to stop pushing their daughters into sex slavery? Who will tell the cleaner not to marry her 14 year old daughter off to a 70 year old polygamist?

These ones, will they not first get the knowledge we need them to share to a larger population?

See how I have to explain these things to you like I would to a toddler.

I disregard all your expectations. 

You do not have the copyright to achievement, to methods, to happiness.

Because frankly, you have not achieved anything yourself.

I do not think about growth or radicalism in a way that changes society, and tick your name as the answer.
.
You do not inspire me in the least. And I do not inspire you.

With that in mind, I’m sure we can carry on with our business-You promoting non-feminism, and me smashing glass ceilings of patriarchy.

And for dessert.. here's a picture of me dancing Shoki.

You can slide beneath my hand- down to that mediocre height.

PS: Another cosy event today! *woot* It's the launch of Happenings magazine. I'll be off here for hours. See ya!
