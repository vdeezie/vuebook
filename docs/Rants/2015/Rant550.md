Mothers…

Do not leave your children with your neighbours.

Do not place your child in the front seat on an okada, away from your gaze

Don’t approve private tutorials without supervision with a male teacher

Do not permit any pastor to carry out any kind of deliverance on your daughter

Extended family members are largely strangers. Your father’s uncle’s wife’s son is a stranger; do not let him into your home where you are raising girls

Encourage your daughter to talk about the journey to-and-from school everyday; know the activities of the driver who brings her home- what kind of music does he listen to in the car/bus? What kind of conversation, calls does he have? Mannerisms etc.

Single mums, if you have a boyfriend… dude is dating you not your kid. What’s with all the bloody introductions. Does she need to know who mum is hanging out with? Take your man-business away from your kid. They don’t need to meet anyone. Like seriously, not one. Unless you plan to remarry and all dat headache.

Married mums, if your daughter ever complains about her father, don’t shut her up. Act. Report to the police. And let all the relatives who try to talk you out of it burn in hell.

A vagina is a vagina. A penis is a penis. No pet names. Call it what it is. Let your children identify properly with their body parts.

Rape is mostly caused by men, not ghosts. 

Unless you can vouch for the character of the men in your life, do not leave your daughter unsupervised with anyone.

We can reduce cases of child rape. Truly, we can. It is not rocket science - watch the people around your children.

Child rape is as a result of trust. If you kill the trust, there’ll be very few cracks to worry about.

Build your child’s suspicion. Caution is not such a bad thing. Paranoia in 2015 can save your life.

Not all men are rapists, but the numbers are alarming. Let us stop acting like we don't know how bad it is.

A scientist stated two out of five men (or so) are potential paedophiles.

Choirmasters raping minors.

Step brothers sexually assaulting sisters.

Father molesting daughter.

Uncle abusing niece.

Landlord molesting tenant's 5 year old.

Teacher sleeping with student.

Another day, another rape tale *sigh*

Mothers, protect your children with all your wealth,or all your lack.

PS: This is NOT the post to remind us that there are still some great guys in the world. We know. It still hasn't solved child rape.

Let every man live with his own knowing.
