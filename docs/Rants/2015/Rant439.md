*coughs*

So my partner tells me there's a picture of his ex in one of my album of events. 

Me and her smiling.

He assures me she is not my friend, just someone who showed up at one of my events, and who admires my work. (It eez well)

I have told him to show me the picture, but he has refused kwa!

I would like to know so I can call to praise her good taste (*ahem), take her out for lunch and talk about his penis. 

*flees*

It is midnight,  go to bed!
