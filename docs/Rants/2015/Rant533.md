There's this picture of the step-by-step process of how a child is delivered circulating social media.

There, the vagina shows off its true potential.

All well and good.

But what I don't understand are the memes inspired by that picture. 

"Men, this is what women go through to show love. Respect them."

"People, this is what mother's experience, please salute your mother."

I have two kids, I know labour is no beans. 

However, mad women, with no sense of direction, go through the same delivery process too.

Sociopaths who watch stepfather's rape their children and still remain with them... those who refuse to prosecute a molester disguised as an uncle...mothers who transfer the aggression and desperation of lost love on their children...and those who despise the child because of similar features s/he shares with a man who used her like a napkin...

All experience the same vagina expansion and retraction of childbirth. 

Any process that can produce over 7 billion people is trite and unspectacular at best.

I'm sorry. I am not feeling that whole campaign. It's patronising in a way that leaves my skin crawling with rashes.

See ehn, this thing is simple. A woman does not need to give birth or go through labour to be treated right.

The world does not need to be reminded of the process of childbirth to gain love and respect for women.

I am a human being and I demand respect. Period. 

It is that simple. Forget about "the pain of the woman", "the depth of a woman's love", "the sacrifices of the African goddess."

Forget all of that; they are actually denigrating. Yes.

Just respect the fact that I don't beg you for money, you don't pay my bills...respect the fact that I have my career on a lock down...recognise that I take care of all my responsibilities without wavering.

Respect the next human being living a decent life.

All sentiments are unecessary and patronising. These memes continue to reduce the woman to a piece of object that needs to be adored after wiping off dirt.

That's how I see it.
