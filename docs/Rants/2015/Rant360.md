PDP has no presence on social media; I hope this means they are in villages gaining the confidences of the electorates.

Nonetheless, the annoying, pretentious lower middle class with a meal-ticket-at-the-Hilton-stuck-on-his-sleeve-as-a-badge-of-honour littered all over social media like garbage, is still an important piece of puzzle in the game of politics.

How a ruling party fails to respond when it is most necessary or reacts at the right hour is a problem that has persisted for so long it has become like menstruation- trickling down a woman’s thigh. It smells bad, it looks bad.

This silence on social media that is usually interrupted with on-and-off profanity from The President’s media aides, after drinking petrol to a state of stupor, is what irks me the most.

Do we even matter? Or are we just tools for amusement to that lot whenever they feel like teasing a group of people.

“Go and torment those jobless suckers on twitter; I need some comedy, I am high on diesel,” Okupe might say.

Then he pronounces GEJ “Jesus” and waits… if it was just Facebook, of course, nobody cares; but twitter falls for this trap every single time, with a million angry veins sticking out of necks.

“Pluck one vein from the lot and use it to pump fuel into my SUV.”

Laughter. Jollity.

A few back and forth tweets. Wank. Wank. Jerk. Groan. Cum.

They win. You don’t matter.

You are still broke. Cum shots all over your poverty.

You don’t matter. Especially those on twitter. 

They are counting on the millions without internet; those who have never heard of Linkedin; can’t spell ‘Tweet’; thinks Zuckerberg is the name of a place they’d never be able to visit.

Because any silence caked into such solid mass of nonchalance and insouciance, must have its own agenda.

Like when a man is foolish and he keeps quiet and it is counted to his benefit as wisdom.

Something like that.
