# Rant349


January 11 2015

So Toyosi Akerele Ogunsiji “spoke against” Jonathan a year or two ago (most likely focusing on certain structures and policies she does not agree with) and now she’s on the list of GEJ campaign, and that demonstrates public betrayal as summarised on social media?

People are berating her like they have a parallel system where change can happen.

The best way to create change is to be part of the process. You don’t get change waking up every morning and logging on to Twitter; that is not where change resides- you are just looking for amusement. Change is being a part of the structure and adding your voice, getting heard.

Activism is not always about sitting in the rain (that’s cool), but real results happen when you enter into the system to become a voice that can effect the changes you want.

What is she supposed to do? Continue complaining like we all do on social media and gather unnecessary enemies? You have all turned against yourselves, meanwhile Obasanjo is dancing and taking selfies with GEJ at his daughter’s wedding. 
This is how politicians are! FFK moves back and forth from APC to PDP at will, Atiku camps wherever his fat pocket can pay, Dele Momodu changes his mind when it’s convenient. Politics is akin to prostitution, and you are all here fighting at the entrance of a brothel arguing who is going to be fucking who when all the action and orgies and orgasms are taking place inside- beyond your reach.

You see why you need to get off social media? This shit is affecting your brain.

How can anyone speak against Toyosi being on a campaign list? How is she going to influence government policies- some of which she may have complained about- if she doesn’t get involved, add to the structures where decisions are formed?

If YOU had the opportunity to join any of the campaign, will you not explore that possibility to see just maybe you can finally make the changes on the corridors where your voices will echo louder than the 1.5megabits internet on your phone? Abi you think we are unaware of your 2kobo per tweet ambition?

When you speak “against” someone, it doesn’t mean you have to support his opposition. Gosh! No! GMB? Hell NO!

If your issues are constructive it could pave way for your contribution to the system, not turn you into an enemy.

I know this kind of talk offends the average Nigerian, but I am not sorry- Toyosi’s professional pedigree puts her above and ahead of all this rant. 

She was asked, she was yet to give an answer, but they believed in her merit anyways and added her, even before she got back to them. Leadership is desperate for value. She adds value. Toyosi's influence is not in a paltry 10,000 active twitter users, she will rally the entire youths in the grassroots' level- from Ekiti to Ibadan to Akure to Shangisha.
