“How many times I gotta tell that bitch to come over?
 I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
 You know how a nigga feel 'bout wastin' time
 You know how I feel about waitin' in line
 You know he ain't it, girl you're wastin' your time
 You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
 How many times I gotta tell that bitch to come over?
 How many times I gotta tell that bitch to come over?
 How many times I gotta tell that bitch to come over?
 I'll fuck you right, have you walkin' from side to side
 How many times…” 

– DJ Khaled featuring Chris Brown, Big Sean and Lil Wayne

This song was playing  by 3pm on the radio today. Of course they have the cheesy method of censoring “bitch” and “fuck” in a mute second. 

But teenagers can fill in the blanks. Pre-teens, even.

They know it’s either “fuck” or “bitch” or “ass” when that cut happens.

The beat is good. If you are into hip-hop, that is. So they are going to be loving it and singing all the way to depravity.

Yet this is not an immediate problem for our society to deal with.

“Let parents take care of their kids while we rape the world of its last morality,” society seems to be saying.

Countless times I have caught early teens engaging in deep throat kissing on Disney Channel.

Is that not supposed to be for children? Is 3pm not a good time for kids to turn on their radio?

These questions are treated like a rash when you bring them up at forums. People fluff over it and wave it off. Let the parents deal with their issues. 

Should parents pack up their lives and become paranoid over every word that isn’t supposed to make it to daytime broadcast?

Still this is not as urgent as the need for adults to legislate penis-and-vagina issues.

We are grooming a generation with no moral compass or benchmark.

This thing worries me.
