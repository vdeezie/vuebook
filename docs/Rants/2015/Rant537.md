We are well within our rights to get upset with Access Bank’s ample sexist Ad copy.

But Access bank didn’t annoy me half as much as Ndani TV 'Juice' with Toolz, sponsored by GTB.

At the end of season one of the show, Toolz was cut into small pieces of sexual material for all, in a contest with Omotola to see who could win the- as you guessed- Most Bootylicious.

So trite. So ridiculous.  Dreadfully unnecessary.

Toolz is stroking her own body- hips and thighs, a brush of her breasts, waist and belly.

“Mirror, Mirror on the wall…” cries Omotola.

Outraged by Toolz’s  “beauty”, Omotola groans in frustration.

Toolz has bigger buttocks, fuller breasts, thicker thighs.

What are we celebrating? Toolz’s body for the gratification of men. And women.

This is a presenter who, it seemed, changed the way we listen to radio.

Toolz turned her slot to the hottest hour on radio- not primetime belt, yet she  made it work. Stuck with the  most frustrating  hours, tougher to get people’s attention,  cosmopolitan  Lagos’ most productive hours of 12pm-4pm… 

YET Toolz  turned the tables and made her show the most celebrated on radio for a chunk of years.

She was one of the go-to voices for entertainment at some point… 

I think a woman like that doesn’t need to be reminded of her anatomy in a way that allows us see her as plain meat on a plate.

If a pole was close, GTB might suggest she climbed, hitting her bum like a bag of sachet water for good effect.

Get wet. Literally  and figuratively.

As far as I see, Access bank was  just a little too excited with their women empowerment ambitions. Excitement makes you act stupid.

To think that their audience are upwardly mobile women… you’d  wonder who  then  they are hoping to reach with that copy: “a woman is creative when she prepares great meals out of little ingredients”

LMAO!  I can’t even  get upset.  It’s really  just a  team too excited, they ran  into the streets with only their boxers on.

However, GTB Ndani TV 'Juice' and  it's sexist undertone reminds us that women will always be valued for attractiveness rather than talent.
