Warning: This is a spiritual post

The human being is designed to worry.

Worry is a multimillion naira depleting business that we can’t seem to get out of.

We worry when we are happy, we worry when we are sad. We worry the weather will get too hot and we’d sweat from our eyelashes, we worry that harmattan will crack our lips.

We worry in and out of every situation. It’s not just a sport, it’s a fulltime business with no income or profit attached to it.

-Because it is such an active emotion with solid structures and “employees” (demons) working day and night to ensure business continues and you constantly lose money, even when there’s absolutely nothing to worry about, we still worry. We have been programmed to run this worry business even after filing for bankruptcy.

That is how destructive it is. Yet there’s no end to it for the human being.

The richest man in the world will still find something to worry about. The most admired, well-loved personalities commit suicide out of worry and clinical depression etc.

So what hope does the average human have?

Worry comes and we don’t even know what we worry about.

It’s just there- Worry. With no purpose. Just an annoying part of life’s business that has refused to grow up and “get a life”.

That’s Worry. It has built a fancy structure and “business” must go on.

I took a minute to reflect on it.

If God is going to work overtime on your requests then worry just stands in the way of everything.

If, for instance, you ask for Peace, He has made it available. But you don’t have it because Worry shades the hell out of everything else.

Unless it’s a tragic situation, most of our Worry should be traded for dry wit. 

Humour or sarcasm works, most of the time.
