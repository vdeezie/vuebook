A dinner date that drowned in my Smirnoff Ice, went thus:

"Joy, you are pretty. Why do you need to be a feminist? Isn't that reserved for ugly women who can't get a man to pay them any attention?"

I almost choked on my chicken.

I know there is a lot of unlearning to do, but for someone who has traveled wide and has a degree in almost every city...

No. That was unpardonable.

But it opened my eyes to the reason many women do not want to be called feminists. 

You already struggle with being average, then someone throws that feminist robe on you, taking away the last shred of "pretty" you can hold on to...

You are going to stand on the mountain top and proclaim you still have pretty lips, wide hips, a semblance of smooth light skin when you open your palms...

You are no feminist. God forbid.

If we are not lesbians. Ugly. Sexually frustrated. Men haters... we are trying to disrupt the way life should be where women should stay bent over a kitchen board.

I don't know what these people are on about...

I am pretty. Black skin that glows like the sun. My legs go on for days. My dimples are the ish. Have you seen me in a short dress? My curls are made for gods. My voice is a sweet sounding...err...tambourine. 

And that's just the physical parts. Should I tell you about my intrinsic nature to win every project I touch? My drive that surpasses the ambition of ten thousand people?

Should I go on about my fabulousness?

Yet I am a Feminist with a capital "F". One who still gets the attention of the finest male species; brewed with the finest skills of chivalry.

Educate yourselves, people.
