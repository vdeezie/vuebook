Dear Nigerians,

We cannot sit and discuss violence like a new automobile in town. We cannot have long conversations on "what ifs".

"What if she was rude and he had to slam the hot iron on her face..."

"What if she didn't obey him and it made him punch her in the eye..."

We can't have round table discussions over tea on these type of issues and come up with fancy words to soothe our worries. It's just not something I can deal with.

Save your negotiations for whether you need to buy a red boxers or a green one. 

Violence cannot be presented with the same tone as... "Should we have coconut rice or soggy beans?" 

Where is your sense of rage? Shall we keep flipping our weaves when women are made to choke on their own engagement rings?

Don't try to reason it out. Don't try to see it in a different light. Don't try to balance the situation. Don't try to tolerate or weigh varied opinions on the subject of Violence.

We can't spend our time holding cerebral discourse on Nigeria's fuel crisis with bogus words and crisp theories...and think it sane to address violence with such finesse.

"Fork on the left. Knife to the right. Now can we talk about the man who sliced off his wife's breasts?"

Tradition is messing with our sense of rage.

A man punches his wife, she bleeds from every hole, and Nigerian families- worn uncles and kinsmen want to sit over palmwine and...DISCUSS THE ISSUE.

"Why did he hit her? What must be done so she doesn't provoke him to hit her again? Who should move in to the house so they can monitor the mouth of the wife? Where can we get the cheapest treatment so he doesn't waste his money treating a small wound..."

If you present violence over a glass of wine, you will soon find something to laugh about...

You'll notice how cute one person's nose is... how he drools on his words... the colour of her shoes. 

You trivialise a sorry issue when Violence is made to wear a dress- make it presentable and civil. 

I'm sorry, but you are a pervert.

There's nothing civil about Violence.

Save your decorum for a ball.

We will attack this issue with ashes on our heads.
