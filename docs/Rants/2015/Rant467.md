When I woke up to find that my car had been embossed with sketches made from rusted corks…

I did not say a word to my neighbours. I took my car away from harm. I found another parking space. The distance is annoying. But I am aiming for peace. Whatever its short-term benefits are.

I have a right to park my car in front of my apartment without confronting a family with wild offspring, and getting into a typical fight where I have to remind the parents to bring up civil children. It is not a myth, children can be orderly.

And they, in turn, would have to bemoan my audacities. How rude I am, “speaking to my husband anyhow”.

I just saved us all World War J.

It is tedious to fight some people.

I refuse to have conversation or arguments with a woman who will not put a pair of slippers on her tots, yet allow them roam untamed around the ‘hood, picking up corks and turning cars to boards.

There is nothing I would say that she could possibly understand. You have to come with a certain kind of panache to engage my anger. 

And that clearly is the point.

Your fierce polemics must come as a smorgasbord of wit. There’s no point trying to be nasty if you cannot keep up with the rhythm- it changes every second. You must dance until it stops.

If you can’t, don’t play devil’s advocate. You are a bad bad actress.

You are not smart. You are an irritant. 

Your predilection for tasteless remarks is amusing in the same way a child tries to reach the top of the shelf. You just smile. It is only a child. You will ignore, until the kid baths itself with a tin of Bournvita from the third row. Then it has earned some good spanking.

Dilettantes are only cute when they recognise their boundaries.

If you don’t create that boundary then don’t get mad when you are slammed by a truck.

Clearly I am not talking about a neighbour whose kids cannot keep their corks away from my car anymore.

I am talking about Women and shit I will not accept.

I am tired of having acquaintances. 

The acquaintance is a quixotic project. The precincts are thinly labelled. It is easily abused.

Except you have business- money business for me… you are either a friend or an enemy.

I am tired of idiotic women all up in my space trying to see if they can practice their newly acquired wit on me- something they purchased for ‘okrika’ price at Ojuelegba market.

Let me make that very clear. If I want aimless banter I will be on twitter where neighbours knock on doors to request for salt or butter. On Facebook, we build deliberate alliances. We control our space and the people we allow in.

So if you are an enemy or you feel you should be one, hit the block button now. If you come on my wall trying to sound clever and cheesy, I will give you a punch that will damage your sight.

If you are a friend, then let’s keep this civil- respect yourself.

What would that entail? Common sense.

When someone approaches you to be part of a vision, show some bloody enthusiasm. If it is beneath you to be thrilled, then don’t fucking make me spend money on your conceit. I hate that I have to question if someone is a friend or an idiot. 

If I have ever approached you for comments on my work, and you could not share it with me privately and support my efforts, then eat that shit. Gaily coming out one sunny morning, hundred years later, that you woke up half a bastard to a public space to shade my effort, is the meanest, ugliest attitude a woman can ever wear.

From where I stand you are a lugubrious fool. 

It would be better if you were an enemy. Please be an enemy and hit the block button.

I will not have pretentious women living around the edges of my life. Be gone.

Patriarchy has devoured half of your brain.

Women, whether you accept it or not, remain their own worst headache.
