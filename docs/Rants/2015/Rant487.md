On the subject of submission, I'm not done yet.

When the Word was conceived, men went to war.

David, for instance, fought all his life. He spent his entire life protecting his territory. 

Their ambition was to fight to keep their women from being raped and their children from slavery.

Jonathan (not your president) held a sword fighting for days; it took special care to disengage his palm from the grip of that sword. He killed all men. He was a success.

That dude slaughtered the highest number of enemies in the bible. 

Now if a man's job is to ensure the territory of his family is constantly secure; if he fights so you can earn your dignity as a woman and not even think of compromising your virtue...

If a man fights so his children can have a secure home, a future and happiness...

If a man wakes up everyday and his job is to head to the battle field to kill every obstacle that stands between peace/joy and his family...

By all means submit to that man.

Understand first what the lives of men like David were...

He was a verb.

You enter the battle field without any assurance you'll make it out alive.

Everyday, real men die to protect their country and their homes.

Cowardice was a sin.

So every time he comes back alive, you know you have been saved from slavery. A man puts himself in harm's way just so a woman can be safe.

That is the job of a man. Submission is meant for that kind.

That is the Jesus love that was required for men to live. Only the Jesus kind of love- of constant death and sacrifice of self for the other was deserving of submission. For that love ensures you stay alive and safe.

Welcome to the new era of technology. Civilisation allows women as much oportunities as men.

So in the battlefield, both men and women are fighting to protect their territories, their dignity. It is no longer the exclusive duty of the man.

The new era encourages partnerships; everybody is equal.

Women did not go to war in the days of the Bible, men did (except Deborah). They sacrificed all. They wake up and they don't back down until the last enemy has a slice to the throat. 

These days, we have men who push their children and wives to the door when there's a strange knock.

Back then, men surrendered their heads for their honour; one warrior will ask to die so the others can return to their homes. 

Men were verbs.

It is only fitting for a man who dies everyday to have someone call him "lord" and scrub his back and ego. 

Not now. Not in 2015.

The most heroic act of some men is paying rent or school fees.

Many can't even afford to give their family the kind of life they should have.

You fix the bulb, change the car tyres...then you spend half your time badgering a woman to submit.

Your wife is now your partner. Not your subordinate. You are equal, because she gives just as much. You may not even be able to run your home without her income.

Look at all of us, nobody is speaking out about the injustices we face everyday in this country. Men shy away from protests, from having an opinion, from war.

All your braggadocio starts and ends on social media.

David and co will be rolling in their graves.

How men sit on social media arguing stupid points. Nigeria will fall and men will sit writing witty comments, arguing with women, allowing their penis to shrink to the size of a bean seed.

And you think it is fitting to demand submission from another human being?

God is bored, else he would have instructed someone to rewrite a few pages of the Bible.

Myles Munroe was getting there; but God didn't think He should be around any longer... 

Lest your eyes be open. 

So He leaves you with all these jokers who call themselves pastors. 

-Because we deserve them.

You can't spend your time on a regular job or business- activities also practised, even better, by women, and expect to be catered for like a lord.

You are no lord. 

You are a struggling noun. 

You need some fire in your belly, not submission from a woman.
