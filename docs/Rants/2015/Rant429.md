One of the best things that can ever happen to you is to conquer the fear of numbers.

As long as it has anything to do with Nigerians, numbers are pathetic.

So when they go on and on and on about how they are going to deal with you...

Rest assured that is the only thing they can ever accomplish- threats backed by all their friends and colleagues and siblings.

I find numbers hilarious, stupid and cowardly.

Like when my neighbours tried to "fight" me with numbers- this arrogant Edo girl who blocked their access to her borehole. 

And so the numbers gathered to frighten me. But they didn't understand then what they understand now about this-edo-girl-who-blocked-their-access-to-her-borehole.

You can't scare me with numbers. In fact I would think you even weaker when I see all your penises and breasts flying everywhere because of ONE person.  How powerless.

You don't need 100 people to fight one person. 

I don't know why we are like this, but anything that can be taken to court should be taken to court.

Exercise your legal powers, and if you don't, then, well, shut up.

Like that classic movie...

"If you wanna shoot, shoot. Don't talk."
