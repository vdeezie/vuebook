This is the life we live in Nigeria…

A premium brand like Chocolat Royale has been using expired products for their pastries and food. Ingredients expired since 2004!

Chocolat Royal is where you go to when you want some kind of luxury. It is not Iya Risikatu scrapping her last naira from her pocket to cook rice for her customers; washing beans at a river where labourers excrete. You do not ever have to hear the rumours that one woman at the buka washes her vagina in the pot of water for making amala to get more customers, or dissolves some kind of jazz in the beans.

No.

You go to Chocolat Royale because you want to escape that scene, assure yourself you are not- by yourself- feeding on rot; you believe you are safe from unhygienic concerns. You are in an environment where your money ensures you do not suffer food poisoning…or die!

These peeps run an establishment worth millions of dollars, situated in the aspirational part of town…yet have managed to show the kind of greed that can throw many in jail for a very long time if in a proper society.

Report says they were maggot bursts in some of the packs stored in the deep coolers at so-and-so’s house, owners of Chocolat Royale and the media empire under their trade.

How can we live like this?

Where is our outrage?

How can we ever be taken seriously if we let this become just-another-sad-news in the papers?

This is criminal and heartless! Children eat their ice-creams!

The Nigerian life is not better than the life of a dog in America! How can we even argue that at this point?

This is totally unrelated, but if all the e-APC and e-PDP pugilists can gather their passion in one bowl and focus on important issues like this… this much hate you exhibit for fellow Nigerians living averagely and suffering same issues as you, you can direct to some of these sects who have turned Nigeria to a dumping ground, running our lives like lab-rat.

First it starts from that terribly written report circulating everywhere. To read that would mean you’d be editing sentences in your head and be too distracted to remember this should come with outrage. How can we take people seriously when they write like chicken thinning out sand? This is a horror flick but you might want to laugh and shake your head because that report is just a tad bit retarded in its text.

It continues on twitter where people are already making cute jokes about it:

“Chocolat Royale is in the news? See why I like fried yam & puff-puff? Even if the ingredients are expired, that hot oil is a beesh...”

It’s not even funny. We are treated like subhumans by our kind and by foreigners, and we find jokes about it. 

I haven’t been to Chocolat Royale in a long time. But I know people who go there every other day.

Is this fair? The food is not N300 where you can shrug and say, “na me take my hand enter mama put buka”

How do you suffer this kind of news when you deliberately ensure this never happens to you and your loved ones?

I’m just tired.
