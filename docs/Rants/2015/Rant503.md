The woman with horrendous makeup is condemned with...

"Ah. Men have suffered."

But a man with a ridiculous mohawk isn't condemned by the lack of approval of the woman. 

"That's an ugly track on his head," we would say.

Makeup gone wrong is ugly.  Period.

Whatever has it got to do with the opposite sex?

She wears a revealing dress...

"Hmmmph! I pity the man who marries this one."

He sags his trousers like a criminal on deathrow...

"His boxers are dirty sef."

You see how we judge? The piece of accessory the woman becomes every time we open our mouths?

Everything a woman does... her whole life is measured according to the requirements of a man.

But a man is judged solely by his actions. Like a complete human being.

"Ah! Why does she have that kind of hairstyle on?"

That sentence is hanging on an electric pole. Soon it will be fried to death with the concluding part:

"Why does she have that kind of hairstyle..."

"WILL A MAN FIND IT ATTRACTIVE?"

See where the missing pieces of patriarchal idiocy are hiding?

Woman, your life as a piece of accessory is kept that way by your "fellow women".

#Unlearn or just shut up.

Ps: You'll be shocked how much of a maze this is for some. They will try to find the issue in this post and will not spot it. 

You are the midwife of patriarchy. I understand.
