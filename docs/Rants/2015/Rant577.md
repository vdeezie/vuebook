There’s something Pearl just shared with me that holds more truth than anything I have heard this year:

“Joy, isn’t it curious how whenever a woman is caught stealing, the first thing people think to do is strip her naked and start inserting things into her vagina. It’s never about punishment, It’s about shame. With women, it’s always about shame.”

THIS!

And that is why, as far as Feminism Vs. Patriarchy goes, TALK can never be cheap!

If you lack information in this time of our lives; if you lack common sense; if you cannot decipher the wiles of the society that patronizes you and shames you all at once… 

I am sorry for you. You lack the will to grab your own life in your hands.

When we tell you we are happy, you don’t understand what we have conquered.

Patriarchy has got nothing on me. Nothing. I have fought that battle. And I have won.

I agree totally with Pearl. When it comes to Women, it is always about shame.

Have you ever wondered how two adults- male and female- will go into a consensual relationship, then when it ends only the man will think it in his dumb skull to brag about the relationship? The sex?

Ever wondered how a man fucks around and still has the effrontery to talk low about any of the women he has been with anytime his shriveled cock wakes up to a bad morning?

Ever wondered why a man cheats on his wife, yet the wife leaves her cheating husband and focuses on the mistress?

Ever wondered how when a woman is raped people start to look into her sexual history to determine if she was Virgin Mary or Delilah?

Ever wondered why anti-feminists try to discredit Feminists based on their sexual experiences or marital status?

That is why, I say this all the fucking time...

I have no shame.

I am shameless in ways you cannot begin to comprehend.

I have rid myself of society’s shame…let me see what you want to hold on to.

I fear no one.

I do not allow Patriarchy get away with anything.

-Because it makes no sense to me that society expects a man to enjoy sex…but then shames a woman for enjoying it too.

The fact that we have Fuckboys who think that it is even possible to shame a grown woman for enjoying sex is one of the most ridiculous things I have had to confront…and that forever puts them in the class of rodents as far as I am concerned.

If you think like that, you are no better than a cockroach on a kitchen wall. You need to be smacked down!

The biggest issue with women is the lack of desire to be informed. 

One idiot said, “Go into the open market and preach ya Feminism.”

But I tell you, Women…you do not need to go into any field or market. Sit your butt down and READ.

Learn. Get knowledge. Then throw it all away and define this life by your own terms! 

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.

It is the same people that tell you to become evangelists for Feminism that will still tell you to mind your business and allow women stay in abusive relationship if they want to.

They might even suggest you are jealous of the (abusive) relationship.

I cannot put anything past Nigerian women.

Daft as hell. The dildos designed for Patriarchy’s pleasure.

See ehn, Patriarchy is a demon. 

It is the same Patriarchy that tells you… “leave her she’s a woman…she’s not strong enough…love her gently, slowly”

That same Patriarchy will demand that your lack of strength is reason enough to stay and find ways to live peacefully and subserviently with an abuser!

Patriarchy feeds you with one hand and inserts the fingers of the other hand inside your vagina.

You are being fed, yet you are being abused.

You are being sexed in the morning, yet your head is slammed repeatedly on the wall at night.

The shame of desiring sex. The shame of leaving a wrong marriage. The shame of your weight. The shame of not having a child when society expects you to have a child. The shame of growing old. The shame of your complexion. The shame of your own success- how it should never be equal to a man’s.

Shame. Shame. Shame.

Dear woman, society has covered you in shame.

What are you going to do about it? 

Run to a corner and cry?

Or grab yourself up and give it the middle finger?
