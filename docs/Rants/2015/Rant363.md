If there was no multiplicity of individual preferences and idiosyncrasies, and everyone was like me; these are 10 things that will NEVER sell, they’d have to close shop:

Coca-Cola (I don't think I have had more than 20 bottles all my life)

Nicki Minaj/Kim Kardashian/Amber Rose (no, Beyoncé, I will buy)

Twitter

Okada (haven't been on one in over 4 years. I'd rather not. Ever.)

Smart collection perfumes (reek of human sweat instead!)

Braids 

Bread 

Reality shows- Housewives of Atlanta, to Jersylicious and Chicagolicious, to Husbands of Hollywood, to Keeping up with Stupidities of every mediocre form

Meek Mill’s career

Disrespect.

Collect your change and let them fade out. As fast as possible.
