I daily question the need to hassle the price of certain goods/wares...

Like corn, batteries, sweets, ugu, a list of fruits and random stuff.

The profit on some of these goods are in the sad range of N10.

How do you hassle a woman who sits under the sun selling corn for N10...with all the energy and spittle in your mouth trying to win this 'war'?

Some of them have children in universities relying on akara sales to see them through school.

If any group of persons is deserving of a tip...

It would be these women and men hawking 'pure water', plantain chips and groundnut under the scorching sun.

The profit on a carton of their business, in its most optimistic day, is no better than N200.

They are making the best of life from impossible situations. 

Abeg, show some love to these ones.

It is all the tithe you may ever need to pay.
