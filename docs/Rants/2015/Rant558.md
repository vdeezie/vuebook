Most Nigerian-living is a predictable, annoying, disregarding, selfish, nose-poking community matter. 

Someone mounts a loudspeaker by 4am and starts to blast juju (or is it Fuji?) music in a residential estate, with people trying to sleep or read.

When he is done, religion will take over. Either through loud speakers of Islam or cracked amplifiers of Christianity.

You are at the bank minding your business, when a random someone pulls your weave affectionately from behind; you turn and she's wearing an annoying smile, "Abeg which hair be this? It's very fine. Where did you buy it?"

Neighbours will drag 8-month old babies to your door with an opening line, "booboo wants to greet you."
Booboo is barely one. She can barely speak. She belongs only in the arms of her mother. Go away.

People crawl into your inbox telling you who you should be, what you should be; opinions that add no value, pay no bill, work no magic.

My first meeting with anyone is usually shocking, sometimes outright discomfort. I do not look or sound like I have half the passion I possess. You'd almost be disappointed by this woman who looks like she is enjoying the benefits of patriarchy...well taken care of by a system that rewards only a few. When they learn you achieved it all by rebellion, they hold a certain grudge for daring to be different.

I am boring, mostly.  Because all I do is listen, observe, play with a serviette, wear a silly smile...and my only responses drift from, "wow" to "really" to "ahn ahn" and plain silence. 
I don't drink.  I don't smoke. I don't like to party. 
I think 15 hours of 24, I am a misanthrope. I don't like communal living. I hate noise. I don't like living or sharing my space with anyone.

Half way into any meet-up, you can see it in my eyes that I need to keep it moving. 
So... it gives people the idea that I am easily a push-over.
I have had one dinner with a group of women before- just one dinner, and for some reason afterwards, they believed they could mother me.
Older women with expectations.
One dinner later, I felt like their new acquired doll. 
They questioned my voice, questioned my choices, questioned the opinions I held, "counselled" me on who I should be or shouldn't. Told me a few things about certain women I should judge.

Or our very intrusive lifestyle that gives Uncles who destroyed your parents' marriage the temerity to send you bible scriptures everyday...old testament manipulations. Trying to play the age card; calling a hundred times an hour.

One call, I will not pick.

Bloody Nigerian entitlements.
