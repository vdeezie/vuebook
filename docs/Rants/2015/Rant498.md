That is how you will spend weeks monitoring your husband, checking his phone, calling his office, questioning his long hours at "work"...

That is how you will employ your younger brother to tail him... 

That is how gist will land on your lap that he is seeing one woman like that...

That is how you will come and be chasing your husband and his mistress on the highway one day...

Trying to flag him down; so he will see you and be repentant... *yimu*

That is how you will be blinded by rage- more by the mistress (for daring to have what it takes to prick *sic* his interest)...

That is how you will slam into a parked truck...

That is how you will die like a chicken.

When God will be asking you if your head is correct...

Your husband will switch to gear 4 with the sizzling relationship he is having with mistress- guilt free!

Guilt free sex... on top of ya bed!

No wifey to disturb bad bad things.

It will be the mistress' turn next...of course.

I jus' hope she will have the common sense to treat your hubby's fuck-up with the kind of disregard it deserves. 

Ps: Women go and look for work, ehn. Stop tying your happiness around a man's hip...around his motives and decisions.

You go jus' die for no'r'tin.
