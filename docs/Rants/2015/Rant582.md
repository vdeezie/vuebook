I am often wary of meeting boyfriends’ friends.

My only obligation, as a 30-something year old woman fully aware of her place of dignity in these matters, is to meet the best friend.

The best friend will get you. And in some situations (not in this present union), the best friend was a better human being than the boyfriend.

There’s every chance the best friend or most cherished friend would hold similar principles with your man. You will most likely get along with him. 

Anything else is like scaling a barbed fence wired with electricity.

The hardest task for me is trying to get along with a group of boys.(“Boys” is the general term for men hanging out, and doesn’t necessarily mean they are immature).

I withdraw from that camaraderie. Some boyfriends see that as a sign of a failed relationship; others understand that familiarity is one of the nastiest bugs that sucks the joy out of your relationship.

My people, whatever rocks your boat.

Boys talk about everything. Chauvinism usually takes a front seat, Sexism gets an extra beer, Misogyny is a harmless companion.

Unless you want to sit there like a mannequin…if you have strong views about these things, you will not last an hour in their midst. They will brand you “old” and “boring” and tell your man to go find a “cool chick”.

Me, I will not pretend to find those bants humorous or charming. I’ll rather sip on wet cement.

It’s the typical setting when masculinity meets with conversation and alcohol. You never know…you just never know where conversation will lead. So why plant yourself in that story?

Someone might even find a rape gist funny after glasses of liquor!

*cringes*

These situations can affect your relationship. I strongly believe so…

Because, if you are a zealous feminist like I am, you begin to wonder why your man keeps some rabid chauvinist as a friend. 

But in the world of men as I understand, there are many reasons people hangout over a few bottles of Vodka- for business talks, for career banter, for future projections; and even through plenty laughter they can hardly be called friends.

But for some women, if they haven’t yet met the entire crew of “boys”…they feel deprived of an essential part of his life.

I even hear some men use that as a sign to decide who a keeper is- you know, if you meet my friends and they like you, then this relationship will last.

Mehn! Keep that shit away from me. I am very certain I will not get along with 99% of the men that make up any boyfriend’s social chums.

I continue to expunge myself from those set-ups. Because that is what they are- a setup. 

Is she pretty? Homely? Dresses well? Does she speak our “language”? Is she cool with the boiz?

LOL! I’m too old for that kind of charade mehn; and I am counting zero fucks as far as this goes.

If you need external validation to know we are good people, then nigga can take a long walk through the Sahara. That decision to meet a bunch of boys remains solely mine. And I do believe a relationship should last longer than a few hairs on the chest before it is thrown wide open for review by people who clearly do not hold similar social values as you.

Thankfully there is no pressure at all from this end, so I am good.

Anyway, I remembered all of these because of an interesting story my boyfriend shared with me yesterday:

A friend of his met a girl at a fast food joint. He was in his car and she was coming out of the joint; he liked what he saw, and offered to drop her at the nearest wherever.

But in 30 minutes, they found themselves at a house… fucking.

After the action movie, they exchanged numbers and…of course, that was where it ended.

I don’t have issues with what adults get up to; but I had issues with the interpretation that friend gave the entire event:

Whilst narrating the story to my boyfriend, he concluded:

“This world don spoil sha! I just bang woman just like that. These girls are not properly trained these days oh. What a shame.”

This man failed to understand that the girl banged him too. This world is “spoilt” because two adults met, and within 30minutes they were fucking in a house that belonged to none of them…

How that situation brands the woman a whore and not the man, is what I have never understood and will never understand.

This moral pedestal men have for women that they (men) cannot live by is foolish. It is probably what I hate most about Patriarchy.  

If you cannot live by the standards you place, why do you think a woman should?

My man understands my position on these things long before we even started dating, and he shares same sentiments.

The first conversation we had many months back before we started dating that shot up his boyfriend material (heehee!) was on the same chauvinistic bants…

The boys were heading to a club. They saw two girls alighting from their car. Then one of his pals blurted…

“These girls are useless, what are they doing out here by 1am?”

“Dude, they are clubbing, just like you. Does that make us useless too?” my boyfriend responded. 

I don’t even know how we dated those types of men all these years- the blatant chauvinists, fucking sexist losers. 

I know it will seem like what is available for a feminist to date gets slimmer everyday.

But ladies, wouldn’t you rather be single than date a misogynist?
