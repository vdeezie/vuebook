I was privy to a friend’s conversation with his pregnant sister yesterday… 

She’s expecting her 5th child on a below-average income, with a below-average husband 

Her call was, of course, to announce the approaching celebration of another child to the family.

“Why are you still having kids?” he asked her

“It just happened. But we thank God.”

“What has God got to do with this? And what are you thanking Him for exactly?”

“Ah! Brother. You know man and woman thing…”

“No I don’t know man-and-woman thing. I don’t have a penis like your husband.”

“Ha! Brother, haba!”

“Can you not be responsible if he fails to be? Do you have money?”

“Money will come, at least we are not begging…”

“You believe you have to get to that level- be homeless and beg for food before your situation becomes desperate? Before you stop popping babies out of your ass like spring water? Woman, you beg me to take care of your family already. Between you and your husband, you owe me over N3million in the last 5 years since you have turned childbearing into a sport. That is begging; or you think it doesn't count because I am your brother? Do I owe you anything?”

“Ha! Brother why are you so mad? If you don’t want to help, we will manage.”

“Why didn’t you think of that before you collected N270k from me last month for feeding and fees, and N120k the other month for hospital bills and more feeding? Who do you run to when there’s no money? Your husband fucks you and I take care of your irresponsible decisions- both of you, like two reckless people.”

(A little sober) “He said he will pay you.”

“He has been saying that since the second child dropped. You people should have stopped at only one child- even that would have been a challenge.”

“It’s not like we will remain like this forever. This children will grow up and become something.”

“Yes, that is the prayer of every parent. But remember their first guidance and influence comes from their parents. What lessons are you teaching them when their father sits at home everyday waiting for Mike Adenuga to call him to come and run Glo. All the work I give him, he is too big for them, but he is at home- as jobless as a rat, fucking your brains out.”

“Brother please I don’t like that word…”

“Fuck? But that’s what you do. That’s all you do.”

LOL! Yes I know it’s hard to decide whether to laugh or cry. I laughed, but then I had to beg him to take a chill.

But we need conversations like this. We need to move as many people from stark poverty to the contours of lower middle-class.

One of my mother’s neighbours has 7 kids- all grown up, yet she can’t afford to buy drugs for diabetes. Her daughter followed her path quite easily; she blessed the family with her own 7 kids. Daughter has moved in with mother and aaaaaallll the kids into an apartment made dingy with too many people and no light. The bill they owe is so outrageous, at some point PHCN had to take the meter away (to stop them from plugging back to electricity)

When you have just One kid, you have a better chance of living a richer life- on your terms! The possibility of having a grand life at old age doesn’t necessarily come true because you blessed the world with 5 children.

That Arithmetic is inaccurate.
