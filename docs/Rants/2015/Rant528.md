A houseboy welcomed his fourth child from his third babymama whilst scrubbing the kitchen floor of his employer.

He (the employer) asked, "Why are you having so many kids from so many women?"

His response: "I want to retire someday. I cannot be houseboy forever. I want to born plenty children so they will take over this work and be bringing plenty money for me."

Employer looks at me as he hands me a glass of mango juice.

"My dear feminist, what say ye?"

I asked that my feet be massaged...

And I be left alone.

Ps: Mark Zuckerberg is expecting his first child with his wife after becoming a billionaire over-and-over.

We are all human beings, but some have the brain of a roach, others the wisdom of kings.

It will always be that way. 

So massage your feet and be grateful you can play chess.

Good evening.
