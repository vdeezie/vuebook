I know many of you don’t believe in God... it's alright.

But this is how He vindicates one.

This morning, this poster was a joke on twitter:

“He is not one of us oh. Don’t vote for him.”

A few hours later, it is now one of the best captions you can ever have in this coming gubernatorial election.

See, I don’t give a rat ass about Jimi Agbaje; just as much as I don’t care for that other one- Ambode.

But you will see how God will vindicate some people, starting with Jonathan.

Oh! But He has started already.

Not because GEJ was  a great leader. He was largely clueless as a president. Yes, he was. 

But there is evil in this world, and Jonathan is not one of them.

Jimi is not one of them. 

Yet, I don’t care. After all, that carcass- Bode George, is being paraded as his (Jimi's) backbone.

So I don’t care.  

I don't care for these people, just as much as they don't care if I have health insurance or good water to drink.

But what I care is having you think you can brainwash me with any partisan bullshit!

See how they walk on eggshells trying to address this shame of an Oba, asking for his apology…

Apology? Retarded much? Would that change how he truly feels? Would that change his true thoughts and intentions about Igbos? Or you just want to feel good about yourself and your allegiances?

So when the apology comes, what happens next? They  rush down to social media and start harassing everyone who wishes to stay on the matter a little longer…

“He has apologised nah! Let’s move on!”

Shouldn't you be talking about his arrest? Overlords, like a pack of ugly cows on twitter, caressing the matter like a limp dick! 

Your tongues all tied to the roof now?

Fuck his apology.
