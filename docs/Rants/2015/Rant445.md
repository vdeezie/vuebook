I met this wonderful lady on Tuesday, Gbemi.

Her property was used for my traditional wed- sorry- photo shoot.

She was full of smiles, kind, eager to assist without a shred of deceit.

Clearly very comfortable financially but still with a lot of untamed affection to share. I was taken. You don't see this type very often. 

So I engaged her in conversation and found out she makes bags and slippers.

I bought one of her handmade bags immediately. I plan to rock it this weekend.

If women support one another, it is one of the surest ways to empowerment.

And if the Woman is empowered then, may be, the conversation within her gender can shift from near-miserable pettiness to full-bodied discussion on wealth acquisition and economic authority.
