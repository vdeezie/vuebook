Life cycle means we all go through the same series…

We lose money in business or in some other career-related occasions

We deal with the loss of loved ones

We’ve been disappointed, even if it was in connection to something as trivial as the weather 

We have lost sleep over issues we couldn’t comprehend

We lose weight, add weight

Get upset, make up, betray trust

We build, we destroy, we share, we retain

We say stupid things, smart words; erect walls, construct bridges…

We’ve all experienced every single emotion possible- love, hate, apathy, anger…

We are all so similar…

How then are we so different and unbearable to the next person going through what we have gone through, or most likely to experience? What's the jeering about?

5 years ago I left a marriage and I wouldn’t even entertain a ‘family meeting’ even with desperate attempts made to get my attention. I left and I never looked back; never picked a call, never responded to a text message. I just left, like it never happened. And I have never asked for, thought of, imagined a different scenario with this individual EVER.

It was almost like it didn’t happen.

Three big wedding ceremonies (my white wedding was a fucking carnival) with people I could not recognise or had ever met. Let's not even talk about the Traditional union. Hian! (I swear, nobody can force me to do that kind of party again).

“Oh! It is me! I am your father’s uncle’s cousin’s last born…” Introductions as colourful as the confetti all over my hair.

It all came to naught. When you need to take a walk, you take that walk… and you don’t look back.

“Do you think of him? Ever?” my mother would ask.

“No. Never.” Not once did he even cross my mind. Like it never happened. 

And I’m not even mad, at all. I still believe it is the best decision I ever made.

So how is it that a friend would run into my arms, to be consoled during a bitter marital chaos, and I would be unable to empathise?

Agreed, mine could hardly be described as chaotic. There was not one exchange; I wouldn’t even allow for that opportunity. I was cold and unyielding. 

I might not truly understand how it feels like to want to end your life because of a spouse; but I understand pain (of bruised ego especially, not really reaching the heart)- like realising, “Really? Is this it?” And dousing your disappointment with a glass or Arbormist White *heehee*

Our lives are all entwined. We need to show some (more) love.

So this is for you- any of you. You are not alone...even though I do not connect to your kind of pain. I am still here.
