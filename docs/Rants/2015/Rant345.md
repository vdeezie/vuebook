5 things...

I really envy the peace Kenny Badmus must be enjoying right this minute. There’s nothing quite as liberating as taking all your clothes off- nakedness in all its glory and human flaws; there are no pockets or collars for hate to latch on to, they fall like a pack of cards to the floor. 

Every day I wake up with renewed aversion for the idea of Buhari as a president. Dude has not brought forward ONE strong point why he needs so desperately to be in that position- a position he had lost and with his loss, lives and families were destroyed in sensitive areas of the country. Now he is too grateful, too happy, this thing is really within his reach fa; too desperate…He’s going to first reward all those who believed in him and put down money for his campaign and then award their wives and in-laws with government contracts. That, he would need a full term to do; then hopefully at 77, he’ll start the campaign for another term so he can NOW take care of Nigerians with the usual chant of “QUALITATIVE food” and good roads. 

Angelina Jolie has accomplished everything possible for someone in her position to achieve, while Jennifer Aniston is still being asked about if ending her marriage with Brad Pitt hurts- over a decade later. Someone’s publicist needs to be sacked.

All these people losing friendships over GMB and GEJ are the saddest people in the world. These politicians have greed in common, we have need in common. We should stick together. They don’t know you, they don’t care about you. After February, you’ll have to come back and continue fighting for the same needs your grandmother fought for- good education, health, water, light, road. It’s a cycle sponsored by the devil.

My friend and thoroughly amazing dude, Kola Tubosun has been doing great things. It was he who, with a group of fellow enthusiasts, got twitter translated into his native language, Yoruba. While that is still on, he is tackling a new albeit related project- he wants to create an online dictionary for Yoruba names and needs close to $5,000 (I think). Your money or knowledge or moral support can go a long way. Kola, Eniafe will be very proud. We are proud of you. Baroka!
