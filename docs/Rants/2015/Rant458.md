Azolike Nonso Afamefuna poked me today.

If you don’t know him, then Mr. Biggs will never elicit the kind of laughter that can kill you.

30 minutes later, he sent a message:

“Hello, I was taunted by you…”

Poor thing. We are the least of his troubles. His interpretation of life is a more urgent issue.

And I know this young man does not stand alone. Do not be deceived by social media, many people- men and women- think like him.

Only difference is, they wouldn’t be so dumb as to share it with such passion and confidence with the rest of the world.

One meatpie weighs as heavy as smooching in the dark
One eggroll means your eggs must be fertilized.

That kind of thinking is hazardous.

More hazardous when it is said with faux dignity.

And that is what irks me the most- the unbelievable self-confidence about that post.

But there’s an alternate universe where men do things a little differently…

After #TheConversation, Bunmi and I took Temidayo to dinner.

Intercontinental hotel has an interesting buffet and we were going to eat and pop like balloons.

Someone said, “hello” as we went for appetizer. Hello never killed anyone, so it was acknowledged.

After an hour of good (and expensive) dining, a waiter walked to our table and announced that our bill had been taken care of.

Err… Intercontinental has the most expensive buffet, by the way.

So yes, we were pleasantly surprised.

“Who?” we asked. Who would want to carry that kind of bill for three women?

The waiter pointed towards the lobby. Dude was already heading towards the elevator.

“Wow. He just paid and…”
“He is gone?”

Our sentences overlapping one another.

30 minutes later, the waiter brings a phone number.

I know. I know. This is the bait, right?

Ayam not 13. We know these things.

BUT, the meal has been paid for, nobody is standing over my head breathing down my throat seeking attention or validation because he paid for our meals; we may never get to see him again. And apparently, he was fine with that.

He didn’t hang around so we could go and kiss his toes for such amazing gesture either.

He just walked away. Leaving us with a CHOICE…

To call or not to call.

It remains our decision. That is how to empower the next individual- male or female. That is how you show respect to the next human being- male or female.

That’s the alternate universe some people need to visit.

Frankly ehn, we all can do better with our choices, with our jobs, with our families, and with the friends we keep.

We can live better.

Why live in a world where people interpret Mr. Biggs as a means to an end, when you can have expensive dining and not even know the name of the person who picks your bill?

And please don’t be so foolish as to throw that number away. What?!

Call and have lunch the next day and talk about your different career pursuits. Invite your “Bunmi” along too *wink*

Be smart about everything.

Be smart about life.

And bind the curse of “Mr.Biggs” outta your life.

Forever.
