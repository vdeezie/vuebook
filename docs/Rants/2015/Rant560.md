Breast cancer awareness comes with some of the most irritating, dense and perverted campaigns.

From the “I am engaged”, to the “I think I am in love” promotion…All the way to the "No Bra Day"...

Society hammers on the objectification of breasts than the disease itself.

So a healthy girl takes off her bra…

In a t-shirt, her mammoth/ small/perky/flip-flop- in whatever form those pair of tits come in, she smacks the appetite of many who come with their own advice for the day:

“Put your bra back on, don’t you know you are the temple of jehova?”

“Abeg remove the t-shirt make we enjoy the No Bra Day well nah!”

“Yes, you are well endowed my sweetheart. Plix inbox ur number”

“I thot your breasts were fuller?”

“Nipples on fleek”

“How are you going to find husband like this when you share his property with every tom and dick on social media.”

How this No Bra Day improves the physical and emotional well being of breast cancer patients remains a mystery.

Sexualizing women, even with life-threatening illnesses, is really the height.

“Take off your bra” sounds like a track from Chris Brown.

So we take them off, then what?

Will it reduce the cases of breast cancer or even remotely draw awareness to the sickness?

When you think of a bra-less woman (imagine Kim Kardashian with no bra walking down the street), do you think of Breast Cancer? Does her braless breast make you want to google the illness and save someone?

Are we selling old bras to raise money to help 1 out of the 50 women who die of breast cancer daily?

Or is it just another exercise where men can gather at your feet and see if your pair can successful hold a pencil?

Or just the applause for managing to lift your breast close to your chin quick enough before taking that selfie.

Do we also get the same “treat” with prostate cancer?

Do men get a "No boxer day"? 

Jump-high-up-to-the-sky-and-let’s-watch-that-whip-slap-your-thigh kind of campaign.

Or something like that?
