A boss just asked, “What phone would you like?”

“A Samsung." 

The Samsung phone I saw a few days back caught my attention. It looked nice and was told worked effectively- big screen and masculine, but I can’t recall the name.

“You like Samsung?”

“Not really, but I saw one and I liked it.”

“We should get you an iPhone“

“No, no,” I said, “It’s too expensive, what if it gets lost?”

And he looked at me like I dropped from Mars. LOL!

That’s not me. That’s not even how I talk. 

What if it gets lost? Really, Joy!

That’s my mother’s voice in my head.

All of my 20s I fought to get that voice out of my head- this act of being the martyr of financial frugality.

The real Joy would say, “Yes, an iPhone, definitely. In pink, please.”

But I am not 20 anymore, and it is comforting to hear my mother’s voice when I sit across these expensive polished tables with people I never thought I could meet…people who shock me by saying, “I know you. You are one hell of a woman. Sit. Let’s talk.” 

A Samsung Galaxy5 it is then.
