What is wrong with this picture?

Absolutely nothing.

He is still her president, and courtesies should not fly out the door just because sheâ€™s vying for the same position in the coming elections.

So she bowed a little. Why should that be an issue?

The other day, a commissioner placed one knee on the floor to listen to Mama Peace.

Why did that too cause rancour online?

Are we not taught subservience the minute we pop out of our mothers' bellies?

Do women not bow to serve their husbands, employees stoop to hand papers to bosses, children licking the floor anytime a random adult nobody walks by?

I went to LASMOCK the other day, and students would run up to me and go down on their knees in a sandy sandy school!

What's that all about? Tradition!

They grow up and continue in the tradition that we proudly call "African"; so at what point are we expected to lose it? At what point in her life do we expect Prof Sonaiya to become nonchalant to the customs she (probably) grew up in?

Nigerians contribute immensely to the current tension in the country, trying hard as we can to ensure all involved remain sworn enemies.

Maybe she should have kept her right hand on her waist, then toss the book to him like a real G.

That is our expectation- a people with poor judgement.
