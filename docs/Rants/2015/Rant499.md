The easiest joke to tell is on a woman- her form, her ambitions, her wishes.

From Chris Rock to Basketmouth, the thigh-slapping jokes are yarns that denigrate women.

We unconsciously enjoy the beat-down of the woman. 

Half the memes on social media are jokes on women and what society thinks of her.

It’s so bad that people can’t find humour in a lot of things if it isn’t centred around women and sex.

Look at our comedy industry, how many political jokes do they tell?

Trevor Noah can go for hours without reference to a woman’s anatomy, her makeup, her weave, her man or lack of one, or her status.

Not Nigerians. And strangely, not many African American acts can.

We need to re-educate ourselves. 

Many people are too stereotyped they can’t even begin to think of a life out of the mental prison they subject themselves to.

I work with a group of young and passionate writers… but I realise they aren’t growing. They have become automatons who just dish out gossip and entertainment- copy and paste extraordinaire. Fastest-finger sport that eats away your hours, eats away your life.

So last week, I announced we shall have one hour every other day (three times in a week) to talk thoroughly on any trending issues. Three topics per session. Detailed discuss. Amanpour style.

I am tired of airheads. 

And it is an airheaded decision when you refuse to change a culture that continues to demean the woman.

Go to AY shows. Well, the last time I went was, say, four years ago; and I never paid for any comedy show since then.

AY will yab all the women in the world, then talk glowingly about his wife.

It is the stupidest thing people do.

The “king of comedy” in Nigeria, Ali baba, enjoys dishing out instructions to women. Instructions that place him above the woman, in control of her aspirations; that signifies he is of a better stock. I can never understand it.

But we are no different from them.

Now this post is running everywhere because there’s just so much we need to unlearn.

Some of those anti-female memes about worshiping at the feet of a cheating partner are actually deliberate attempts to provoke amusement and unhealthy- point blank idiotic- discussions.

It is done intentionally to get people talking- because the creators know topics like that are the best tonic and kickback for a sexist world.

I don’t engage in any kind of discussions around daft sexist memes.

I don’t engage in beating a woman down.

I beat fools down and they can come in any sex.

But I deliberately will always try to save a woman.

My attempts are deliberate.

Women have been mocked for centuries.

So I’m telling you- You either get another hobby or get out of “business”. Because things have to change.

My daughters will not inherit the world as it is, and its sexist glee. Things have to change.

People don’t even know when they are being sexist. 

If you take out their knack for kicking a woman, you’d realise they’d become empty shells. Their entire being is made of sexist fibre.

I don’t know. I don’t know.
