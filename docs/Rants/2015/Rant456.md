Mummy: Isi! I saw one of your friends from secondary school- Omeke

Me: Ah! Where?

Mummy: She walked by my shop and she recognised me still! She has good eyes oh.

Me: eeyah! Cool! She is a pharmacist now.

Mummy: Ok, but is she married?

Me: I don’t know. Didn’t you hear what I said?

Mummy: Wetin?

Me: I said she is a pharmacist.

Mummy: Pharmacist nor dey marry?

Me: That’s not the point. How do you jump from pharmacist to marriage in one second? Make we talk about pharmacy first nah. Let's exhaust that topic- are you not curious whether she plans to find the cure to cancer or ebola with a special drug and be crowned the first female or black person to conquer that feat?

Mummy: What are you talking about?

Me: Don’t worry. I don’t want to argue this morning.

Mummy: Who is arguing with you?! I forgot to ask her if she is married yet.

Me: Mummy, please don’t go around asking people if they are married yet.

Mummy: Why?

Me: Because there are other topics like: do you plan to build a pharmaceutical brand that can rival Pfizer or find a new drug for black women to naturally retouch their hair as it sprouts from scalp. You know, other interesting and far-reaching subjects to explore..

Mummy: Are you ok?

Me: Perfect, mum.

Mummy: Na wa oh. I worry about you. True!

Tell my mum you just built the tallest building in the world and would receive an award from EU; mum’s shoulders will rise like flour in an oven until you tell her that you are married with a handful of children, then they will drop in big happy relief.

But I love her :)
