I apologised to someone today.

Because I think it is arrogant to carry on cordially after a series of pointless disrespect and ill-treatment without addressing past issues.

I am not trying to dig for explanation. I am only apologising for my own part.

Her part would only matter if she feels the need to explain.

Which I hope she wouldn't.

We have carefully carried on anyways, like the past didn’t happen.

But that is deceitful.

And it leaves me with a lump of guilt every time we have to speak or laugh.

As if laughing over a pile of dirt that needs cleaning. 

I sent it in text form, let it be there for her to do as she wishes.

Calls are contrived. When it’s done, the words don’t remain. The wind takes it away. Interpretation becomes a bitch.

When you apologise for wrongdoing, you should leave the other person with some level of power. Text form gives that much power.

I don’t think I ever really would need her for anything.

But it is the right thing to do.

I was wrong. I admit.

And it feels good.

So there.
