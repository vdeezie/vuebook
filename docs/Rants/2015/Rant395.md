If you had Kim Kardashian’s body, there's every likelihood you may show off sufficient flesh and be tempted to record your sex activities; there won’t be a potbelly stopping you and the camera from being pals.

If you had Lindaikeji’s platform, you will scour for gist from dingy places like twitter and Instagram, like every other blogger. It is stupid and utterly idiotic for people to expect her to be “different” and “manufacture” her gist from Mars. It’s that range rover that continues to cloud your brain, making you biased and bitter. 

If you had access to the kind of money politicians and their wives have, you may go for liposuction…like Stella Obasanjo.

If you could write a book, you would.

If you could date Kanye West with all his stupidity, you would…and you’d trade your left eye in the bargain too. Toh!

If you can achieve anything apart from tweeting or bad-mouthing, you would.

But you can’t.

My point is: It takes grace and effort and a lot of “dying” to be different. We are exactly like the next person, and would most likely react the same way if we had the same things or find ourselves in the same situation. 

Your reaction to everything anyone does is expected of the kind of person that you are.

Average.

It is a comfortable place to be. Nobody is ever going to judge you, and you’d have a pack of average friends who will nod at every clever gasp you make.

You are not alone though. 90% of the world is just like you; take solace in that.

Let people achieve. Whatever they conceive it to be. Let them.

Sit there and watch. Be the spectator. 

Every gladiator round needs 'cheering' fans, no?

It’s bloody out here. Let those who want to fight, fight with sword and buckets of blood to get the kind of life they believe they deserve.

The rest of you, Shut Up!
