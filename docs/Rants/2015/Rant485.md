A few months back, I did a post on the A+ students in my alumni- Lagos State Model College, Kankon.

The best 12 in Nigeria are students of LASMOCK. Isn't that amazing?!

They were introduced to us, 1995 set, when we organised a fundraising event to rebuild the Library facility. 

I was inspired by the story shared by the principal... I got so excited that I pledged N10k for each student.

I shared the story here and, well, my amazing friends- as always, took on that responsibility.

Wale sent N40k almost immediately he read that post. 

Seun, my darling Seun who just gave birth, transfered N40k  before she rushed abroad to deliver.

Bunmi paid in N20k

And Princess paid in N10k

So, it seems I'm going to be paying just N10k after all.

I can't wait to present it to the kids!

I was going to send it through the principal, but I think I should go there and hand it to them myself. Use the opportunity to oganise a pep talk.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

In our small way, we are restoring a bit of Nigeria's dignity.
