I get quite a number of invites out of the country

But seeing that I love chasing my naira-and-kobo in Nigeria like a little witch...

I can’t leave all this work and be tanning my buttocks on an Island nah

Hian!

Yes, I suffer the Workaholic guilt.

But I just accepted one- a trip to Dubai

And I can invite four friends for the fun!

I have a full plate, yes- scripts I am yet to conclude, radio show about to kick off, a monthly glossy magazine in the works… a lifestyle site that needs me daily like a baby craves breast milk, another book...loads of events...another stage play...a breakfast show...

But whatdaheck! That’s just never going to change. I’m always going to be super busy.

So I am here to clear my conscience of any workaholic guilt.

I am going, biko!

I haff said yes. 

I cannot come and kill myself.

Four friends, check your inbox.

Let the planning begin.
