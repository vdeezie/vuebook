There's no fuel in your country.

No electricity.

The roads are empty. Everyone is running loose looking for a drop of fuel to quench their thirst.

"Lazarus, just a drop of water on my tongue please..."

This is our hell.

No-light-yet-no-fuel-to-power-generator depression killing Nigerians.

The average Nigerian lives until 45 and starts to deteriorate.

YET some of you think it makes sense to start a GEJ-on-marble campaign, and declare him the best president Nigeria ever had.

Oh wait, it is not his fault. Power has been an issue since Awolowo made his first fancy cap. 

It is the same mentality we take into relationships. 

He buys you one bra and he becomes the best thing that ever happened to you.

And when he leaves you...

It is not his fault. That woman was chasing him too much.

This our endorsement of mediocrity comes with a NAFDAC stamp.
