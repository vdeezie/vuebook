This is life.

You have the piercing voice, the beautiful face, the right and “acceptable” hue of black…

You have the body- the ass, the right boob size…

You work hard, you sing hits, you can dance too!

You are married to The Man- biggest deal in hip hop

As a couple, you are one of the richest alive.

You’ve got cult following, bees everywhere. The numbers are frightening… they sting, you die.

You are Beyonce.
***
YET, some Bajan girl with a croaky voice and a bad bad hip-hop relationship that never really goes away, with a million demons, as the world would like to believe...

Becomes the biggest success in music history.

With no unusual anatomy for the world to gloat over.

Life continues to teach us…

It is not about the number of people you have in your camp.

It has very little to do with the things we endorse.

Some of Rihanna’s best songs were made when she was an emotional wreck.

(Heck, Chris Brown’s best music moments were recorded when he was terribly disliked by the world).

Beyonce gets nothing but love. Love for being a ‘complete woman’- beauty, hubby, kid.

But who is King?

Rihanna is King!

Bow down!

There is something here. Find it. Live it.

And remember to tell your children: the next person’s insecurity  is not your problem; be genius. Be king.

In whatever situation- good or bad, be king.
