It is not the norm for poor kids from Makoko to become business moguls, leading thriving train of businesses.

It is not the norm.

When that happens, you’ll find it on the front page of a top business magazine, you’ll find it on blogs; it will become the inspirational excerpts from a life of possibilities.

BUT it is not the norm. 

99.9% of the time, if you have 8 children and you are broke and you cannot afford good education or proper moral training or motivation… 99.9% of the time, your kids will turn out just like you.

Broke. Desperate. Useless.

We take off from where our parents left, that is the norm.
 
If a boy with poor education and no sandals finally gets a scholarship to the UK, it is a big deal… because the eclipse of the sun would have to happen again for that ‘miracle’ to take place in that community- again.

No, he will not become the president. Fluke.

It is not every tout that will become a successful singer. For every Jay Z, there are one-million-and-one others who are still living on the streets. 

Life’s lucky fluke is what it is- a fluke. It is not the orthodox method of life. Life is a process of hard work, of determination, of education and enlightenment, and of more hard work...and ignoring half the noise that comes with trying and failing and trying again. Even the 1% need a lot of life's daily principles to sustain what they've got.

The pattern of life however is different: If you are stupid, you will make stupid decisions, you will live stupidly. And your kids will pick up from your stupidity. That's the cycle of life. It's a pattern.

That’s life.

And that is why I have a problem with preachers and speakers who use this 1% fluke as a yardstick for the other 99.9%.

It is flawed and fraudulent.

I went to a church once, their slogan was: “Bill Gates did not go to school…” You can tell the rest of the sermon from there.

Many of these guys dropped out and would brag about not going to “school”.

They are not yet Bill Gates. They will never be Bill Gates. And have thus lost the opportunity to pick on something that could empower them further because someone used an example that works only for a miniscule number to teach them about life. 

Life is not super story.

Hard work pays. It is never going out of fashion.

Don’t spend your whole time thinking of how someone met someone on a plane and got the card of someone who finally gets someone an oil bloc and now that someone would never have to sweat for work- ever.

Fluke.

You will not find that someone on a flight; but the thing is, you don’t have to.

Just keep at what you do. Life is no fluke, it happens to less than 1% of us.

The rest of us would just have to shape our lives in the way we would like to see it all by the decisions we make.

No fluke.
