I think Passion is a very beautiful thing; it’s what makes the world an active, dynamic space of great significances. Happiness doesn’t even come close to what passion can achieve.

Happiness is personal, selfish, meant for your pleasure, like wanking in the toilet or holding on to some really average moments recorded under sheets or on a desk or on a project.

But Passion lights up the world.

It is easily despised, criticised and misunderstood. But it is the only emotion that distinguishes you from a crowd of happy people- just happy for a loaf of bread or someone to go home to, things of such dull routine.

I know too many happy people. It makes me sick.

But when you come in contact with a passionate person, willing to die for what they believe, stand and be analysed, roasted under intense heat, you just come alive. It is priceless.

That encounter stays with you, heals you, builds you, perfects you. Even in your flaws, you are made perfect with Passion that is unwavering and undeterred. Your opinions, at every time you believe in something, is sold fervently.

You might not agree with all Passion has to offer; as a matter of fact, you’ll find Passion confrontational and downright threatening. It irritates the average person, crushes popular opinions, and embarrasses set rules. That is what makes it such an overpowering emotion that seeks a lot of things and nothing at the same time.

So where am I heading?

I watched Chude Jideonwo’s TedX Talk yesterday, and I realised how very frightened we are to accept that this man is almost a genius. You know? The passion at which Chude believes in what he believes is something you may never experience in another 100 years. We will never admit his genius; we are that kind of people that would just not accept certain things especially if it doesn’t go according to popular beliefs.

The reason you like Chimamanda is because The West has taught you to like her, how to treat her. If she was amongst us, holding brief on certain issues on platforms, like twitter, where you all gather to find some cool. She’d be ignored or at least we will pretend she ain’t all that. 

We need a set of (white) people to continuously pick the set of us that should be applauded.

I think Chude is one of the most brilliant individuals in the world. And it is almost a shame he is Nigerian. And this is my opinion, not his. If he was anywhere else, by God, he’d be everywhere. And then we’d have him give opinions that we would treasure because he’d be too far away from our grasp of mediocre and jealous judgments.

And as far as Passion goes, my friend, Funke Tega Phillips stuns me.
I may not agree with her partisan judgements but Funke is an exceptional believer; a passionate supporter of the beliefs she holds dear. 

She is out there- in a branded t-shirt, in a branded bus, dancing to the ‘change’ she wants, gunning down opposition, passing on fliers to neighbours and passers-by, distributing wrist bands; consistent with her message, and fearlessly rooting for what she believes is the answer to the next four years in Nigeria’s politics.

I might have a different view, but what does it matter? See how she sells her beliefs. Isn’t that just amazing? Beyond your gadgets and inconsistent political opinions, a mother of three (her young girl is only but a tiny lil pretty thing still wanting all of mummy’s attention) is out there campaigning for her change.

Passion will never be well-liked or fashionable, it will gather the dust of acrimony, but it is what has brought the world to this point- where a world even exists.
