I am sorry, I actually think it is stupid to define anyone on any basis based on the number of friends or length of friendship they are able to keep.

Many of you don’t get it, do you?

You are an adult. Life is not high school. Your list of friends can get you a drink on Saturday and cheap chatter…But when it comes to paying bills and taking care of life and responsibilities, you need to begin to get the entire business of life right.

It starts in your head. Think!

The benefits of these things you use to judge people, it’s too stupid to comprehend.

And that is why many people are poor.

You are investing in the wrong ‘business’.

I will advice you to give your life a little thought. The conversations around us are just sad.

What is this need to be liked? I can never understand.

How many friends does Oprah have?

I’m going too far sef – Jason Njoku of Iroko TV; how many hangouts do you see him in... chilling in a ‘bloodbath’ of I-Got-My-Peeps-Yo?

How many friends does Stephanie Linus have? She has the best Nollywood movie out in cinema. If you haven't watched 'Dry', go and watch it and marvel.

I am close to that woman. She has zero friends. 

Another woman: Omoni Oboli, working her ass out to get her next movie in the theatres. Building her directorial and production skills. She is winning. Zero friends. 

(Omoni's own is even worse; she won't let you into her space with all that fussy, frilly, glossy heck-of-a-camaraderie. No time)

My people, where are your adult priorities? This childishness is irksome!

I don’t want to see any childish thinker around me anymore.

I have pruned my life to the point where all I have around me is genuineness.

If I want to run an event for a 100 people, I know who to call on, and they will throw their MONEY, TIME, RESOURCES and ADVICE, even prayers into it.

I don’t call them ‘friends’ in the mundane sense of the word. We don’t go out to drink or hold parties and fart around social media trying to act like cool-and-the-gang.

But when I call them, I get results. Plain and simple.

There’s nothing quite as pathetic as when you…
1) Want to pay rent
2) Want to pay fees
3) Looking for a new job
4) Need some quick cash
5) Need some SENSIBLE advice
6) Need an investor for a new business
7) Need a sponsor to promote a project
8) Need support to keep your life afloat

...And you look around you, with all your cool friends, and no one can help you out, consistently.

No one can lift you up, give you solutions, help you make an extra naira…

But you rant endlessly about friendship.

Go and sit down, abeg.

When I planned to give money to graduating students at LASMOCK, I planned to give N120,000 of my personal fund.

I eventually gave out N250,000 because the original sum was given to me by people I know. I didn't ask. These are not 'friends'. So I decided to double the number of recipients at the event.

The project #50k4BIZ already has N200,000 in the bank. The project is under #TheConversation scheme to reward hardworking women who can get a little boost with N50k in their small businesses. 

I didn't pursue for funds. People responded without being branded 'friends'.

My people, life is not high school.

Stop being so simpleminded.

Sit down, evaluate the entirety of your existence and fix your thinking.

PS: I am not your friend.
