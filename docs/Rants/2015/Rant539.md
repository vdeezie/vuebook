That Economist wrote her little piece of article from the well of her Indian experience, I presume (unless I am wrong)

And I can see Nigerians are clapping. 

Oh finally! An article that gets it right. 

These are the ones who are afraid we are about to smash their balls on the wall housing their insecurities. 

Do not tell girls they are equal to boys. Why should boys be the standard?

It could be because patriarchal privileges are leaning in favour of the phallus.

Or it could be that Madam Economist needs a beer, truly.

Her mother told her when she was younger to choose a career flexible enough to allow her build her family.

What if a woman decides she isn't interested in having kids or marriage?

OR she actually wants a family and still wants a vibrant career. Should we be telling her to find flexible work conditions OR tell the husband to split hours for proper nurturing of the home and kids.

This woman is Indian. The society with some of the most blatant and disgraceful systems that daily ridicule and disregard the girl child...

Forced marriages, rape cases, poor education hanging on the necks of lawmakers...

India is hardly the model for any kind of opinion that tries to play cute and suave.

With the alarming numbers of poor Indians...you need to be full of indifference, like this woman, to question the idea of equality.

She has lived above the stereotype. She is educated, employed, has her own family... 

Now she wants to tell others how not to be like her. How to strive for less. How to be female with smaller ambitions...

All this she manages to share after fulfilling her own dreams, then- probably- realising she would rather sell akara and have a dozen kids...

And as a true selfish individual, she sells it as the truth to an audience who already thinks Feminism is just as bad as terrorism. 

Very convenient. 

Her message is vinegar to an already bad- tasting issue.

That article offends me in ways that will not even allow me attach the link here.
