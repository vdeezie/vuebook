At the writers' event in Unilag, I met a 300L English student who owns a catering business.

She cooks meals in bulk packages for other students on request- from her small space in the hostel.

She has a company name and business card. The prettiest card I've seen in a while.

After the event (we talked more about Feminism and the Business side of writing), she showed me a video slide of her culinary skills.

She has three orders to deliver around campus by tomorrow morning. 

Young. Entrepreneurial. Ambitious. Woman.

Unilag might have a reputation for sex and lucre; but at every turn I saw only young girls with a little spark in their eyes; believing.

Unilag is a mess, like all tertiary institutions in Nigeria. It is an embarrasing relic from the '80s.

Buildings as wide as a woman with broad hips. No working facilities. Nothing. 

I told her to make me a pot of soup and stew. She was ecstatic. So was I.

And I invited her 'specially for #TheConversation next week.

When you discover that prisons in developed countries are more equipped, with proper maintenance, than Universities in Nigeria...

You'll understand why everything and everyone with a little spark and enthusiasm... 

Is a miracle in this country.
