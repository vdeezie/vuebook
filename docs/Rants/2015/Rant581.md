Yesterday something special happened.

I had the most heartening conversation with a pepper seller.

I was complaining about something to myself, I think the cost of an item I was supposed to get at a store. She heard me grumbling, and she smiled:

“Madam, but you need to buy am?” she asked

“What?”

“De tin wey dey make you tight face so…you really need am?”

“Well not really, but I go like to get am.”

“I nor understand Nigerians sha. Light nor dey, but when NEPA bring bill, we go fear, we go pay for som’tin wey we nor get. Dollar don rise, people still dey bring goods enter countri. No fuel, still Nigerians go carry all their money enter bus dey go village to eat the same rice and chicken wey dem don eat all year!”

“My sistah, you are right,” I answered, smiling, happy. She only had a small rusted roof above her head, covering sun-kissed tomatoes, yet she spoke like she could be a guest at a TEDx gathering.

And it got better…

“Why we nor fit stand for wetin we believe sef?" she frowned, "Woman go tire to feed man wey dey beat am for inside marriage…she go tire to sleep with am…but she go siddon for inside like doll baby. Why? This kain PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE wey we dey suffer for dis country too much.”

You heard right. She called it by its name- Psychological Abuse.

And I wanted to go on my knees and cry…for the sheer joy of the moment.

I connected with her that instant.

“You are my sister.” It was a whisper but she heard me.  There were tears in my eyes. I wanted to hug her. Well, I didn’t but instinctively I wanted to.

It was awkward for her- my show of awe. She laughed uncomfortably when I wouldn’t stop staring. But I wasn’t really looking at her, I was looking into a future where women- educated or uneducated would understand that any society that instills insecurity and anxiety in them, encouraging dependence in patriarchy’s open arms, promoting unrealistic physical standards and feeding on desperate emotional needs… is not a society to endorse.

This woman is not a feminist, she probably never heard of the word. Yet she can tell the direction of the wind. She is discerning.  

As long as the gospel passes through walls into ghetto kiosks and luxury homes, from Makoko to Lekki, influencing as many as can fix a cup of tea and have conversations around changing the narrative…then it'll be enough.

For now.
