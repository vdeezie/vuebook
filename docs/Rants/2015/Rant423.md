This is Nigeria…

1) Someone will make rape jokes after collecting your N15,000 ticket fee and you, as a woman, will sit there like a monkey laughing. 
I will get back to this subject some other time. Uuugh!

2) An Oba will come out, threaten the Igbos, and APCites will still try to prove that it is coming from the opposition. How? Did they put words in the Oba’s mouth? Y’all better get ready for what is to come in the next 4 years. You think everyone is as gracious as Jonathan?

If this Oba’s words are being trafficked as smear campaign to make the APC look bad, why didn’t everyone think the same of that PDP envelope with plenty of dollars stashed in as a means to insult the PDP? After all, anyone can stamp any logo on any envelope. But here, we have quoted words from the lips of an Oba YET they are trying to analyse whether he said it or the words were planted in his mouth by a kangaroo. 

If FFK or Okupe said this, would you question the authenticity of its stupidity? Why then make excuses or try to "dig in further" like some forensic scientist to unravel the desperation of this Oba? 

Just accept it, things aren't exactly panning out the way you thought - first Jonathan wasn't supposed to give in so easily; he was supposed to call for blood so that we can keep this media space entertaining with swords and jabs and plenty grammar and analysis. 

3) A President in AFRICA (!!!!) accepts defeat, some of us find it exemplary; your candidate has won, yet you spend your time jumping from one platform to the other to dispute the fact that he shouldn’t be called a “hero”. You see how jobless you are? Will you not face ya work? Why should you continue to hound the calm river? There’s a raging sea coming our way, face ya front! 

4) “I am not a miracle worker. Do not expect miracles…” should not be one of the first few statements you make after winning an election. It doesn’t show empathy and obviously sounds very aloof and elitist- just like how we expect real African leaders to behave. Nigerians are desperate and hopeless; many of them have placed their beds by the feet of this man… is it the right time (or anytime at all) to respond with the “no miracle worker” rant? Why weren’t we warned of this important information during election? First off, do we even expect a miracle from this man? 

You see? At the end of the day Buhari is not a messiah, he is just another African president set to record his time in office, do his little bit, and move on. First you need to stop with the “Sai”, go and wash your face so you can see properly, and get ready to challenge this government as an OPPOSITION, not some drooling love-sick puppy who will accept any drivel from anyone because you are too ashamed to accept you were a tad too deluded and sycophantic about this man’s abilities. 

But it is "Easter Monday", let us reflect on our Lord's resurrection. Amin.
