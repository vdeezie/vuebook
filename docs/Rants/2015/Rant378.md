# Rant378

I am so sorry, guys...

But I have to move the date for the first edition of ‘Chronicles of the Nigerian’ stage play.

It was scheduled for this Sunday, but I have my head deep into scripting and publicity for an event- #GEJWinsIt to be held in Abuja.

Truth is, politics is all I think about lately, any writing assignment beyond certain issues only makes me miserable. And not just the talk or tweet of it, but a need to stand for something beyond opinions on twitter. I marry my appetite for politics with cultural issues that affect my gender, my rights and growth opportunities. 

My peace of mind, my psychological value, my income, opportunities available, growth possibilities, and personal goals are all tied to politics. 

How I can benefit from strategic life ambitions is in good proportion to the policies that influence society.

How do I explain to my kids, years from now, that I was busy writing on Khloe Kardashian’s liposuction when my country was falling apart with back and forth diatribes inspired by gluttony.

Like Brad Pitt in ‘Fury’, I am tired.

But I am sorry.

All 30 of you will still be the first to catch the play; and this time, I’ll be throwing in wine and dinner!

First, let’s see what life would be like after the 14th. I need to channel my talent to where it can make the most profound change.

New date for the Play will be communicated soon. Thanks y'all!
