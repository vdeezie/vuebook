# Rant347


January 10, 2015

The ability to laugh at ourselves is probably one of the best gifts of life. 

Because if we cannot laugh at the sheer stupidities and senselessness and selfishness that surround us, we will die sooner.

So laugh.

Like I laughed a few days ago after seeing all the pink highlights on a book that had to go back to Manuscript form. A book that was supposed to be under the care of a publishing unit, that had been tossed back and forth- from a Nigerian editor to some obscure New York editor and back to someone I had believed, based on his pedigree and friendship and publishing business projections, had my best interest at heart. And was supposed to be in charge of the entire project.

A project abandoned at my feet for the pursuit of sexual crusading abroad. Ehn?!

Penile activism is awesome by the way; but not when it interferes and disrupts someone else’s accomplishments.

This people didn’t do shit! I could have just self-published, you know? Sell all 1000 copies in two weeks, get Crowne Troupe to interpret it a million times on stage and get my usual author royalties from the project. At least that’s something I know I’m good at. Hian!

Every day I am reminded of a simple fact: if you are going to get anything done, do it yourself. Sit on it and let it burn your ass, that’s the only way you get things done around here. The scars on your butt will remind you of the misfortune of being Nigerian. You will pay but it will still be up to you to get it done, so what's the point?
 
See ehn, make enemies if you have to, but make sure nobody messes you up. That feeling of being messed up is heavier than even the act. 

So Charles and I will just have to keep laughing over the highlights on every. single. page. so I don't bury myself with the feeling of having being messed up.

It is remarkable the feedback I got from the first 70+ copies that went out. It shouldn’t have seen the light of day. 

You people are kind oh; I am flattered oh! But biko, burn those pages, ehn?

This is not a perfectionist rant. I am not a perfectionist. But just to reiterate, I will send you fresh copies this January.
