Warning: I am on a sexist roll *heehee*

There’s another twist to being sexist, and women play that role very well.

I’ll give you a hilarious instance that happened a week ago.

This pastor’s wife, who used to be wayward as fuck back then in high school (now a pastor’s wife and bestowed with psychic powers. Hallelujah!), called my man aside during an event we were all meant to do for a higher good to society oh, and then started to reprimand him:

“Why are you with Joy? This woman that feels she's all that! This woman that is always fighting set rules and guiding societal norms? This woman with strong-headed minority opinions? Are you dating already or are you just trying to date? Because I think you shouldn't oh! Because I think you deserve a humble woman. I have a friend for you…”

LMAO!

I swear to God, that was what dropped out of another woman’s mouth in 2015.

The best part of this idiocy is the text she sent later- a warm thankful text of what a wonderful person I am, how amazing I was as the MC of the event and my immeasurable wealth of knowledge in these things and financial support to the project…”We love you, Joy!” The message ended.

*sighs*

I am not in the mood for the obvious bellyaching theme here. Let us skip the woman-to-woman pretention and phenomenal hate that is in full display, and focus on something else we rarely pay attention to…

Women tend to believe Men need to be guided with their choices- like people mentally incapable and deficient in making smart choices.

That too is sexist.

We treat men like retards who need to be led by the arm to the woman of their dreams- with constant pressure, hating on the next woman and daily idiotic prayers that bothers on bullying.

We even borrow crowd of like-minds to sub endlessly on the next woman hoping the man in question will "change his ways" and pick their little humble friend/choice.

We don’t accord Men any kind of trust, faith or respect when it comes to choosing what they want. From mothers, to sisters…women are trying to “help” men choose their happiness.

And that is why we have special programmes in church strictly for the "Praying Woman". A gathering of women who pray for men- like they are some imbeciles in need of extra-terrestrial knowledge.
Ask those fervent prayer warriors what they are praying for:

a) That he gets a good job
b) That he dates a humble woman
c) That he is not put to shame
d) That he can rise and fall accordingly during sex etc

Random shit that anyone with a brain should be able to overcome; but we spend our time binding and cursing because deep down we think men are so stupid they need to be told what a “good” woman looks like.

Of course, it shows you don’t consider him adult enough to make smart choices; forcing your opinion down his throat is like forcing pap down a malnourished child.

Same principle of nutrition- one of the mind, the other of the body.

Both signifying outrageous disregard. 

PS: Biko, who prayed for Mark Zuckerberg? 

As if his success is not enough to kick average Nigerians to the curve, you'll still see comments like: "Your wife is not fine" on his page!!! 

We have left our borders and would like to "help" Zuckerberg with a "fine" wife.

LOL!

We know too much, yet we have very little.
