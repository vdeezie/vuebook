5 things you are gonna hate me for...

Do you still think it is appropriate to have Santa Claus sitting in a makeshift Christmas house with his plastic white ass-of-a-face and camphor as fallen snow, waiting to put your 4 year old child on his lap? 

With all the information you have received this year (on Child Molestation)...do you still want to sustain that old Christmas tradition?

I know you may be seated right there watching.

But are you really watching?

Majek Fashek performing is NOT closely related to Saartjie Baartman on display.

It is not. 

But it made me really sad to see all the pictures, and comments:

"God is good. Majek is back! Let's support him."

The only support you can give is let him rehabilitate fully. That man is sick. He needs introspection. 

Sick writers can write. Sick mathematicians can make brilliant contributions to algebraic geometry...

But a sick musician needs to stay away from all the noise and illusions of stardom.

He needs peace, probably a nice book, good food, kind people visiting everyday who truly care; he needs family, doctors, therapists and music. Loud music if he wishes...in the comfort of peace.

But let me ask for forgiveness in arrears on this one. I might be wrong. 

This is someone's legit hustle, I don't mean to knock it.

I am just a party pooper *covers face*

Nollywood I hope you find scripts that greatly empower women in 2016...like Mildred Okwo's 30 Days. 

The first time I ever saw, in a Nigerian movie, a man gracefully bow to the needs of the woman. 

He ate a vagina. In awe. In worship. In admiration.

*Ayam not saying you people should worship vagina... I am just saying.

I hated the entire time Toyin Aimakhu was mocking and subbing Funke Akindele based on her marriage or lack of one.

Now she is single.

Side by side Ms. Akindele, who is the real shiznit? 

Strip many women of their marriages and you have empty shells.

Toyin dissing Funke is like Karrueche telling Rihanna I have silky hair that grows from my scalp.

Nigerian parents, you will be chilling with your janded and yankee friends this season, abi?

Issokay.

Remember school fees comes right after you perform surgical operation on New Year's chicken.

School fees running to thousands and thousands and dizzying thousands of for-god-sake-why-so-expensive notes.

Your friends have free education for their kids abroad.

Schools that are way better than the ones you cough out a million or two for in Nigeria.

You live in two different realities oh.

Ehen.

Don't say I did not tell you.

From a party pooper with lots of love!

Have a jolly festive season!
