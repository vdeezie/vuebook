Before we get carried away, understand that there are poor people in every city of the world.

Racism is rife in developed countries. And as we know now, NYPD is just as fucked as Ojuelegba Police Department. 

Black people are holding the short end of the stick at every turning- from Los Angeles to Okokomaiko.

Because that's just how we are- Victims.

There is nothing wrong in being Nigerian... and for some odd reason, proud of it. 

I am Nigerian. I may not be a proud citizen, but I know that as far as my career goes, I have a good deal here in my country.

I have had offers, and the best deal I can get in South Africa or anywhere else people try to shove down my throat is nothing close to what I have here in this dark country.

The deal is not to stand up from your bed and head out to Antarctica.

Ask yourself, what opportunities does Antarctica have for you, for your career?

What is the competition like? Can they spot your head in a sea of a million heads?

Will a job in a foreign country afford you rent and a car,  and ensure you pay your bills as often as they come?

Will a job in Europe cover your needs? And will it keep you busy for the next decade, taking care of your wants, and enough left to have fancy dinners as you wish?

If that is the 'grand offer'... is that what you cannot get in your own country, amongst your own people?

What are the chances of breaking racial walls and becoming something of a phenomenon in, say, Spain?

Are you not going to be just another negro trying hard enough to please the world? 

I say before you get too excited with the idea of jumping on the next plane and waving your red/blue/purple/indigo passports at 'haters'...

You may want to review your motives.

You will most likely just end up as another immigrant able to buy bread for breakfast and bacon for dinner in another country.

That doesn't make you special. That makes you ordinary. 

An ordinary traveller. 

No better than the Nigerian banker who works and heads to dubai at the end of the year to cool his head off.

Remember Toolz came back to Nigeria to become what she has become- a first grade presenter- TV/online/radio, a brand ambassador of a few good products... even found love in the thick of this dark country.

What were the chances that she was ever going to get her own Ryan Seacrest success in America? 

I am very certain I will not get a deal as good as an editor and fledgling serial entrepreneur anywhere in the world...as I have in my country, Nigeria. 

America has nothing for me. It is just another country with a lot of shit and good PR.

And unfortunately, your dire pursuit to sell every other country as the country to be, will not turn your lizard to an alligator.

PS: And whilst we are busy bashing Nigerians who do not travel as often as a fly in heat, remember that the most ignorant people on the planet are Americans. 

Americans do not travel anywhere beyond the next grocery store; they think Africans live on trees, feed only on bananas, with a tail behind.

Yet you will not stop badgering Nigerians to pack their bags and leave their own country.

So we can finally be seen as the Incredible Achievers with a cape around our necks?

Please take a long drag on a cigarette and choke.
