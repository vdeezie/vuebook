I never forget kindness. I will forget a joke, I will forget a witty conversation; forget how smart you are…But I will never forget how kind you were when we met.

I remember a job I did in 2012 that literally made me drunk with excitement when I got paid. I sat down still high from the experience and the sum; and I trailed the events back to where it started because I wanted to reward someone.

I had an appointment at a company in one of those fancy malls in Lekki. When I got there, the doors were locked and there was nowhere to sit. I called the numbers but they were switched off. I wanted that meeting to happen desperately because of the distance and stress of getting to Lekki; I didn’t want an option of rescheduling (Island CEOs just like to reschedule meetings anyhow because they forget just how tiring it can be coming from the mainland sometimes; they believe everyone lives across the street LOL!).

So in high heels, I waited. My feet hurting, time was flying, but I waited and kept trying the numbers. No luck.

After an hour with my feet swollen, I decided it was time to grudgingly head back. That was when one of the receptionists from one of the other offices came out with a look of surprise
“Ah! Aunty you are still ‘ere? They are not back? It’s as if their Oga travelled oh! And the secretary went to buy something…because they are supposed to be ‘ere. Come and wait small, I am sure she will soon come. She can’t stay away more than one or two hours. Come and wait in my office.”

I asked if her boss wouldn’t mind and she waved her hand carelessly and said her madam will be away all day.

Walahi! That seat she offered me was as good as cold water in a desert. I sunk inside the couch and SLEPT- for another hour, and she didn’t disturb me. She just continued typing her work.

When she woke me up, she announced that she tried the secretary’s number and she said they all went to Abuja for a conference; they only just came out of a long meeting and could then switch on their phones.

I was so emotionally drained, I asked if I could take water from the dispenser and she rinsed a mug for me and got me water.

Small consistent kind gestures.

So there I was, still thinking of traffic and how wasted my day had been, when her boss walked in. We recognised each other immediately, hugged, talked at the same time trying to catch up on our careers.

Long story cut short, I got a new gig- she was working for a client who needed services I could render. She lit up when I told her I could deliver.

A month later, work done, money paid. I sat down, very grateful and traced it back to that receptionist.

If she hadn't offered me a seat, I wouldn’t have met her boss- a great acquaintance, and that gig, which happened to be the best gig of 2012, wouldn’t have happened.

So I went to the office to see her boss, but before I walked into her office, I passed the lovely receptionist a bulky envelope. 

“Haaaa! Aunty! This is too much. Thank you, ma!” she whispered excitedly.

Her happiness completed me.

Morale of the story: our wit is lame, be kind… damn it!
