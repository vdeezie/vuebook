An Ex just accused me of feeding him only bread and tea when we dated.

He was my first boyfriend in tertiary institution. 

We haven't seen or spoken to each other in over 15 years. 

Somehow he found me. And I am not pleased. So I pretend I don't know who he is...only for a few minutes, hoping it'll piss him off and I can block his number.

He remained un-pissed, so I soft pedalled.

"I fed you?" I asked. 

"Yes you did. Bread and tea, almost everyday. And when I complained, you screamed and warned me to fix my own shit if I wanted more."

"Ok. But...why was I feeding you? Did you give me money or something?"

"Yes, I did. Not alot but I did my best in the relationship."

"I doubt you gave me money. Were you not a broke student? Weren't we all?"

"You always insisted I dropped something for our sustenance."

The problem with that relationship, as I recall, was...

My next door neighbour.

Let's call her Timi.

Timi spoiled her boyfriend silly.

She cooked for him, washed his clothes, sexed him all day and every hour, ironed, cleaned, provided him money for liquor...

He ate and lived like a king on her account. She sacrificed everything for him. Everything.

So when you live close to a woman like that...

Your bread and tea is never going to be enough. 

Lol!

"When there's no water...you sent me on that errand. I tried," he said.

What he really wanted to say was: "You made me do it, even though Timi did it for her own boyfriend."

Na una sabi.

Biko, make una leave me oh. Me too, I tried.

That was the best I could be/give at 21.

And I really haven't changed much sef.
