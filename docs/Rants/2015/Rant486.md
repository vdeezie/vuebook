“Aunty Joy, I can’t write.”

How does a young woman who believes she can’t write host a grand and remarkable event like the New Media Conference?

I have long observed, and I have made my conclusions…

If I had any doubts, I have finally sealed my conviction today- Talent is just a speck in the field of opportunities.

There’s a lot more to success- Passion. Vision. Focus. Determination. Consistency. A healthy dose of unpretentiousness.

Let Talent rid itself of self-importance.

Social media overwhelms the average. We become voices with no direction, no goals, no advantage.

Olorisupergal is no average woman. Today, I know.

It is the same opportunities presented to all on social media that she has used to her profit, to her greatness.

This young woman just held the biggest media conference in Lagos.

She's still trending on twitter. 

I don't need any bogus statistics. I don't need convincing. I saw it with my own eyes. She moved a mountain.

Just one girl who thinks she can’t write, held Lagos captive for hours with the best-of-the-best in media exchange.

Let us remind ourselves of these things…

I have seen “talented” people chew the sleeves of their coats.

 Always clueless, always unsure, waiting for the sun to turn blue, the moon to crack like biscuit…waiting, hesitant- the kind of misgiving born of deep-seated pride that continues to whisper to their hearts…

“Don’t fool yourself. You step out now, someone will spot a flaw and mock you. Don’t make that move, what if they laugh? How will you recover from the shame- the shame of being ridiculed…of everyone finally realising you are not a genius. Protect your smarts; stay away from trying.”

There’s a lesson here.

Let life teach you.

I am truly inspired!

Cheers to greatness!

Cheers to Olorisupergal!
