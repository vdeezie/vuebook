It is almost impossible to expect the rustic idea of love- where people just gaze at each other and are gratified by the shape of their noses- to thrive in the 21st century.

It is unfair to demand that it thrives. The dynamics need to be altered for it to be pragmatic.

This is a fast world; crowded by many worthy pursuits all pulling for your attention. The idea of giving up an important meeting so you can go and cuddle in bed, for instance, is not cute anymore; we are going to wonder if you have any dreams, any sense at all.

Life is fast, ambitious; love is slow, needy, always judgmental... even when it is not saying anything, it is judging you with citations and extracts from Confucius. *phew!

Since we do not live by subsistent farming anymore, why do we still practice love like it was done in 1800?

I’m just saying.

Everything evolves, why has love not evolved? And why do we still make love decisions as if stuck in the time of Achilles?

If I ask my daughter, “why do you love him?”, and she answers, “he has a good spirit.”
I swear I’ll pour water on her head and instruct her to go and find a tangible reason oh.

And the answer, “the heart wants what it wants” doesn’t cut it either.

I am sorry, but we cannot live in a world where technology has advanced to the point where an automobile drives itself and a kitchen cooks its own meals, and we are still practicing love like they did when Juliet met Romeo.

“O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.”

Even poetry has advanced from this deprived state sef.

These and more we shall tackle tomorrow as we scrutinize issues from my book, What Pain May Bring. 

Come, let us reason together. Bring your wit and your strong points.

See ya!
