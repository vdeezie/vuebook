Errr...

Dear APCites,

Yes, Nigerians are going to poke at "change" and do a boogie around it until it turns to...

Eganch
Gecanh 
Angech 
Hangec 

The word will walk on its head, and will stand for nothing.

Get used to it.

If that's the only headache to victory, then it's a small fly at the buffet.

Eat and be filled!

How does Cinderella, trapped with a wicked stepmother for six years, complain about the colour of confetti showered on her after her rescue and arrival at Aso... sorry, Prince's palace?

Or the colour of the duvet on the prince's bed?

Biko, behave yaselves. Let ya heart stop beating fast when we mere mortals complain about the slow process to change one month...five months...one year after change was brandished like a triumphant penis all over our cities.

But it's 1am, let me go and sleep.
