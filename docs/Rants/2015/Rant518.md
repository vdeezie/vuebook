PS: This rant is all over the place.
***

There’s Hugh Hefner who runs Playboy Mansion and adult magazines…

-But is intrinsically a good man.

Then there’s Bill Cosby- the architype of black success and ambition; portraying healthy black values for black people to emulate, with a statue of his perfect self in Disneyland…

-Yet a serial rapist.

Everyday I understand that human judgments, like broken pipes, are useless, messy.

We are built by our own experiences and prejudices.

We judge based on our own very limited understanding, which makes all our judgments, at best, a stifling joke.

For instance, I have resolved to smiling and shaking my head when people talk negatively about Toke Makinwa’s kind of ambition.

She is narcissist. She seeks attention. Can’t she go home and grieve losing her husband?

You are there judging a woman living her life on her own terms…

When you drive through Lekki Toll gate, whose face do you see by the side of Shoprite with a smile so bright and pretty on a payporte billboard?

That’s Toke. 

Not your sister, not your best friend, not your favourite celebrity, not all the people you endorse. And definitely not YOU.

You run through a hundred ‘what ifs’ before you decide on an average chore or project…

Yet you think you are entitled to yarns on another’s method to success?

From your own failings, you judge the spontaneous person as egotistic.

A 15 year old girl killed herself recently because she couldn’t rise above being raped.

However, some women have built lasting institutions constructed around their own rape stories- help centres etc.

*sigh*

That 15 year old girl worried too much about what-people-would-say.

That is the problem.

People can only celebrate what they understand. You manage to buy a wrap of boli… your friends start to proclaim you are winning. 

My dear, you are not winning. It is just one fat boli. Eat it and move on.

It is what we choose to see in the next person from imagination diseased with cataract that we can either applaud or condemn.

People and their opinions don’t mean anything.

We need to teach our children that opinions are no better than wet fart with drops of poop.

I feel so sorry for anyone who allows a group of people determine who he/she is.

People living with their own fears and insecurities, their own failings, doubts and ill health; how impartial do you think they can ever be?

The minute you give them roasted corn, they praise you to high heavens.

The moment they can’t comprehend your next move, they spread a different view about you.

I hear that my rants are a way to shield me from all the unhappiness I suffer.

I heard.

From average people who have benefited from this unhappy woman at one time or the other.

But what do I do?

I publish a bloody book and call it RANTS.

I hear, again, feminism is what you cover yourself with when you are a miserably unhappy woman.

What do I do?

I release a blog and call it THE FEMINIST, and t-shirts to boot. 

These things people say...it's nothing. Throw a bone their way, or record one small success... and the story changes like sensational headlines on blogs. Its the way of humans. 

That is why I am of the opinion that it is not love that will make you succeed.

How many people will continue to show you "love" when they can't be part of your life anymore?

Hate is the fuel you need to Win.

We have to teach our children how to utilize hate. The world is full of it. Why not make it work to your benefit?

I feel so sorry for you who live with care; wary of every negative grunt.

You have mortgaged your freedom to those who can only make judgments based on experiences that stay on the tip of their noses. 

*I did warn you it was all over the place ;)
