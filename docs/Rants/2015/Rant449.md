A good friend of mine sponsors 11 poor children to school.

She has been doing that for years.

Today she was complaining about one of them- the fact that his mother won’t allow him to be great.

“He really wants to go to school, but his mother keeps sending him to the market to hawk on school days, saying he is wasting his time learning…”

The mother claims she is “old” and wants to eat, who will feed her if her son goes to school?

So my friend asked her: “How much does he make hawking every month?”

“Eight thousand,” she responded.

My friend said she’d make the money available to her every month- N8,000; but she should let her son go to school every day.

Understand this: My friend is PLEADING with this woman to allow her OWN son get an education.

An all-expense paid schooling till the last exam papers will be submitted in SS3. And knowing my friend, she would willingly see him through tertiary institution. Yet all the mother wants is a hawker for a son with the prospect of N8,000 every month. 

This illuminates the fact that poverty has nothing to do with money, it’s a mind-set.

Even though my friend was willing to pay this woman what her son would normally bring in hawking at the end of the month, she still wouldn’t allow the boy go to school regularly and would find some stupid errands to engage the poor child.

It’s a cocktail of ignorance, penury and pride.

Yes, a lot of pride. Poor people have obese egos that are balanced on superstition.

There's no excuse for a parent to be this irresponsible.
