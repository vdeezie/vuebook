The jolt of Feminism is partly about what we will do with ourselves.

Women.

This is not just the cliché of hating one another.

It is a fact that Feminism, unlike Racism and Blacks, is not and will never be widely accepted by all females.

Why?

Because patriarchy is comfortable for many women.

Believing that someone else, of the opposite gender, is responsible for your happiness or pain; failure or success is a very easy place to be.

Responsibility is a tough job not many women want to claim; even though they already live in the realities of being breadwinners; it is still not good for their ego to accept that they are already “men”. 

That is usually where pretence takes over- slipping money under tables for the man to pay for dinner, lying point blank that a man bought those Valentine gifts you bought for yourself; believing he loves you more than the other woman because at one time he had your picture in his wallet.

You know, outrageous thoughts and actions that show how much you wish to be beaten and trampled upon by patriarchy.

So when we come along and tell you…

If he hits you once, leave!
You can pay for your own dinner… and his!
You don’t need a man, really. Not in the context of needing-a-man that we have come to understand passed on through generations.
You can focus solely on a career and be happy and content.
You can pick up your own bills without waiting for someone to come into your life and save you from womanhood as if it is some kind of disease.

But women don’t want to hear that. They don’t want to be reminded that they are adults and should fix their own lives.

They need to hold on to patriarchy to inject the daily shot of pseudo-emancipation that helps them blame everything else for their poor choices.

I stopped watching Steve Harvey show after one very base episode…

The guest was a woman who had been well taken care of by a rich older married man for many years…

She was brought on the show to cry, and share her story of how this man “used” her.

Now check this… she was nothing without this man. Some lowlife scum impregnated her in her 20s and she was left with nothing. She was waitressing and getting her ass pinched by the lowest-of-the-lows when she met this wealthy older man on her way home one day, still dressed in her sexy attire.

She was aware he was married. But she went with the flow. He got her an apartment, put her son in a good school, got her a nice job. Gave her pocket money too- weekly! 

He wasn't violent. Wasn't nasty. 

He saved her from a life that would have been coloured with bruises as a pimp material picked up and dumped at will in poor American neighbourhoods.

10 years later, with everything plus regular sex… this woman comes on TV to act like a victim. And patriarchy, in the form of Oga Harvey, was consoling her and drumming it into her heart that she was used.

How?

That’s the kind of shit I can’t stand.

That’s the situation with patriarchy. Women like it because it keeps us as helpless victims.

When you live all your life’s worth and follow a man to god-knows-where to start all over again, then faced with the disappointment of finally realising he is a bloody human being with insurmountable flaws; you come back after 5 years of waste to cry victim and gather sympathy.

Women like that.

Our choices are disgraceful and irresponsible because we believe we can hide under patriarchy to continue to act like "dumb blondes" and be consoled by the other hand of patriarchy that is patronizing.

That’s why we would have to fight ourselves first before we even get close to men.

-Because Feminism is not going to leave room for women to continue to feel sorry for themselves or blame anyone else for the choices they make.

Women fighting over men; side-chick brouhaha; multiple baby mamas… are all preambles and entertainment for Patriarchy.

But women like it. 

And Feminism is putting san’ san’ inside their garri.

So, before we get to the men; we will first tear ourselves apart. 

I hope you are ready? Cos I am!

This second-class living that you have embraced above common reasoning cannot continue to be the norm.
