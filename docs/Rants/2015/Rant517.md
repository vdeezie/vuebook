The issue is not that Serena is black and curvy- bulky, if you like

The painful reality for the world is that she would dare to succeed in a “white game”, respected and loved by mainly white people who created this genre of activity for their pleasure.

If she was a video vixen, shaking to the beat of Drake or Chris Brown’s jingle, it wouldn’t be such a headache. She would fit in and be accepted easily. Loved even.

All that ass and boobs and weave will be put to good use.

After all she is black. Female. With an ass. She belongs bewteen cracks of misogyny and hip-hop.

Not within the privileges of respectable sports.

It is that audacity that people hate. It is hard for the world to swallow. Especially when she is so unapologetic about winning.

We know this feeling…

When a woman refuses to follow the popular script of marriage, for instance (since it remains Africa’s biggest pride to marry all its women as a sign of success), and dares to think of other accomplishments above the need to have children…

Society cannot handle that kind of thinking. It is an insult to egos. An offence to ‘culture’.

When I said during #TheConversation in Lagos:

“it is one thing to be a woman, another thing entirely to be a black woman. A curse”

Some retarded scoundrel went on a penis-slinging sport on a participant’s wall.

In his attempt to ensure black women do not take one rebellious step out of line, he went straight into attack mode…

His reaction was, to me, a desperate need to conceal iniquity. 

Like someone who would beat up his wife…but would quickly run out to remind the world that black women should be patient, longsuffering, godly, quiet and obedient.

You know? That kind of manipulative shit. 

“Can’t you see what this woman, Joy, is saying is wrong? How can you allow her say these things about black women? I have a mother and sisters and I am proud of what they are. The African woman is a cultured woman, every race wishes to be like her. She is a multi-tasking queen….yada yada”.

I don’t know what the fool was on about. I am a woman, and I am not a "multi-tasking queen". And it is a lie to say every race wishes to be like black women.

They tell black women too many lies to keep her from dreaming.

Woman, you are not born to be good at multi-tasking, you are not made to be a good cook; any culture that suggests you are incomplete without marriage or kids is evil; you do not have to be patient or quiet; you do not have to be prayerful if you do not wish to be. You do not have to be anything except who you are,

They tell you: "A true African woman is prayerful, she knows how to hold her family down. She wakes up before everyone to keep the home from being devoured by lions".

All these patronizing lies because we need to keep encouraging women to be domestic slaves, to make up for failing to raise competent men.

Anybody can learn how to multi-task or cook or pray or tear a lion’s mouth. 

It is not a job reserved solely for an African woman.

Let her be whatever she wants to be.

If, like Serena, she wants to walk right into “white territories” and be a smashing success...

That is what she should be… without labels, without culture, without limits.

Body-shaming and 'African culture', societal expectations and religious jargon et al should not stop you on your tracks.
