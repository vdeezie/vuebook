Area boys kill everything in Lagos. 

They have turned a city, once bubbly with energy and drive, to a stark empty hole with fear as a close daily companion . 

What is this?

People are harassed everyday in traffic. 

Bring your phones, bring your money, bring your purse.

While others stand by and watch.

Fellow road users stop breathing, hoping this act will make them disappear like the ostrich with it's head in the sand.

I heard the story of a woman robbed at a bus stop, and when someone else questioned the tout, he turned and slapped her. And walked away.

Everyone stood by and watched. 

In broad daylight, we cannot defend our city. The home of our livelihood.

A girl was robbed last week by two area boys disguised as street traders. Her car window was down and they demanded everything she had.

The sun was still up. Barely 5pm. People stood by and watched; turned and walked away.

What is this lethargic reaction to crime?

Imagine if, one day, we all alight from our cars and buses and okadas and confront one of these touts stealing leisurely at bus stops and in traffic...

Imagine what we will start.

They are only a few. We are many. 

Who is god in Lagos? We are gods in Lagos.

Not them. Our numbers- those seeking honest income- should count for something. 

Life is a cycle. What you will not confront will continue to torment you.

These area boys have become our pain.

It will cost less for government to intervene but they have refused to. 

The price we have paid as a people, the losses we have suffered. This negligence is cancer. 

We have to take care of us.

It's insane for robberies to take place in broad daylight with spectators helpless and unwilling.

We have to stamp this out. 

When my tyre burst in the middle of Apogbon road,  touts harassed my driver for 30 minutes. It was the longest 30 minutes ever.

I locked myself in the car. I chose to suffocate to death than have any of them touch me.

They started from N50k. They hit my window, pointed fingers at me, threatened and cursed. I held on to my pocket knife.

The knife will kill one, at least.

One less infidel in the world.

We managed to escape their claws with N3k.

A tough bargain that took ten years off my driver. He aged at once. 

And it was just 6.30pm, with the sun still flaunting its glory fa.

We need to change Lagos. 

We need to rid ourselves of these touts.

One confrontation at a time.
