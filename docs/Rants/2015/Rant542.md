"The beauty of a woman is..."

Whatever the hell she wants it to be.

If she wants it to be her ass, then it is her ass...not in the way she "prays and intercedes for love to win".

If she wants her beauty to be judged by the hours she puts in her job, then that is exactly what it is... do not tell her it is supposed to be in the way she "loves from within her spirit".

Let her beauty be in the way she argues and farts and sings Rock songs with a croaky voice... not in the way she "sings praises to god"

Point is...you all need to drop the shackles and let the woman live her life on her own terms. 

It is patronising and condescending when you keep telling a woman what she should be.

Whatever she is, is good enough. In line with her temperament and pursuit, help her to get better.

Save your "warm at heart" sermons for a lamb... 

A tough woman should not be badgered into submission or quiet. 

She likes the noise. She loves the chaos.

That is beautiful.

And if she doesn't...that too is beautiful.

All these instructions for women, we have to get rid of them before our children sign up for Facebook. 

I don't want my daughters thinking they are not good enough because some confused people are on social media speaking from both sides of their mouths.
