I got a call from the principal of LASMOCK yesterday.

He called to invite me as a special guest speaker for the Valedictory service of the SS3 students.

I get very rewarding speaking engagements…but this is truly special 

As an alumnae of LASMOCK, it’s a huge privilege.

I can't wait to receive the invite; even if it is made of cardboard by the students. It will be cherished.

See ehn… I don’t believe we can save our generation. 

Our pottery has been caked by the sun.

Most of what we yap about is just pretense. We are still going to go to our little private corners and 'suck dick'.

The perfection of a sham.

I am not pursuing equality because I think some 30+ year old woman is going to repent of her patriarchal ways. 

Carry a big box on your head, back a baby, hold a luggage and give your hand to your man to hold, whilst he takes a leisure walk by your side...

Be a slave. Be a door mat. Be a cook. Be a sleeping pill. Be a dog at night and a fowl in the morning.

That, woman, is your bloody business.

You are as hopeless as patriarchy itself.

I need to kick you out of the way. Drive a nail into your skull until you fall sick- literally…

All I care about is the young adult. The teenagers and pre-teens.

We need to preach a different gospel.

I don’t get the opportunity to talk to these ones often.

So when I am called to speak to the entire Class of 2015…there’s just so much going through my mind.

The teenage girls…oh dear! Who will protect them from the bile of patriarchy?

The boys…who will alter their perception of leadership and submission?

These are the ones we need to care about. These are the ones we need to save.

After secondary school, what next?

Dream, baby. Dream. 

And don't fall for a routine.

You can be so much more than just a part of patriarchal statistics.
