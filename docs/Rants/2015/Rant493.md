I just realised there are some cool experiences my children would have missed out on if they didn't have a grandmother...

"Go and buy akara and ogi across the street..."

"Go and grind pepper at that shop..."

"Go and buy bread...then branch and buy me one medicine- sxeptomicolonocim. Remember the name oh! Oya repeat it..."

I mean, where in the world would they have those kind of experiences if not with a grandma?

When they stay over at mine, we go to the supermarket, buy everything and stay in with television.

So last week, they had a story to share...

"Mummy... that was how we went to 'grind pepper' at one shop around the corner... and it started to rain!!! So we squeezed ourselves inside the woman's small shop...roof like broom sticks...rain dropping on our heads... then we saw grandma coming towards us with two umbrellas. She was laughing at us and so we laughed at ourselves. That is why our hair is smelling...because of rain."

And that was how I started crying oh...like a pregnant woman.

Hian!

I think it was the way they narrated the event. It was so beautifully said. And my mum, bless that woman. 

I held them and I cried and kissed their smelly hair.

The younger one crushed her head under my breast and the older one rolled her eyes. Lol!

I am blessed. 

That much I know.
