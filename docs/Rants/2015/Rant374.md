I am used to being financially responsible for my outings. I would reach out for my purse in my bag to pay for my meals, and sometimes for the next person’s.

It’s instinct. Even on romantic dates.

But in the last few weeks I have been warned to “keep your purse in your bag, Joy.”

LOL!

I am not fiercely independent. But I am independent.

And it’s just such a weak place to be when you aren’t allowed to spend your money.

Weak, but a very pleasurable and enjoyable place indeed!

I am not complaining- at all.
