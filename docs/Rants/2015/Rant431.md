At first consideration, bullying Linda Ikeji for “stealing” your material doesn’t appear to be a bad thing…

That was in the beginning of puberty- when it was ok to watch Elnathan tweet a series of gut-wrenching reasons Linda should burn in hell for lifting pictures from his page without even a salute for his effort.

Then a series of numbers to harass her to a pulp would follow.

Now, it’s a tad bit exasperating.

I don’t like the idea of subbing people. It’s not like you can kill me if I share my opinion. So when people find themselves in my article and make reference to it on how so so lonely they think I am with desperation for attention, I want to ask you the same thing- when you write for your platform- twitter or Facebook or website- are you not seeking attention? 

I would think every writer would be exposed to some kind of “loneliness and attention” because the trade demands it.

I have a website to run, books to sell, tickets for my shows… if there’s a store where I can buy an extra carton of attention and some oh-so enthralling companionship to cure my loneliness, kindly direct me to it… lest I die of its lack; since you know me so well (what then is the colour of my butt?)

But let me allow this nipple become full breast…

Yesterday another mob justice was given in full measure to Linda Ikeji, again. This time by Olisa.tv 

I was an editor at Olisa.tv for 4 months; let’s just say I didn’t leave with a bouquet of flowers.

(I was so so lonely and seeking attention and bitter and manipulative and difficult and evil and in need of a hug…madly. See? I just saved you gossip time. Be grateful).

So when I saw a trailer load of insults slapped on Linda Ikeji on my timeline, I knew it was about that Chimamanda’s latest piece on Oba Akiolu.

I run happenings.com.ng and one of my writers had drafted that story to be published; the minute I saw it I deleted it and warned him to stay off any Chimamanda’s rant. 

Why? Because I have worked at Olisa.tv and I know the boss (a good man, by the way. Great guy!) running things behind the scene is Chimamanda’s manager; so almost every article from Chimamanda will come in as an exclusive. No sweat there.

But nobody else would know this.

The first place I read that article was here on Facebook- someone copied the whole piece as a post with no credits and gathered 120 likes and 53 comments in less than 4 hours.

But with background knowledge, I knew it was lifted from Olisa.tv

On my timeline, I saw Ynaija had used the article, and so many other sites- too many to count; and like a viral article it might be hard to trace back to its original owner.

Linda might fall in here. Picking up the piece from the streets, and believing it has no father.

It doesn’t make it right, but throwing tyres and petrol and chanting war songs, ready to burn her and her Range Rover is Mob Justice; and it should be unacceptable.

If you see your television in the possession of someone, take them to the police station. We can’t condemn mob killing in real time and have it done on Twitter.

Even Linda must be exhausted by now, and when you get to that point you are just waiting for someone to send you a court order. Someone to do the right thing and let the courts decide what makes a cyber-thief. Once and for all.

Let our private parts grow some pubic hair. This numbers…my God! Enough of the twitter shaming, abeg. The numbers are crushing! The cries and invectives and introductions and chants…no, please!

I don’t think anybody has suffered theft like sabinews. Before my article drops every week- in just 15 minutes, that one called Ladun would pick it up. Very unsophisticated approach! 

My first 21 articles was stolen unabashedly for weeks (until TK slammed that clause under every article after Pearl's was "stolen" by, yes, Linda)! So naïve and unapologetic were some of these bloggers (not Linda), they even send me the links to their sites and tell me, “I cannot wait to read the next one! Yay!”

It’s not so much theft but our Nigerian familiarity.

And if you don’t agree then do what you must. Linda is just one person with a lot of money.

I have never met her. All the PR transaction I have done on her platform (the last one was in 2013- way back), I paid premium price. There are no ties here. So this is not a post to defend a friend; and I am not picking on olisa.tv (because I am so so lonely and in need of attention)…

What am I saying? As serious online magazines, we need to do it a little differently from the people we believe are pedestrian.

It was fun then; but it's just as bad as the act of theft now.

But what do I know. I need to stop being so damn lonely and in need of attention.
