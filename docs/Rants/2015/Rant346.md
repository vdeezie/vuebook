Ladies, if you are like me then this is the kind of money you could save in a year.

Just for fun; let’s go (heehee):

If you don’t wear weaves, you save close to N10,000 every month (and that’s for synthetic hair. For human hair, you probably have 3 different bundles worth approx. N200,000 each. However, it’ll last all year, but maintenance and fixing will still gulp all of N5,000 every other month or more!). 
I spend N1k every month to curl my hair. Simples :D

If you don’t drink, you save up to N15,000 a month (again, for social drinkers who drink cheap liquor. In other luxury instances, you’ll be saving close to N50,000 a month or more!)

If you don’t smoke, you save probably N3,000 a month (I don’t know how much cigarettes go for)

If you don’t go out; Ah! You’ll be saving the kind of sum that can get you an education (sometimes close to N40,000 a month, and that’s for average spenders)

If you don’t care for trends, you wouldn’t have a Louboutin (those heels go for as low as N100k!)

You wouldn’t care for a diamond plated iphone 6 that goes for over N100k!

You wouldn’t have a wardrobe full of expensive designer wears with the cheapest tag for $1,500!

Not keeping up with the Joneses can save you up to N50,000 a month...or more!

So, if you are like me and you are just a plain Jane, you’ll be saving approximately N950,000 per annum for things you can live without.

Hehehehehe! You are welcome.
