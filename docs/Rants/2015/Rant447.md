One of the most tragic discoveries you’ll make as an adult is confronting the fact that people do not change after a certain time have elapsed; and in many cases, that would mean from secondary school until they die.

So if you are trying to link up with anyone from high school, you better perfect your moonwalk skills.

A few years back, I was in charge of the Lagos premiere of the movie, “Conan- The Barbarian” at Genesis Deluxe, Lekki. 

It was my big night.

I had invited a dear friend from high school whom I reconnected with via social media. Thankfully, she is one of the few people years had improved. She was nicer than I could recall.

But she was still friends with one of the most obnoxious high school clique-thirsty chick I ever knew.

And she was going to surprise me on the day of my premiere, with over a hundred guests, with this insufferable character.

I didn’t know what her “surprise” was, until they arrived. 

She meant well, this friend, but it was far from a pleasant surprise.

I had no prejudices at first until I carried my big smile and wide arms towards this character and…

Oh my!

The cold shoulder I got ehn... with a greasy sneer right in my face…

And there, I was reminded of how much of a despicable insect she used to be in high school.

Nothing had changed.

So why the hell did she come for my premiere?

She is still living in the delusions of a past where she was largely insecure about her height, her looks, her ass and her general cool- of which she was never cool enough, if truth be told.

On my big day, it was like handing me a flower plagued by insects.

I despised her. 

And I really hope I never get to see her again.

Why did I remember this? 

Well, today went so well. Someone (from high school!!! haha!) sent money that would cover me and Temidayo’s hotel bills from Saturday through to Monday as we prepare for #TheConversation…

It was a perfect day; I just thought to depress myself a little.
