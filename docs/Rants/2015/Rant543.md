That James Ndu Ngozi debacle on twitter might seem like one big joke, but it is exactly the way (some) Nigerian men act/think.

They are simply in love with themselves. In love with the possibility of loving themselves. Breaking their own hearts. Mending their own hearts. Breaking up with themselves. Making up by themselves. 

They get married to themselves. Achieve orgasm for themselves. Believe their penis is big all by themselves. Convince themselves they are Brad Pitt and chicks are clamouring for a piece of stardom. 

It's exhausting.

The only difference between James and the next dude is the medium he uses to express his obsession with self.

Making up a scam on whether a woman is missing you or not and responding to your own fraud is the lowest of all lows.

Too many men do it in many other ways. When they hang out with friends and give the impression some chick is missing them. 

It's all in the head. Masturbation with very little lubricant. Feeling yourself, hurting yourself, needing yourself.

But in reality, chick is screwing someone else and can barely recall the colour of your butt.

Black. Very black. Caramel. Bleached. Cellulite ridden. Patched. Vanilla.

That is the only reason some dumbfuck will write a post about a girl, criticising her choice of Mr. Biggs for their first meeting, instead of a buka.

The entitlements of the Nigerian man sha!

Mr. Biggs meatpie costs...how much? What - N200?

Yet you judge a girl based on a snack at Mr. Biggs? Ranting shit on social media, measuring the cost of wife material, if it can go round her hips...questioning her motives based on a fucking meatpie. 

I can't deal, mehn.

In his head, she wants him. She wants to marry him. She cannot live without him. She is merely a woman, but with him she can be special.

It's all in the head.

Truth is, James is in many of you.
