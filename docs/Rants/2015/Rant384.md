# Rant384


February 8, 2015

When I found this piece I kept it safe, waiting for nighttime when I'd have the moon and a glass of wine to enjoy Adaobi's good humour and shocking wit. 

Adaobi is controversial. I like it when she talks about “feral scent” from her housemaid and rant about elitism with such annoying optimism. It is something she does quite well.

She is a snotty bourgeois writer with all the perks that demonstrate her status as the black princess of African literature snuggled up to the bosom of the West.

We hate those toffee-nosed pieces, but that hate is actually Love…and acceptance.

Now she sounds like a corny journalist.

Adaobi in her normal exasperating self, would mention how uncool it must be that we are left with the "horrible choices" between GEJ and GMB, while she reminds us what she'd be up to during the election- reading the Times in a house in New York, getting tanned and sipping ice tea.

That’s her edge. At least that’s why I like her.

But all that is missing here. I feel cheated.

This piece could have been written by any well-fed journalist at The Nation newspaper.

A few nods, a few sighs to celebrate her “common sense” (we always like people to stay that way- agreeable), and this article is forgettable.

Mba. Continue to give us colourful pieces with pungent phrases that stay with us years after the link is hard to locate on the internet.
