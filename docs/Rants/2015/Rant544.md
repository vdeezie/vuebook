I spent the morning at my children's school buying new uniforms,  maths sets, textbooks, exercise books and work books...

Paying school fees, lesson fees, extracurricular fees, new school bags...

I was tempted to pay for boarding facilities. I changed my mind. Day students they shall remain. 

I bought a trailer load of books and academic accessories; you'd think I went shopping for electronics - cartons and cartons of books, makes you want to ask: what the hell do pre-teens need all these materials for?!

So anyway...

I have reached my final conclusion on life:

Money is everything. 

Not even love- the much celebrated virtue of all times - can give you this much peace when you know you can afford what-you-are-supposed-to-afford according to the lifestyle you want.

After good health comes money. 

Every other thing you can leave without.

Get money.

My people, don't let anybody deceive you...

Get legit money.
