I have a radio show coming up.

It is called NASCO Moments.

The show, like the NASCO brand, has been successful in the north. And bringing it to Lagos, to a different and more complex audience of cosmopolitan chutzpah, is something that makes me topple over my couch!

The show will kick off in a fortnight.

Of course, I am excited.

When Uche Peter Umez asked me yesterday: “Don’t you ever sleep, rest?”

The answer was easy ‘cos I say it all the time: "I will rest when I die."

First thing I’ll do when I get to heaven is hi-five Jesus, and then ask for the toilet- get all ‘em nasty earthly shit outta my system.

Then take a bath, check out what my mansion looks like. 

Diamond encrusted dresser- check!
Wine cups in pure gold – check!
Bed made from mist; an ethereal feel – double check!

Then I’ll go catch up on the holy choir; finally gospel music as it should be!

Afterwards, check up on God and ask if we can do all the assessing of my life later. 

I mean…I’m here already, so can I at least take a heavenly nap before I am reminded of all the shit I did on earth?

Phew!

Ok.

So what was I saying?

Yes! NASCO Moments!

Yes, yes! Excited I am!

The show is going to tackle societal issues from: the need to have more children than we can afford, to women and career choices, to building solid middle-class finances, to top ways to excel in the city… a whole lot.

But I don’t want just my thoughts, so I’d like to form a small committee of five where we can thrash out 13 topics to carry me through the first quarter of the show.

I don’t know how your schedules are, but I do hope you can squeeze out a Radisson lunch/dinner time with me next week (after #TheConversation) so we can come up with 13 interesting and significant topics.

Bunmi Cynthia Adeleye (for her prolific corporate background with a lot of interpersonal dealings)
Funmi Akinsola (of course, for being the best producer on this side of the globe)
Bimbola Babarinde Amao (for her lifestyle reportage experience)
'Meena Adekoya (because I believe a younger woman should always experience these phenomenal things :D

But in the meantime, if you do have any topic you think a lifestyle show on radio should tackle- that you are passionate about, kindly share.

Thanks y’all.
