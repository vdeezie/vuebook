That we are a people of hand-me-downs and entitlements have not helped in grooming a healthy sense of gratitude and excitement for success.

The only method to our gratitude is servile and sterile. So the emerging mortal in the metropolis who resents that, thinks the reverse- an aloof, conceited stance will look better on her/him as a response to business offers, sponsorships, partnerships, patronages.

We are just a confused lot. We cannot tell what emotions we should carry when it concerns fighting a friend for taking our blouse without permission and, say, getting a person or business to invest in our abilities.

We treat everything with the same detachment. If we displayed any interest in something that could be part of our next level of advancement, we might be judged as too eager or too excited.

That would make the other person superior to us. 

A twisted, sick mind set.

So we are going to just sit back and act like we deserve it. This good luck coming our way… it’s about time.

Nigerians want to get things for free and thank only God.

After all, our churches tell us that God will send any baga to bless us. The key word is: “baga”. Which would mean your appreciation should not go to the human being as he is only an instrument sent by a higher being to elevate your status.

So we are going to pick a call, from someone who wants to patronize our skill, with a cold detached attitude to ensure… “This shouldn’t mean that you are better than me.”

You know? We are demented like that.

It is our culture that permits a 24 year old man a 3-square meal with a roof over his head without a job. 

It is our culture that allows us throw our doors open whenever a friend needs a nap or wants to borrow N10k.

We are spoiled.

It is an observation that makes me terribly sad.

We use emoticons on social media better than our senses.

Go and see how hard an 18 year old works in western societies. The number of ‘nos’ s/he suffers for something as little as a plate of cereals.

I was unfortunately yoked at some point with someone who could not bring himself to be enthusiastic about anything.

Tell him, “You have a message from Malibu for a conference- full expense covered; you will be presenting your proposal to a hundred people and we’ll take it from there”.

That news will be interpreted as blandly as a hot plate of eba and okro waiting to be devoured. 

Same reaction. Bland expression. Ordinary countenance.

Business without enthusiasm is a waste of time.

If you are not bringing in money, at least bring in a jolly bowl of laughter. Bring in hi-fives. Put some sugar in the tea. Jump and shout and work up a contagious outburst.

Or just sound like a human being on the phone.

Come Alive.

What is this long mouth we carry around like we are entitled to good living? Who lied to you?

My brother runs an AD agency. My first ever job after graduation was as a copywriter in his outfit.

My brother taught me enthusiasm. 

When he made a call, his voice was electric. It was almost like he would break into a song. 

When he got invited to pitch for an account, his electrifying demeanour ignited our souls.

He taught me all about passion... and Enthusiasm.

I refuse to work with anyone without enthusiasm.

There are so many mediocre things in life.

Business should not be one of them.
