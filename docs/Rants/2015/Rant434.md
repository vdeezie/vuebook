Do not sell the Beauty ruse to the girl child.

I used to be this mum who would tell her daughters, “you are beautiful” every morning… I got bored.

Also, I realised they couldn’t function without it.

So I stopped.

If a girl child wants to feel ugly or average, it is ok. Let her.

I don’t wake up feeling like Super-Joy everyday. Sometimes I feel like shit, but I still go to work, I still run a great website, I still read all the materials bookmarked for the day, I still get paid; I still pick calls and with my sing-song voice go on and have a good conversation, sounding like the chirpiest bird on a tree. 

And I still come to Facebook to look for trouble.

I do not endorse the beauty mantra. I find that it makes the girl child emotionally needier and insecure. Wanting to hear it ever so often. Seeking validation too soon. Expecting anyone to fill in the void when it isn’t coming from the mother who had once made it an anthem at home.

“You are beautiful” is burdensome. And for most part, it does not build a child’s confidence.

Phrases that do are specific:

“You are a brilliant student. See all your As. Well done.”
“I love that skirt. Work it, girl”
“That hair suits you, darling.”

Precise compliment. Not a vague salute that is said to heal all her problems.

She is going to grow up and find that beauty has no bearing to many great things. 

It will not get you a job (unless otherwise)
It will not get you to birth grand ideas 
It will not give you good friends
Heck! It won't even get you a man. Have you seen how average-looking chicks hold their men down? Dayum! You and your Halle Berry beauty can like to burn LOOOL! (kiddin' kiddin')

Beauty will not pay your rent or take you around the world either (unless otherwise)

And in most cases, we do not want our children to fall under “otherwise”.

People are most likely to move on with their lives if they know they aren’t exactly top 10 most beautiful in da’ hood.

But “beauty” ensures you worry only about its (beauty) pros and cons.

You may not agree, but trust me, you do not want to be Kim Kardashian.

Every wrinkle, every pimple, every sign of cellulite, every hair out of place, every bulge in the wrong place, every paparazzo shot from the wrong angle are things to worry about endlessly.

Who wants a daughter like that?

Best be the plain Jane, accept you are plain Jane, so you can move on to greater things.

-Because truly the whole idea of telling a woman she is beautiful is to ensure she feels that way around men. That makes it, well, against everything new society should stand for.

Do we wake boys up every morning to tell them how handsome they are?

So be ugly if you feel like it. Be tired. Be unsure. 

Succeed anyway.
