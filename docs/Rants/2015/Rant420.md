# Rant420




April 4, 2015

“When I read your rants, I want to rip off your clothes; soak you in water; shut your mouth; and just massage you…
Like there is a spirit in you that needs to be placated.”

Hian oh!

But ayam calmer now nah. 

I haff long passed the baton to others. Many controversial women on Facebook now, forming badass. 

I don’t give a shiii…I don’t care what you thiiiink…My wit is cooler than youuurs…I am angrier than youuu…I don’t care about youuuu…Are you maaaad… Wannabes everywhere.

I do cartoons now; give free tickets and talk about events *coughs*

You won’t believe half the shit that has happened in the last month that I didn’t even bother to address. Not worth it.

But the one I choose to address, I address! Yes ke!

So yes, a massage is in order *heehee*

Jacuzzi tinz plix.
 
Yelz ke!

*flips weave, turns off laptop and heads to the sitting room to watch C&I…counting down to the hour of placation*
