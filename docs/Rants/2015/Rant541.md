Introduce your children to your own realities...

Not your neighbours'.

If you cannot afford cable network, let your children watch what you have. Do not encourage them to peep through windows or beg neighbours to let them in so they can squat at the door, trying to be part of a Disney Channel experience. 

If you can't afford a washing machine, let them wash with their hands. Don't send them begging neighbours to use their facilities. 

Don't ask to heat your lunch with your neighbours' microwave. Use your stove. 

Introduce your child to your own realities- your poverty or your comforts...

As long as it is your own story, it is the right thing to do.

Let us stop raising children with needs that can only be satisfied with other people's realities.

Eat your food without salt if you don't have any salt. 

Cook your meals without fish if you can't afford it.

Let them build toys with bottle corks if you can't buy toys. 

Do not beg for toys. Have some dignity.

Allow them appreciate their reality, their truth, designed by your indolence or industry. 

You cannot explore my DSTV, my fridge, or snoop around for a piece of luxury.

Luxury that is not yours should not be in the life of your children.

You are raising beggars. Entitled beggars. Who believe the world owes them something.

"Can I come and watch Cartoon Network?"

"No, you cannot."

"Why?"

"It is not your reality. You are too young to be covetous. Go home and be content with what is waiting for you there. Watch what your parents can afford."

The only door I will let someone else's child walk through without judgment...

Is the door to my children's library. 

If it is knowledge you seek...

You are welcome.
