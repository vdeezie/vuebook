The deduction of self from the Nigerian issue is part of the larger problem. 

Beyond your preferred party or choice, beyond your candidate and the left arm you are willing to chomp to prove your loyalty or faith (for a man you cannot see his heart or measure his own faith)… beyond all of that, we have failed to have conversations that are non-partisan, rid of political grime.

We are not holding dialogues as a people. We argue, yes. We build intelligent points around our candidates, yes. But are we communicating with the next Nigerian? No, we are not.

We are not building new leaders because we are not holding political discussions that address human beings and their basic needs, complex ideas and communal philosophies. We are holding prayer meetings and political rallies and party crusades- jumping around with ‘these ones’ who have refused to vacate their seats after continuously failing us. This profits only a few- the few it has profited since the start of this Nation.

In their best form, the best of them are still not good enough. People who have become a part of the smothering silence that attacks nothing, cures nothing, fights nothing long enough to effect change. They may not be part of corruption- but have no qualms washing their hands as a sign of disclaiming the act.

Those are not the kind of leaders we want. You are clean, your house is in order, but is your surrounding environment dirt-free?

Recycling people is what our politics thrive on- it is what we are.

If you tell me that you strongly believe any of the parties will come in for another 4 years and give you good roads, affordable and decent public education, clean water, electricity, beat down fuel price, tackle inflation, and resuscitate our lost identity and National dignity, then I would say you are just as delusional as all the promises gushing out of desperate mouths to get your vote.

One of my friends said to me: “I am voting GMB because I do not want to see Jonathan near power. The passion I am pouring into GMB is the same passion I poured into Jonathan-with-no-shoes in 2011. He had his shot, he failed. I am disappointed and it is time to move to the next person until something good happens to this country.” 

I can't even fault that statement no matter how I feel about GMB's ambition. 

She has gone ahead to show her support and passion for her candidate; what more can you ask from a citizen? The most sensible statement that can come out of a situation as sad as Nigeria.

If after 4 years her needs are not met, she runs out of steam, loses hope, becomes antagonistic to all things Nigerian (as some already are), who would blame her? We need conversations to keep us from committing suicide.

Like I said to an actress yesterday, we have all failed this country. This “siddon look” position will cost us a lot more than just basic needs in a few years to come.

Let us start some form of communal dialogue. Amongst the bourgeois (dripping to the lower middle class)… if  Don Jazzy, for instance, hosts 1,000 fans to a non-partisan political dialogue- to change habits, change mind-set, build confidence, enlighten people and their rights… 

If Omotola picks up another 1,000 people and holds her own political conversation that is mainly to educate on the Nigerian state…

If Basketmouth (who is going to be in London on that day running his show, anyway) or Alibaba, gathers 500 people to register their issues in a non-partisan gathering; that builds back-and-forth exchange and trust…

This people have goodwill and over 200,000 followers EACH on social media. I am not talking about sharing rice and garri- I am talking about exchanging ideas, empowering the next Nigerian so he can contribute to a new Nigeria.

If the average Nigerian reaches out to 10 people and hold that conversation…the numbers begin to grow; we begin to educate ourselves better, begin to form richer opinions on politics, begin to see how we fit in, what we can do, where we can begin, positions we can fill- and it doesn’t have to be from your couch to a governorship ticket; it could be setting up an opposition unit that challenges the power of the day. Anything that can move this country forward, one conversation at a time.

We have seen how slowly a group of women (and men) who joined Facebook some years ago… we have seen their thoughts and views take shape; women begin to understand their values beyond childbirth, beyond marriage, beyond even their physical appearances or family orientation. We see them define their own purpose, tossing that filth-of-a-robe that condemns and burdens with unnecessary moods of shame and pity. Embracing their sexuality, accepting their femininity.

It happened because we started that conversation on Facebook. 

Let’s take this political issue a little more personal, and less partisan.
