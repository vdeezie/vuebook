I just skipped another long list of “godly women’ to-do duties in marriage. *sigh*

A list of 30 must-do duties with scriptures to boot.

Let me bore you with some:

1. Never forget that your husband married you, not your maid or anyone else. Do your duties.(Gen 2v24)

2. Never pretend to be sick for the purpose of denying your husband sex. You must give it to him how he wants it. Sex is very important to Men, if you keep denying him, it is a matterif time before another woman takes over theat duty. No man can withstand sex starvation for too long(even the anointed ones) (SS 7v12)

3. Don't forget to check the smartness of your husband before he checks out.(Prov 12v4)

4. Never be in a hurry in the bathroom and on the dressing table. Out there your husband is always surrounded by women who took their time on their looks.( 1 Sam25v3)

And the list goes on and on into depths of absurdity…

*sigh*

There’s nothing decent or kind about how Christianity is practised in Nigeria.

When a man of god climbs the pulpit and begins to admonish women to “submit”…

It is a tactless and irresponsible act. You are a bully.

It is not in your place as a man to worry about a woman. Let women worry about themselves.

Focus on your gender. Focus on the men.

What does the Bible tell husbands?

“Love your wife, like Christ loves the church”

The process of marriage would require Love first, before submission.

But for some daft reasons, pastors are interested more on whether the woman speaks back to her husband, offers him dinner on her knees and/or surrenders her pay cheque every month.

To submit is the easiest thing to do. If you hunt for the deer, heck I will cook you a meal! Simple!

It is the token that comes from real Love.

How did Christ love the church?

He died, negro. He died for this love.

Jesus died for the church. What does that mean for the husband?

It means your wife first before anything- before the air you breathe, before your needs. 

In bed, before your satisfaction. Before your orgasm.

In making decisions, before your success; before your glory. You move town, forsake your own job when she gets a new offer in another city.

When you get there, as she settles into her new office, you start to scramble for a new job.

You risk your own comfort for her.

Jesus was shamed and beaten for his Love. 

What would Jesus do in a marriage with a woman who works just as hard as he does?

He would make her dinner. 

No, not the bloody houseboy! Send the skunk out of your house and make the dinner yourself.

What do you need another adult male with a penis cluttering your space because you are too lazy to Love? To be like Christ?

Jesus would surrender his salary to his wife and tell her to do as she pleases for the good of the home and the kids.

Jesus wouldn’t cheat. He wouldn’t stamp his authority around. And, by God, he will not be a fucking broke ass.

Are you Jesus in your marriage?

Pastors, are you grooming mini-Jesus in your congregation, amongst your men?

Get a 50 long to-do list for men on how to love their wives.

That’s your job.

Being a narcissistic clown, stamping your feet on the pulpit asking for women to “submit, submit, submit…” is not going to change a thing. The deep yawn many marriages have become has nothing to do with welcoming your man with a cup of water at the door every night.

Look at the vermin you are raising- men with no ambition, no direction, no concrete plans…clueless, aimless, bewildered; all wishing for a woman to submit to their mediocrity.

Your cart comes first before the horse. No matter how you try, that method is flawed.

Skip all your “Wise woman in Marriage” sermons; dump the “for godly women” special service. You've been having that for years, why don't you apply some wisdom? Change your damn sermon.

Women are NOT your problem.

Fix your own gender.

Then when the job is done, and your men know what Christ kind of love is…

We can come back and see if there’s any woman left without the joy of sucking a dick.
