Our options in Nigeria are always tedious, colourless

You either go to school OR you become a vulcanizer 

You either get a 9-5 job OR you go into music OR suffer through the delusion of being a “businessman” 

You either have a child OR go for deliverance

You either get married OR die

You are either going to church OR going clubbing

You either write in a certain way OR don’t write at all

You either support PDP or APC

You either want a 70 year old man to lead you (someone who should be retired in a rural camp feeding cattle; someone who has made violent fanatical utterances in the past) OR bring back the weary clueless one.

It is this miserly choices that confine our creativity and confidence to ask for more/better; these miserable options continue to make us sound like retards when we argue.

The only argument we should be having is: Don’t we deserve better than these wretched options?

Don’t you?

You either go to public school with teachers selling bra-and-pant and faux jewellery for survival OR you spend your entire worth getting a private education for your kids.

No in-betweens… we are in serious dearth of alternatives, but we are so consumed by our lack we carry on with pseudo-intellectual discuss and debates of cringe-worthy benefit. 

What can a 70 year old man offer you? This multifaceted, frenzied, complex society with 99 problems plus one- what is left of his imagination except to be an “elder” in a corner of his house, sharing tales of heroic deeds of the past with grandchildren and neighbours.

We continue to debate endlessly over options that should be obsolete and embarrassing. Like a bowl of soggy beans tossed at us. Prisoners of our own lack of quest.

PS: I don't have a voters' card. These options are no options. If this is what we have, then we have nothing. If it is too much to ask: that "these people" do not "Islamize" Nigeria. Then we continue in our 400-year slavery, until Moses appears. I'm fine. 

Hopefully, he'll be able to pee without difficulty.
