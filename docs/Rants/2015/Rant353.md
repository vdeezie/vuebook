January 13, 2015

I woke up thinking about this:

I have two phones, I have never been able to recall the number of one of them.

It’s deliberate languor on my part

After all, all I do is run around my house in shorts…

I am not running for President

Ok. So maybe we can forgive that. 11 digits might really be too long a task for a 70+ to remember. With aging comes affliction.

But when he cannot remember his Vice President’s name…

LOL! Surely I am allowed to laugh at this point, no?

Maybe he is thinking of how to tame his brothers in the North…or reduce oil price so badly that he can’t even remember the name of the man he is supposed to be making these ground-breaking solutions with. Who knows? *side eyes*

See ehn, I’m not even mad. I understand why anyone would support this joke…

You are tired of the dawdling pace, the docility of the Nigerian state, and at this moment anything would do just to rid you of this trouble.

It just seems to me this poor man is being pawned by the real dealers of this country, with ulterior motives.

How do you have the opportunities and goodwill of Fashola and the exceptional damage control Oshiomole gives and the best you present as a party is that one person with slurred speech who looks easy to influence; where trailer loads of corruption will pass under his nose and he will not remember if he dreamt it or he imagined it (they will whisper to him that he is about to suffer dementia)

It’s not like the present situation is any better, but just be sure you are not trading your tattered shoes for plantar warts.

-Because, really, to prove the incompetence of this present administration, you could have slammed Nigerians with a candidate they cannot resist. Remember how Fashola won his second term all on his own terms, even when it seemed Asiwaju would rather have a more agreeable protégé? Lagosians would have fried Tinubu's skull. He had to agree with the people and go lick his ego some place, counting down to 2015.

But here is Buhari with no memorabilia. All this years contesting to seat in Aso Rock, he did not take the time to groom younger (wo)men with mental and physical oomph to take over. Did not start up any kind of campaign against the issues in the North. His voice was inaudible during the attacks. While Ezekwesili was sitting on grass bemoaning the faith of little girls, he was still obsessed with becoming president.

Must you be president when what you need is Valium?
