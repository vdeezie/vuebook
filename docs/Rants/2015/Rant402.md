Two things...

1. I got a N25k NEPA bill in a month I didn't switch on my TV or A/C because I was hardly ever at home and there was hardly ever electricity. A month where I had to queue for fuel to leave the generator running while I dash in and out of time so my fridge will not turn to a coffin for rotten meat. Nigeria, I hail thee!

2. I am still trying to make a connection between failure and WhatsApp. I am convinced that platform was built to keep us satisfied with less-than-average performance. A pat on the back for every trifling "success", lengthy discussions on every flimsy issue that demands your input. Haba! Nobody built a house by exchanging endless pleasantries on WhatsApp. People just never stop chatting. They just never stop. So when do you get work done?
