LOL! These children ehn!

So my older daughter says she has to rehearse for a debating session on…

“Grandmothers raise better kids than Mothers.”

She gets to choose a camp- for or against Mothers.

Interesting. Hmm!

So I ask, “where will you stand?”

She blinks and says, “I think I’ll go with, errr, Grandmothers.”

“Whaaaat?!”

Now she is laughing… “It’s not like that oh. I just think I can get more points if I camp with Grandmothers.”

“Hmmmph! So what points will you be raising?” I am genuinely shocked oh. This babe is choosing her grandmother over me!

“With grandmothers you are more disciplined. They raise children who are not spoilt,” she says.

“I beg your pardon! Do I spoil you?!”

“Well…you give us everything.”

“So? What you ask for is nothing nah. Should I say 'no' when you want a new bag or a new top or want to watch a movie?”'

“Mummy, it’s not like that. It’s just debate. I want to win and if I stay on the grandmothers’ side, I can raise more points to win. That’s all.”

Now I am sulking. “But you just said I spoil you.”

“Grandma says it all the time nah. It’s no big deal. I guess it is because you give us everything.”

“That is what a mother does nah. It’s not like you are asking for a brand new car or a plane.”

Then we hear the screeching sound of my younger daughter, lying on a couch in the sitting room, watching “Sophia The First” and chewing biscuits.

“I am not complaining ooooooh! Ife what are you saying over there? Are we complaining?”

The older one replies, “No, we are not!”

“I love you mummy. Don't mind Ife,” the younger one cries from the sitting room.

“I hear you!” I respond.

“It’s just Debate. I gotta win this. Sowwee” my older daughter whispers and walks away.

It is well.
