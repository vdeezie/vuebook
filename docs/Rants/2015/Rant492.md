#TheConversation: Frequently Asked Question...

I get this alot: "How do you manage to handle the negative opinions and outright hate that comes with a project like this?"

I don't handle opinions. I don't handle hate. It's not something I try to analyse. 

There's an energy to hate that I think we need to tap into.

Or maybe I am just weird.

But I have never achieved anything based on my mother's love or the love of friends. 

Hate, however, births ingenuity.

I think we should crave hate- not as a hater but as a "hatee".  

If we allow the energy behind ill feeling work through us, we would recognise that it births more phenomenal results than any kind of emotion.

Love/like inhabits a lazy comfort. Hate, however, defies the limits that love programmes you to accept.

Hate is the test/trial you have to confront that will manifest in ways even you will be amazed.

We grow up with certain instructions and we stick to them without question. 

Why do you think you need more love than hate? 

Have you ever questioned that logic? 

I have. And I think it is false.

We need more hate.

Check everyone who tried harder...who gave a little more to life... 

It wasn't because they had a sweet husband/wife- sweet spouses are for great sex.

It wasn't because they were described as lovable, nice, meek (by all means embrace these virtues if that is what you are about; do you!)

My point is: People who rose above everything from within their spirit were those who were caught up in devastating situations, terrible/hateful discoveries like HIV, cancer, paralysis or losing a major part of themselves that they never thought they could be without.

Ok. Maybe not too dramatic. Hate, even just as basic as people not liking you is the best push you can get. Don't be stuck on worrying about how to please people, how to be described as a nice person that you fail to recognise the goldmine in the industry of Hate.

Invest in it. Buy shares- as a delightful "hatee".

Stop trying to stop people from not liking you. Stop adjusting your life to the tune that will, hopefully, get someone to say: "she is so nice." Unless that is your goal, then you are on track.

People who rely on love win prom queen and a bunch of friends.

People who were bullied in school become game changers. Have you not read half of the stories of people who had to do what they had to do because nobody liked them enough?

You don't need too much love...

You need a lot of hate.

The kind of hate that is baseless, spread across idiots like cancer, is what you need.

So don't wish it away; and please don't EVER try to explain yourself to get liked.

Embrace hate.

It will trigger insane reaction in your system, like a drug (something close to what Bradley Cooper took in "Limitless"), and you would find yourself within the capacity of distinction.
