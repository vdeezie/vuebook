I got this mail:

“Joy, what do I need to do to become a feminist?”

My response:

When you put it that way, it makes it sound like a cult or a religion. Feminism from where I stand is none of these.

Feminism is a decision. 

And the first thing you need to do is drop the toga of Shame.

The woman is robed in shame the minute she enters the world as a little girl.

“Sit properly, don’t you know you are a girl?”
“That dress is showing your breasts too much, find something else to wear.”
“Don’t talk to boys, you will get pregnant!”
“Stop talking too much, no man will marry you with all these opinions you share!”
“Be seen, not heard. Your inner beauty should surpass all this gragra you are doing.”
“Your voice is too loud, be ladylike!”
“Don’t earn more than the man.”
“Let the man make the move, bury your desires.”

It goes on and on, backed doggedly by (other) women.

The female child is mocked for almost anything that doesn’t fit a stereotype.

When you lose that Shame, you gain freedom.

Jesus says it well nah: “Lose your soul, gain eternal life.”

Toss the robe of Shame into the nearest bin, and walk into freedom.

Love your body, love your needs- they are valid; don’t be ashamed to choose a career over cooking for a man; don’t be shy to succeed greater than the next person.

Ride the car you want; wear the dress that accentuates your sexy assets; be loud if you want to be; drink a bottle of Vodka; pay for your dinner; talk about sex and fulfil your fantasies; have crazy opinions; change your mind over and over again…

Bottom line: get rid of the humiliation you were born with as one with a vagina and succulent breasts.

To be a woman is nothing to be ashamed of.

That is my feminism.
