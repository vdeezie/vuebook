My older daughter wears a straw hat to school. With a blazer. Pleated skirt and a tie. Black socks and shoes I could wear to a fancy date.

A package that shoots the school bill up by over 30%

She now closes by 4.30pm, like an executive intern.

What they are learning that requires a child to sit through a class everyday till the sun begs for a nap... I don’t know.

This gives my younger daughter, 8 year-old Jolade, an hour 30 minutes of wait- to shake her legs, read a novel, yawn repeatedly or bore herself with nothing to do.

So to keep her busy whilst she waits for her sister, she decided- on her own- to join the lesson class that happens after the first lesson class that happens after the real class.

So in certain schools like theirs, parents pay for school fees, pay for mandatory lesson fees, then have to pay the teacher privately for extra lesson.

You would think our children come without a speck of brain. All this learning- a pack of useless theories...

It’s a flawed system. We know it is ridiculous, but we play along to create faux peace and acceptable pretense. 

On Friday, she joined the lesson and her teacher wanted to know if she had spoken to me.

“My mum will pay,” she responded.

What kind of response is that, biko? LOL! I will have to talk to her about having such confidence that gives the impression of a money tree growing at our backyard.

Teacher calls me to officially present the option of her having lessons until her older sister's 4.30 close hour.

Teacher is male.

I ask too many questions in one breath- How many (other) students does he teach after school? How many girls?

He has three students. My daughter would make four.

My paranoia leads me to an article I was tagged in, about a bloody teacher who molests the students in his care.

Full of rage, I call my mum. I couldn’t wait any minute longer, I had to speak to Jolade.

“Hi honey, you are starting private lessons officially with the other students on Monday, not because I think you need it but you have to keep busy while your sister is in class.”

“Ok.”

“Now listen, your teacher has no right to touch you, ok?”

Silence.

"Can you hear me?!"

“Yes, mummy. I know.”

“If he touches you, you run out of that class and report to the next teacher you see. The minute grandma picks you up, you tell her and call me immediately. You get that?”

“Yes, mummy.”

“You be safe, ok?”

“Yes, mummy.”

“You tell me if anything happens. You pick up the phone and you call me!”

“Nothing will happen,” she responded.

Silence.

"Mummy, can you hear me? I said nothing will happen.”

I tear up inside.

“Ok. Love you."

I think I’ll have Colonades rice and fish peppersoup to heal my anxiety.
