# Rant575


December 7, 2015

(Older) women grudgingly accept me when we (finally) meet...

They want to see anger, skin begging for moisturizer, dirty baggy jeans, hair-of-a-certain-kind, croaky voice, eyes that burn and sting, brown dentition, stale breath.

They are looking for extra weight. The I-don't-care-what-anyone-thinks-about-bushy-eyebrows.

They want an appearance to justify my rants. 

Or maybe it's the experience?

Did she have a violent marriage? Any tortuous male tale?

None.

I have experienced some of the easiest transitions from dating to single-hood. 

I did not give my school fees to any fucking boy... I do not give to men. Period. 

She has to be wild or where does she find all that energy in those rants?

And it breaks their hearts when they discover I don't drink or smoke or even hold social conversations.

I am not the life of the party.

I don't even like parties.

I've been to clubs probably 5 times my entirely life.

And weddings, probably 6 times. Including mine.

After an hour or two, I itch for my own company. I want to get rid of everyone around me. And just be alone.

With music. With a book. Or with my thoughts. 

My thoughts are special.

I am yet to have a full week of sex without any breaks my entirely life. 

I am ordinary-ish.

No gruesome tale. No out-of-order appearance. No alcohol. No pot.

Not even a wild sexual story. 

Not one extraordinary tale to justify my ruthless feminism and passionate stance.

I am a fraud. 

Men still want to take me to Dubai.

I had considered being a live-in-lover a while back because the man proposed and loves me good.

I get gifts. Too many. Dates. Surprises.

A bed had been layered with flowers just to show how beautiful someone thought having me in his life was.

I put a yellow dress up and every man wants to spend Christmas with me.

How do you reconcile this with these rants fighting for experiences she has never lived? They wonder.

They despise that. I am in no position to fight for something I have not had.

I watch and their eyes dart from one end of lunch table to the other. 

This Joy is no fun. Not even a sip of vodka has passed down her throat. So what justifies this rage on social media?

I watch as they move from total worship (I get that alot), to feeling used by a woman who has never had a black eye.

They have been duped.

Eventually they will re-appear with a vengeance.

They become bullies. Mockers. 

And that's where problem starts.

I don't care how old you are...

Nobody bullies me.
