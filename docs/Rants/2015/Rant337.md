I am Nigerian
The roads are bad- perpetually bad. When it is fixed, it is fixed for only a season, until a new contract has to be signed, and money is diverted and used for personal entertainment by a few.

I am Nigerian.
I attended a Nigerian tertiary institution. Prisons abroad have better facilities than all the universities in this country put together.

I am Nigerian.
I provide my own water, my own security, my own electricity, my own entertainment. Look at NTA! That people still count on its reach as anything is just as sick as the obsolete equipment and political control it is burdened with. That is the kind of sick faith we have- we keep going back to that rut to record shows.

I am Nigerian.
I know that 90% of political knockers and decriers will come face to face with people in authority and will lose their voices and spark; they will concentrate on how humble and knowledgeable he sounds... and of course, admire his shirt or watch, or her flawless skin. All your fight on social media will lose its ting.

I am Nigerian, you are not more Nigerian than I am.

I live here, I know this country. I know its people. And I know it is not yet uhuru.

So when I say I did not stand under the sun to get numbered or registered, it is to my triumph- that I will not be deluded enough to think a bunch of Nollywood-ers running for HOA and another bunch of old retirees and another bunch of timid under-funded individuals will be able or mentally equipped to change my life.

This is the country of my birth. My mother ran her republic, I am running mine. Hopefully, I kick my kids out of this hole to a more structured environment soon enough so they can actually know what it feels like to be a citizen of a nation.

You want me to hold a voters’ card to authenticate my hope for this nation? Sorry, I have poured my hope in something else.

You will still chew on your disappointment like you always have- 4 years down the line. I do not share in blind optimism; we suffer that already with religion.

When I SEE change, I will follow.

For now, just stay on your lane ehn? 

Your streets will not be repaired, your electricity is beyond what one old man can promise; these institutions are perforated with corruption that will take decades and a complete lunatic with energy, zeal, stubborn knowledge, perfect political ignorance and YOUTH, to correct.

He may die trying, but he will make enough progress that will give “Joshua” a level of stability to ride on.

Politics is not practiced on social media. If you want good roads in your local government, close your Facebook and twitter account and go out there and die for what you want- for your children’s sake. Stop making mouth and enemies here.

I don’t want anything from this country. I just want to be left alone with my scepticism and total lack of faith.

And yes, I DID NOT REGSITER!

When I see what that card can afford YOU who did, then we'll take it from there.
