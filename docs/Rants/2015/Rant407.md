So LASMOCK Almuni ‘95 held a fundraising event today at our secondary school in Kankon, Badagry.

20 years later and LASMOCK has, well, changed *sigh*

No fancy library, no equipped clinic, no cool grocery store. Like the story of Nigeria, maintenance is at a low.

We are raising N5million to fix the library. So far, we have just about N1 million… 

I was the library prefect in 1995, and there in the audience today was the one teacher who believed in me like it was impossible for me to fail.

“You will succeed greatly, Joy,” the English teacher- Mr. Asaolu used to say.

So with the privilege of being the MC of the event, I raved about him nonstop.

While I was mostly upset with the state of the school presently, my heart broke into happy tears when the principal, during his opening speech, called out the A-listers of the school who constantly have the best grades in the entire country- 12 brilliant kids.

These children are top in Nigeria. Even with the peculiar issues they suffer under the "Nigerian neglect" of its youth, they stand tall.

My people I was so emotional, I didn’t know when I announced I’ll give each child N10,000 for being consistent top graders oh!

It was the riotous applause that sunk it in LOL!

But I am glad. Very much so!

Promise will be fulfilled of course; and I would love to keep in touch with them personally; monitor their progress and ensure they don’t lose that winning element.

Nothing excites me like smart children.

This is my first charity move. And I think, in some ways, it was inspired by Mirian Chibuzor Azubuike- the girl who found water and made a community of 6,000 people experience the delight of clean water… then wrote a brilliant and inspiring book about it!

It feels good giving. Even when I could come up with a million excuses why I shouldn’t.

Oh whattafeelin’
