Luxembourg Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, and his partner Gauthier Destenay are married.

As long as it is legal.

Be happy for them.

If it is too much to ask, then look the other way. There are 999,999 other problems to worry about- Boko haram, the economy, child mortality rate, religion, your family, your health, your personal wallet, your own love life you’ve been patching like a threadbare sack, your rent, your child’s education, your weight… you catch my drift?

See that smile. Some heterosexual marriages, with the husband in front and the wife dragging three children behind, heading to church, have not shared a laughter so genuine in years…

But they have a bible verse to condemn these ones to eternal hell.

Life, with an average spouse, is already hell.

Many of you are living it…yet you judge.

You judge someone else’s LEGAL decisions.

I am detached from all of that. Age has taught me that my opinions and judgments are useless. They reveal profound ignorance and misery. And I cannot use it at the counter to buy anything. It has no value.

I may not understand homosexuality…

But I don’t understand how a rocket gets to the moon either; so what?

Who are we to understand everything?

My job is to mind my business; and let others live their lives as they please.

As long as a child or an animal is not involved.

If adults make lawful decisions- smile, frown, nod, shake your head… do whatever!

Go back and deal with that giant sequoia growing inside your eye.
