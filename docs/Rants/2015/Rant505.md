I was waiting for Games of Throne on Mnet Edge one evening when I realised I would have to settle for a less debauched series.

When all the demons inside of you want to suck blood but you are offered water instead *sigh*

I was enraged, but I watched anyway and caught a bit of what was going on…

And this is the story:

A family took a close friend to court over the assumption that he was mean to their child- a 5 year old boy who was smacked by this family friend “secretly” at a public barbecue party (I think they saw a picture with his hands slightly raised, close to the boy's shoulder).

The case took days. The judge, clearly irritated, sat on it like a wet cloth.

Finally, judgment day…

Judge pulled her glasses to the tip of her nose, squinted at the father and mother of the “victim”…

“Your child is your responsibility. If you decide to hold a party and he drifts away from your view and gets smacked, you play a role in all of that. So he was smacked, you are upset, I get it…

“Now if you will excuse me, I have another case to attend to- a 9 year old girl who was raped and beaten…

“This world doesn’t rotate around your minor issues…

“Now get out of my court.”
*** 
This brings me to our issues and non-issues on patriarchy...

There are young girls who are being denied education...
Forced marriages with under-aged girls are ripe in places like Africa and Asia...
A woman is being battered in a relationship and would rather die in there than leave...
A lecturer is, at the moment, riding on top of a student- counting his orgasms and the scores he wishes to give her, making sure he bears no losses...
Some relative is raping a child and the mother is looking the other way because she needs to protect her "home"... 
A woman is going to parade naked for not being virtuous enough to a man with no virtue…

There are issues in this world that the girl child has to pay for.

I know a family of nine children, a housewife and a pure-water mini-truck-driving husband… I only just learned she has a degree. Poverty has built a shrine in their home. Girl children who roam around and are exposed to all kinds of mess.

There’s work to be done.

This world does not rotate around our minor issues on social media- whether you agree on the technique or the definition of patriarchy from your laptops is your business.

And I borrow from the judge:

A 12 year old girl is pregnant and is being mocked. The 50-something year old neighbour responsible for this still gets to eat hot supper every night from a wife who is aware of what he did, yet fucks him to satisfaction in an attempt to makeup for her role in his offence- probably her vagina is "slack" and she needs to work that dick harder… that way he can stay faithful (Shocked? You don't know half the things women cook up to justify a man's shit).

She is going to bring up her daughters in that fashion.

And we are here arguing about how we can be friends or enemies (or mainly frenemies) over a cup of Feminist banter????!!!!! 

The world is watching.

There are major issues to discuss.

Now get out of my court.
