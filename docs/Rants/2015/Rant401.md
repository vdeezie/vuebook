# Rant401


March 9, 2015

Let me just drop this here:

When I did “This Art Is Enough”...

I saw the subs, the “narcissist” subs

(Joy Isi Bewaji presents)… "Oh that is so narcissist”

But you will come and perform on my stage.

Sell shit on my platform- selling better than anywhere else your ass has been to.

You are like the experiment I need to conduct to let people see how stupidity looks like.

I just can’t take Twitter seriously.

The place where people fuck, sub their Exes, and proclaim “my baby is a blessing to me”

All in one month!

LMAO!

Foolish never looked so damn good.

You wear it well.

Oh and by the way, when my #Rants get to 500, I'm throwing a fucking party- drinks and music and a narcissistic helluva good time!

Because I can.
