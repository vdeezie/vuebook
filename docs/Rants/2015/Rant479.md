I will not lie, it is a struggle for me to accept misogyny in pop music. 

I know there's sexual objectification; women with wide buttocks and boobs that can serve as parachute driving the crowd wild, but...

These women LOVE it!

They like their jobs.

I think there's a thinly disguised need for men and women to be objectified. 

If I've been working out at the gym, I want someone to tell me... "you've lost weight. It suits you."

Or something that directs you to my legs or the round of my breasts...especially if it is someone you like.

If you are not liked, don't even go there! God will punish you if you go there!

The lines of misogyny are thin, they fall over plain issues of, say, body worship; which, well, can be a turn on.

Some of these vixens wouldn't trade their stripper pole for your day job.

Adults have a right to decide if they want their buttocks smacked with money by hip hop artistes or sit at a desk and earn a pay cheque.

I know someone who was approached to do a video that was simply going to yap about how "your body they make me shake oooh"... and she was flattered. 

A hardworking corporate woman. She was contemplating taking the role. 

I didn't see anything wrong with it. As long as it was what she wanted.

Do you know some people like violent sex? Do you know some like to be rewarded with a gift after sex? Some form of appreciation for having all the curves in all the right places (LMAO).

Our sexual needs are perverse; and they find good interpretation in music. Mainly hip hop. That's why it seems like an expos√® of which we need to deny or dislike. 

"I can't get you out of my mind. I just want to kiss you...or fuck you..." is a huge compliment for some if it is coming from someone they like. 

Vixens like hip hop. They want to have kids with these artistes. Heck, even the average 20 year old wants to be a babymama, with hopes of transitioning into wifey status with a pop star.

So her fat ass on his face is what she likes. She really does. 

So who are we to label that experience as misogynistic or sexist?

Even successful female hip hop artistes, like Nicki Minaj, who can decide to change the rhythm, endorse it with even bigger butts- injected with tissue to fit in.

Have you seen/heard Cynthia Morgan's "German Juice"?

The lyrics? "They want the girl with the biggest behind..."

And the other song... "shake that body if you've got back like Toolz"

And there are women all over her crib shaking ass like "bar beach water" about to attack its shores.

Biko don't give too much credit to an industry that thinks mainly with its dick.

As long as minors are not required (we know they are but that is another topic entirely), music and women will always walk on the thin line of what we think is right and what people like to do.
