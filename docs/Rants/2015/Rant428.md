“Mummy, why are you crying?”

“It is this film I just watched oh”

“What film?”

“On AfricaMagic. The actress suffeeeeer. Chei!”

(I want to laugh…but I clear my throat instead)

“Which actress?”

(Ini Edo. Ini Edo. Ini Edo…ringing in my head)

“Omotola!" my mum said, "She suffer, but God won the battle for her.”

“Oya tell me the story…”

(Let’s just say I was feeling as light as a piece of paper that day; so Nollywood humour can do me no harm)

“Hmmm! Isi… that was how Omotola married this man who looooved her. Chei! If you see their love- sweet somtin-“

“Ehen!”

“Yes. Sweet love laik dat. Until bad people enter the matter and accused her of cheating. And she was pregnant oh! Ha! That was how her husband beat her, abused her and pursued her out of the house. She cried and fought to stay but he pushed her. Chei! The tin pain me!”

“Eeyah!”

“When she left, she cried and suffeeeered. And her husband then married her best friend oh; not knowing that best friend was part of the scheme to kick Omotola out. But Omotola suffeeeeered. Returned to the village and cried everyday. Prayed everyday.”

“So how did it end?”

“A pastor finally revealed tinz to her husband; and he realised Omotola was innocent, and he rushed back to bring back his wife.”

“And she came back, abi?”

“Yes oh! Beautiful moment. I was so happy that she won eventually.”

*sighs*

I love my mum, she is in her mid-60s; so it is ok for her to feel this way about stories of this sort.

This, however, is why I do not allow my children watch Nollywood. 

I know there are many “Nollywood activists” selling their own story, but if you deny that 90% of the work is still a crisp pack of misogyny, then well, I’ll understand you’re just grateful to have a job and are blind to everything else.

That too is ok. Whatever.

It is exasperating enough to have the stories of how mothers-are-supposed-to-sit-at-home-and-clean-the-floor and fathers-are-supposed-to-go-to-work in social studies textbooks, it is another thing entirely to PAY for DSTV and have them teach our kids that it is ok to be slapped and kicked in marriage…only to return to the place of your abuse and be termed a “heroine”.

And grandmothers are cheering and crying tears of joy. Why? Because a man took a woman back after calling her a whore. She should be grateful. Answered prayers.

Where is the victory in that loaf of shit? Nowhere.

Why did Omotola “suffeeeeer”? Because she left a man who beat her up on false charge.

Why did she go to the village after being kicked out of a house? Why didn't she get a job, get a life? Because it is Nollywood and women are constantly portrayed as unfit to do anything except be married and subservient.

Why did she return? Because husband calleth.

Why, pray tell, is my mother crying? Because Nollywood makes her believe this is an oh-so romantic story.

I’m done.
