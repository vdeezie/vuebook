Stella Damasus asks: How do we keep a man?

Stella Damasus answers: Men do not want you to make it obvious that you are smarter than they are, even if you are. They are our first babies who desire love and affirmation, whether you like it or not.

I will NEVER forgive Stella Damasus for this asinine response borne out of deep-seated reckless ignorance.

I will never ever forgive her.

Let her and her ilk look into the eyes of a young girl child and repeat this nonsense:

"Do not act smarter than a boy. He is your baby."

Society is decorated with the consequences of such astoundingly idiotic opinions. Look everywhere and see the very poor choices women are making because they are too afraid to stand out lest they be called aggressive.

This is a baby in the picture. A girl child. SHE is the one in need of affirmation and love whether we like it or not.

Men and women are adults; they are not babies. Stop making excuses for men then blame it on the woman.

Did you see the long-ass list she made up on how to keep a man many months back?

Can someone tell her to draw up a longer list on how to be a successful woman in the arts?

Priorities, Negroes.
