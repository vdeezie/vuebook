People. Never. Change.

Time never changed anyone.

You will earn droopy breasts, grey hair, wrinkles on your forehead, cellulite on your butt, stretch marks on your thighs…

But time will not change who you are. 

Time is not a counsellor. It really isn’t looking your way. So why would we accord it the responsibility of making an idiot , for instance, a “wonderful person” after many years.

Time will fail you and your expectations of the next person.

So when you meet up 20 years later, you will still have to confront the same issues you confronted as a teenager…

Who is dating who?
Is she good enough for him?
Is he sleeping with her?
Who needs to be careful?
Who can suck up to an ass faster than anyone else?
Who is smooching who by midnight?
Which clique should I belong in?
What can we gossip about?
Whose life should we poke with foul words?

When it comes to attitude and personal demons, there are no cures.

Time can’t help you.

Years is just time-wasting

We never change.

We only grow older. And our attitude grows with us.

No surprises there.

The obsessions. The hate. The lies. The unnecessary bad-belle remains.

Because Time, in itself, is just the tick of an inanimate object, recording seconds and minutes, and will not cure you of chronic idiocy

...or the ability to mind your business.
