# Rant229


September 21, 2014

It's midnight and I am awake, thinking of journalists with tired blue jeans and ugly shoes...

Some years back when the so-called “Young Nigerians” started their “I love Nigeria” campaign with accents in high fermentation, I thought it a fat joke

-Because when that silly shallow proclamation became a tool for bullying and some kind of anaesthetic drug, it had turned on its head too soon like a gorilla on crack when it entered the streets of Victoria Island; and like many causes that plead for the "Island endorsement", it was rid of its essence quickly

Like the #bringbackourgirls campaign, it became a trendy accessory- like buying a new pair of jimmy choo

I hated the whole movement , and couldn’t stand half of the people behind it

You almost get lynched for not being a zombie behind their empty crusade

I know how many times people were harassed to just accept that they were in love with Nigeria

If you asked too many questions they’ll push you under the truck on twitter

But did they have any idea what they were ranting about?

Of course not.

Was I surprised?

Definitely not.

To live in Nigeria and live without hypertension like me, you have to study the people

When you study, then you can understand

When you understand, then you can throw every single garbage they are made of out of your window and live your life

I went for motivational seminars with their architectural wonder of what Oshodi would look like in 2015, something like a fancy Dubai hub

2015 is here.

Talk talk talk. Scrape rotten accents off dead animals. Bully on social media. Form idiotic cliques. And talk some more.

I was actually heading to beggarly journalists selling their conscience over N50k prize money, but I cant make the connection at this point

That is what Nigeria does to you- you go round in circles and make no progress

I just hate this country so bad

And I hated it more when all those stupid chic Nigerians wanted me to love it.

You have silly pictures of Mafoluku looking like Los Angeles

You are selling your dreams without any plans on how you are going to get there

The country is still a shithole of corruption, and politicians are the LEAST corrupt

The average Nigerian will compromise everything he stands for with just N2k dangling in front of him

Just N2k and he’ll lie, cheat, curse, swear; perverted and depraved souls

Now look at these journalists, people who can barely string two intelligent sentences together; read their copy-and-paste press releases and DIE!

How my children will grow up and meet this mess is what brings tears to my eyes.

I am tired.

People are dead and you spit on their grave with money that is not enough to buy a decent coffin.

Are we still talking about politicians?

Why do you criticize a man who sees N100m and pockets N50m?

You should criticize the one who sees N50k in the midst of dead bodies and is able to clean the blood off the miserable notes to buy fuel.
