Nowadays, when I fry the ingredients: tomatoes, pepper and onions- the groundwork for the whisked eggs that should follow into the pan, to go with boiled yam or fried plantain, my kids start to beg from a distance:

“Noooo mummy! No eggs, pleeeease! We want the sauce like thaaaat!”

Bottles of Ribena, cans of Lucozade boost, Fanta, juice sachets… 

They sit in the fridge for weeks! They want none of that anymore.

Spaghetti? No!

Potato chips? No!

Meat pie? Hell No! 

Cornflakes? No!

Moimoi? Noooo! 

What is this phase called, please?

Pre-teen life crisis???
