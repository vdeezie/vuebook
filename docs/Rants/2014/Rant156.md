These are times for lonely wombs.

You wait…

Wait...until you are confident the foundation of underdevelopment can bear to support one more human being.

Just wait…

And be happy you have only a bag to carry over your head when you need to run...

Run...from the madness, the contagion.

Be happy, you without child.

"For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'"- Luke 23:29
