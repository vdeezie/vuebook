It was yesterday, whilst rehearsals were on, that the producer jokingly charged the glitterati presenter to make certain gestures at the camera…

Quickly she declined, “I won’t do that, viewers are going to hate me.”

So I told her, as quickly as she blurted her reservations, that she should not strive to be “liked”.

It is such an annoying word.

I believe strongly that the human obsession to be “liked” is the easiest way to fail.

Take Toke Makinwa for instance- her career is built on Hate.

Whatever you may conceive her to be, putting into consideration the short time she was able to turn a basic job into a star-strutting stage with endorsement perks and all the glittery bric-a-brac that comes from taking advantage of the hour- positioning yourself perfectly well on the stage for fame, she has made quite an impressive triumph of her moment.

I have heard Toke's story. What we know, like so many others, is what we see now- the tangible we can hold on to. Her journey has been a fight for fame and recognition. From one audition to the other, turned down a hundred times. Even the confidence to alter her complexion is part of the hustle, part of what she succeeded at perfecting.

It is (her) success. And she excels in it.

If you insist she is average, I will not argue with that; but it is average talent buttered with desperate Hate (from others) that has brought her this far (someone who was once turned down by "Moments with Mo" now gets special invitation to co-host the show and many others on Mo Abudu's platform, amongst other organizations hoping to feed from her unique recipe). 

Average talent and “Like” is a terrible uninspiring mix guaranteed to fail.

“Like” is inactive and tepid. 

“I like her” is half-hearted and unexciting.

“I hate him.” Now THAT comes with a lot of passion, storm and frenzy.

We like people enough not bother about them.
But we hate people enough to follow their every move, psycho-analyse their motives and intentions, hoping for disaster to occur.

Disaster hardly will occur (because haters don’t have magic wands), but followership is certain.

This “followership”, born out of so much feverish hatred, is what will ignite the way for You- the “hatee” to succeed.

I’ve said this many times, I don’t want to be liked. I have NEVER gotten anything from being Liked. It means absolutely nothing to me.

If "Like" was a song it’ll be at the bottom of The Billboard Chart. 

"Like" is indifferent, and the opposite of every good thing in life is Indifference.

Strive for love (and as we know, love will remain elusive- this mysterious shithead). 

You’ll most likely not get love because love is a slave driver, and we are not built to be slaves. 

But you can get hate. Not because you desire it, but you refuse to compromise your persona to end up at the bottom of the chart, where "Like" resides. 

Anything that lights a fire is good enough. Hate lights enough fire to burn the bushes for you to walk through OR illuminate your path to success.

But please, be an intelligent "hatee"...

I know I’m not making any sense.

I have not had breakfast.
