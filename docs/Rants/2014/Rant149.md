August 4, 2014

We did it in plastic bags in the bathroom and kept it by the corner…

By 4.30am we stroll with the polybags to the dumpster at the end of the street. 

We pay N20 then we are allowed to fling the bags over the barbwire.

From Eruwa (OND), to Ibadan (HND), to Ajaawa, Ogbomosho (NYSC)…

I have been left traumatised by the poop experience.

It got distressing to a point where a friend once nudged me:

“Joy, X is asking you out. Just say yes! He lives in Bodija. We can always go there to shit.”

Contemplating dating a guy because you cannot carry your Lagos toilet on your head to these bloody bucolic settings (places that have no business being bucolic, by the way) is the most ridiculous thing I almost did.
