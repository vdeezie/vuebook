I just spoke to a billionaire's assistant regarding a project her boss said I should work on.

All I wanted was an address to a location.

She was very rude.

Very rude.

"Listen I am not in the office... I don't know the address... why don't you ask somebody in the main office..." she yapped

"You seem irritated, is it a wrong time? Should I call back?" I asked.

"What do you meeeeeean? How can you tell me I am irritateeeeed? Why would you say thaaaat?!!"

Small power, and Nigerians go raving MAD. 

I was amused, clearly.

I put her on speaker in the office, so Roberta and Tosin can hear her screams.

They left their mouths open.

When she was done screaming, I ended the call.

I've met her before. A young girl.

"Oh my God! Is she drunk from the weekend? Why is she so rude?" Roberta gasped.

"Why was she screaming like that though?" Tosin wondered.

"Wow! If I try that with any of Ms. Joy's contacts, I'm dead. I will just go and dig my grave!" Roberta said.

We all laughed. 

But it's true.

Roberta wouldn't dare!
.

I'm supposed to be working on a project with this brat.

I swear, I'll push her down the railings before the end of that project.

So... I will not be taking the project if they insist I work with her. No!

-Because... Murder she wrote.

Would you?
