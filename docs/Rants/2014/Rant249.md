The argument: “It is illegal to build an extra three-storey on top of an existing bungalow…”

The Nigerian: “Just be happy that the man is succeeding. The fact that he can add three-storeys more is a sign of God’s blessings. Don’t be jealous. Pray that God gives you your own, or are you a hater?”

The argument: “I will sue all the association of Alaba boys for pirating my movie. This is unethical!”

The Nigerian: “Why not just thank God that someone is pirating your work. Why not thank God that you are the original brain. Why do you keep going on and on like a hater? Please move on, forget the past and you will see favour. Your anger is a hindrance to your blessing; that is why you still live in a rented apartment.”

The argument: “I need to get my socks from my Ex’s house.”

The Nigerian: “Haba! You still haven’t forgotten about her? With all the women in town? Don’t be a stalker. Get a life.”

PS: God must have been really tired (probably after a "Saturday Nite" gig with Angel Michael and co)  when he formed the most important part of the Nigerian.
