Everyone reaches a breaking point.

I reached mine a while back

I am not an optimistic Nigerian

I am more useful being pissed.

At least I will not have to suck in faeces from a pipe like straw in a Fanta bottle

My forthrightness is all that I have left

It is what keeps me awake

It is what covers me when I sleep 

Because I have long realised this country is full of shit

If your are going to be rich in Nigeria, you will reek of crisp naira notes running into billions of naira 

There’s no decency to it

You get it and get drunk by it

And if you are going to be poor, you’ll be rolling in abject lack, a disgraceful state that feasts on common sense.

As I hear, we have the highest number of jet owners in the world.

All that money…

Yet the biggest supermarket chain in the country is owned by South Africans, the biggest chain of fast-food owned by Indians, the ONLY well-recognized cable channel is owned by South Africans.

All that money, all that sense of accomplishment, yet very little is pumped back into the system

What do rich Nigerians do with their wealth?

They organise seminars where they tell you how to make invisible money and how to be obedient and loving citizens of the country. All the stuff that sounds good on paper. They gather their ilk, get celebrities to sing for them and then flaunt what they have so you can drool and bath in your saliva. They want you to see what you can never be. And YOU, will sit down for hours watching people fart all over you; clapping like toads to their sleek empty highly impracticable words.

Nigerians will sit quiet, hours of long talk and go home emptier than they came. Not one piece of information from the gathering of “whatevers” to enrich you.

When they are not organising those type events, they are dating American Reality stars.

Ghetto fabulous African Americans with a brain the size of agbalumo seeds and enhanced boobs.

When they are not moaning from American sex, they are sponsoring DMX and Keyshia Cole to come sing at a party with half-naked Nigerian women and wanna-be millionaire men. 

That is it.

Don’t forget that some of these people are oil-well billionaires; a stroke of luck, the right contact, the right meeting, no credits to hard work or smart enterprise, just Oil…

That is why they have no clue what to do with money.

If you are still sitting down at dead conferences and clapping your hands when you should fling a microphone at the organisers for even daring to think of you in the way they think of plastic mannequins, then you are half the problem of this mess we are in.

You should be angry. A Nigerian without anger is a suspicious thing to watch. He either has no sense, or his senses have been bought.
