LOL!

There’s a post on Richard Ali’s wall: 

“Passing by Christian students ‘speaking in tongues’ at the #UIbadan, I'm amazed--these clowns actually think they're making a difference!”

And then a Christian Brother arrives: “May I humbly request that you pull this blasphemy down.”

Richard Ali responds: "No, you may not request that.”

Christian Brother: “Richard Ali, what you posted is blasphemy against the holy spirit. It constitutes very serious attack on my faith. Please pull it down.”

You see why I have to leave social media? This is not life at all.

How do you go to a man’s house and tell him to remove the mistletoe hanging on his door because it offends you. 

Who are you?

Shouldn’t you just go on about your business? Or at least make a valid argument why you think the mistletoe should be flushed down the toilet than be hung?

We are too old for these things, too “poor” as a people to be fixated to a point of angst on the next person's opinion. This is a third world country and we need everybody’s brain working. We can’t focus on religion or physical “beauty” for too long; for the simple fact that lack of faith and oyinbo flat ass continue to create the world we dream of and grovel for, like crumbs on the floor, our toned bodies and big butt achieving nothing but endless arguments and sizing of words, popping collar on cyber space. So much for all your faith and endowments.

Christians, when your world is falling apart and you are locked up in a room speaking an unknown language (sometimes committing spiritual incest and all the debauchery you let slip through the sheets of your Bible), you do look clownish.

Yes, you do. Now get over it.

I do all that speaking in my room, alone :)
