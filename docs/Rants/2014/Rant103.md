# Rant103

I met her again- the acquaintance I talk about every other month, the one who worked at MTN, Virgin so-and-so before getting married and becoming this apparition.

I took my girls to a fast food joint for a quick after-school snack; she was standing at the corner, beside an oversized umbrella buying credit voucher.

Our eyes met and she came to where I parked.

She wanted me to buy her the special bitter-leaf soup at the joint

This woman- dishevelled, disturbed and defeated, with a wry smile; I could feel her pain seeping out of her pores. She would not look into my eyes for fear that she might find a mocking glare.

I did not have a mocking stare.

I would not wear a mocking stare.

Not for a woman who cannot find her way back to happiness; locked out of paradise.

“I have to care for 3 young children now…” her complaints always rushing out of her mouth like a leaking pipe.

I may not be able to tolerate her constant nags every time we meet (because…really, why are you still in a marriage that makes you look like this?!)

But this time, something happened- to me. 

I got into my car and cried quietly- for this young woman who gave everything in exchange for nothing.  

I have decided to do something- take her out to a fancy restaurant, have lunch together, listen to her rant and rant and rant and rant about her life until I turn blue…then to the movies- something funny to cheer her up, buy her a nice blouse and a small gift for her kids.

This is what my heart wants to give.

I refuse to toss her a few thousand bucks, that would be disrespectful in my opinion and would not automatically save her from her situation. She needs an experience- something to remind her of a life she can get back (if she's willing to try).

I think y’all deserved to know, since comments from the post was very heated and contentious. It took me this long to get to this conclusion; I strongly believe we do not have to act when others think we should. 

Until I could genuinely feel her pain, I wasn’t going to let anything or anyone or society’s exaggerations bully me into action.

There are many women out there living a quarter of the life they were meant to have with no one to slap them back to their senses. Do not let their troubles overwhelm you…but if you can, reach out. It could just be a kind word in due season…or even tough love.
