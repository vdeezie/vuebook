# Rant296


December 2, 2014

I was invited to the recording of a Lifestyle show last week, when the amiable producer saw me, we hugged and cackled and she said,

“Ehen! So this is you, abi? This is the Joy. This is all of you, abi you left some of you at home? Your larger-than-life persona is in this cute body and smile and warmth. How do you manage to be all of that enigma on Facebook?”

Heehee!

Another meeting, at Access Bank Women Entrepreneurship Day, when I finished my session, a lady came and her concerns were similar.

“So this is You? Your voice should be raspy and loud, but it is this tiny, cheery, happy sound. I was expecting someone twice your size. Look at you- with those dimples.”

And she pulled my cheek. LOL!

Like I tell everyone, my alter ego saved me. 

Facebook is my “Sasha fierce” in all its complications and chaos.

I had to find an outlet for the raving demons roaring inside; it was going to choke me. 

Things I couldn’t share with “real people”, I could pour right on a virtual platform and watch people react however they wish; I could start a trending topic and watch how it is dissected; I let virtual people figure out what to make of my thoughts without getting any burns. Their decisions will not be my concern. The responsibility is not mine anymore. Phew!!! 

And with all my rants, terminating friendships, gaining new ones, making virtual foes, building a fan base…I won’t trade this Facebook experience for anything.

This is my therapy.

Imagine if all of the rants, all 290+ rants were never expressed. Imagine how miserable I would be carrying them around, weighed down by thoughts and monsters that need to break free.

I would need deliverance.

I draw purpose and strength from my alter ego. 

I wish I am half as strong as my “Sasha”. Half as courageous, unflinching.

Really, I am just a publicist using what I have to build what I want.

I come here to draw strength to face the real world.

Nothing I have done in the last year would have been possible if I wasn’t here on Facebook.

They would remain in my head, afraid to find expression.

There’s something about Facebook (and I am very particular about Facebook, Twitter is a joke), it filters your life. If you know why you are really here, you will find the people you need to meet. 

Friendships are built and destroyed with the click of a button. In real life, you spend years trying to get out of the wrong company, on Facebook that decision, with the help of all the necessary buttons and actions and rants composed from the comfort of your bed, is made as fast as a car smashing a chicken to its death. 

Zuckerberg should be paying me for all this PR.
