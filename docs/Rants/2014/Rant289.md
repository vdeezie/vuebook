Bill Cosby... tsk tsk tsk

If only the old man did not bequeath himself the task of scolding African Americans from his rocking chair, he would have died with all his (alleged) sins.

But he had to talk. He had to wield his cane, hit on bare black backs and spread his opinion around the bloc one too many times of his thoughts on how African Americans should live- like the perfect picture of the Huxtables'.

*sigh*

But then came Hannibal Burress, his nemesis; shows up and spoils the old man's fun. This comedian reminded the world of this man with a record of alleged rape cases wrapped around his crotch for over a decade.

If there is truth in the stories of over 20 women, then Cosby lived the perfect double life. Hypocrisy, as we know, in measured proportion: 

Like the celebrity who castigates “runs girls” and forgets that these girls do not sleep with chairs and cows, they sleep with men (most times his colleagues. Or how are we blessed with “baby mamas” on this side of the universe? Do the women fuck the locked gates to men’s houses? These are men who want to let go of some cash and some gifts and some sperm; these men are just as guilty as any girl who turns her years of higher learning to steamy hot sessions; rendezvous with men able to make them feel like a Kardashian. If there is no patronage, there’ll be no trade.

Let’s take a minute to examine this: some of these “runs girls” end up kicking the wives out of matrimony and take over quite conveniently. They get the ring and get the life. Then they become “acceptable”. And some of them will start their own tirade of “husband snatchers” on social media.

Hypocrites, all of us.

Do we not know of pastors screwing every vagina within sight yet run successful churches? Preaching passionately about adultery?!

And politics- have we not heard of corrupt practices from every type of business run by regular Nigerians, yet we all throw stones at politicians, only because their figures are alarming?

We are hypocrites.

Social media is the bane of all stupidities. And Bill Cosby (something about Bills and power and semen) just had to get his hands into that hole and allow judgment day come before his grand meeting with God.
