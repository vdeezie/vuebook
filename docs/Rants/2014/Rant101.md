If you give up your happiness for your children, you may become resentful in future.

For all the dates you'd miss, all the parties you could have had, the degrees you would have pursued, places you should have visited…for all the friendships you couldn’t nurture…

Your children will grow and find their own joys, their own lovers…

And you will be alone

Even though they would have preoccupied your prime, they still will blame you for not “getting a life”- your own, and stop bothering with theirs.

It is tough- what you give up only to watch the thoughtless, almost uncharitable mannerisms of your children as they leap into life's pleasures, leaving you behind.

And if you try to jealously guard their love from anyone else, the world will judge you a bitter one.

Children were never meant for fulfillment. It is only a responsibility that must be carried out with love

You are not to give up life’s colour, dreams and opportunities just to watch your kids wear their shoes the right way.

Mothers, do get a life.

This is to my mum for giving it all up. 

Now she tells me, "you are entitled to your own little selfish pleasures, no child should take that away from you."

I want to pluck a star from the sky and attach to her hair.

My mother, my hero.

(Heroine sounds, well, facile; Hero it is for my mother).

Thank you for being a great grandma to my kids...and for giving it all up again and again.
