We need blunt people in our lives.

Not haters (whatever that means), but people who tell us the truth.

I hate pretence. God! I hate affectation measured in healthy doses doomed to sedate or kill.

If you love, say it.

If you don’t, say it.

But don’t lie. 

And don’t be indifferent. You are a living being, you shouldn’t be indifferent about judgments or feelings. You must stand for something. 

Then stand. 

And that is why I respect people who un-friend me on social media.

You have to be made-of-more to live in my world, so I respect that you can’t find a place here.

I have blocked a whole community of people. I have over 300 blocked names- more than some people’s entire friend total.

But this is not about friends and the ruse of social media.

This is about applying yourself to reason.

In the last weeks, I have interviewed writers. 

Some I told clearly: “You are not a writer.” They were upset of course, but I am not your mother or your lover; those ones who owe you affection, get to hold you and kiss your forehead and promise you forever.

I do not owe you flattery or any type of fawning adulation.

Let us be careful when truth comes and we are quick to shrug it off as careless retorts. 

“This is bad writing,” I said to another.

And I added in good effect, “In a few years’ to come, you improve, you win some big award and you can share the story of how Joy looked at you and said your work is poor. Then you can tell me to go to hell.”

It wouldn’t matter to me. As I remain impassively loyal or unemotionally responsible to you.

Some would go on twitter (is that not where they all try to find some importance to their ordinary lives?), and dedicate 10 series of tweets to “this woman who tried to kill my spirit”.

Of course it didn’t happen in this case, but it can. There is nothing I have not seen.

That is the stuff we are made of- in that warped rationality. Our ego comes first, wrecks our common sense and leaves us dazed as we watch events overtake us.

Because we count everything to be an affront and an offence

I still get whipped by my own “mentors”; and I am nothing fantastic… so there. We are all in the same ship. We all are "learners".

This is how you distinguish hate from bluntness:

If I run a business and I need business (because I am in business to get business and make money) and you walk through my door and I turn down your offer, that cannot be hate. There must be something about your offer (product or service) that does not align with my values or criteria.

Hate is when I have a book published, sell 3,500 copies in one month and some twitter fool says: “I don’t even like that Joy. I have heard things about her.”

Like what?

Like…she is proud…and she is not a good person.

And YOU are the biggest fool that ever liveth.

End of story.

That is hate- baseless.

If we pile up every issue that isn't supple enough to caress our ego at the door of hate, we will grow at a snail pace or not at all.

As long as we have breath, we still have a long way to grow.

Rid yourself of your ego and needless emotions and understand why you have been denied what you think you deserve.

PS: I hope, for your sake, you do not bask in fawning comments for too long that they shield you from lessons to be learnt.
