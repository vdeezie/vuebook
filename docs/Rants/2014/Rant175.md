I wasn’t a very confident teenager but I was good in English in high school. I worked really hard on my academics because I believed I was average and I needed that extra industry to make my presence and my scores in school outstanding.

It was my constant As in English that drew my English teacher towards me.

We became very close, and after school hours he’d summon me and we’d spend another hour or two at his desk chatting. He would bring some food, drinks to share with me.

He was very encouraging; of course way older than me, he was like a guardian and played the role quite well... even gave me money when I needed to refill my cupboard with grocery, or when my Dad missed visiting days (which wasn't very often. Dad is a good man).

We had many debating events that took us out of school (it was a boarding school) to town. My school was respected as we had an impressive track record.

One day he called me and said he had something to tell me…

He was going to get married to the Igbo teacher

I was disappointed.

I was disappointed and devastated; she was an ugly woman.

By God, she was ugly! Or at least that was what my 15 year old brain could surmise- big bulgy scary eyes, fat black lips, croaky voice like a frog’s, bad dress sense…

What did my adorable English teacher see in her?!

He deserves better; but what did I know… this love of a som’tin sef. LOL!

What he didn’t tell me was that she was already pregnant, and in a few months she was rolling around the school with a fat belly and sunshine at the tip of her nose.

He got busy putting his life together, and our regular rice-and-sprite hang out faded.

When we went to a debating competition some months later, I noticed everyone was acting strange in the bus… I thought maybe my uniform was too tight...or something embarrassing. I even checked to see if I was bleeding.

We won the competition, took the trophy and our individual prizes… and journeyed back to school.

Every student I met in the hallway was taking her eyes away… what is happening?

Until one Senior said, “Ah Joy Congrats!”

“What?”

“You are library prefect, congrats!”

And so I ran back, looking for my English teacher. He knew and had told everyone in the bus not to tell me until I got to school.

I didn't meet him in his office (and I never went to the teachers’ quarters). I went back to my room, into the embrace of well-wishers.

The next day, he gave me a congratulatory card with words written to express how proud he was of me.

When we had our last Social club event, the prom-like event that paired male and female students … he called me to his car and gave me a pack of Digestive biscuit and a card, we walked to the school kitchen, the women were busy baking and cooking, he leaned on the wall, his eyes self-doubting lacking the confidence they always had. And he asked me out:

“Can I take you to the beach during the holidays?”

I was 17, and that was the first time a boy/man would ask me out.

“No,” I answered

“Why not?”

“I won't be able to think up an excuse when I get home.”

It was an innocent gesture, I believed.

He was a good man, and I liked him very much.

I remember him now and then

He is the only academic figure that made any difference to my life.
