# Rant298


December 8, 2014

I was a little ambitious when I thought of 50 performances, so I think the best way to start this post is to apologise to those who didn’t get the chance to share their literature on stage. Some came all the way from Abuja.

We squeezed everybody into three hours and still had spill over enough to run another concert.

I do hope you enjoyed the event, regardless.

Ah! I still can’t find the words to describe how I feel. 

This one time, I am tongue-tied and just full of gratitude. 

Thank you. Thank you.

Toni Kan and his naughty poem. I love you plenty, Oga. LOL!

The amazing Tade Ipadeola gave me a special poem in a bottle that would be worth millions of naira in a few years to come. That’s my NLNG prize heating up. 

Wana Udobang’s “this Love is not for sale” was soothing. Everything about her radiates peace.

Aduke with her guitar makes everything perfect.

Crown Troupe of Africa and the indefatigable Segun Adefila continue to blow my mind.

Efe Paul…ah! What?! No words to describe the magic of his verses.

Dami Ajayi’s poetry is the air you breathe!

Everyone owned the stage. 

Everyone.

The performances were on point! 

Oris, I pulled him out of his comfort zone and he didn’t disappoint.

Yvonne, Agbons, Bukola. I love. I love. I love.

This is a poor excuse for a “Thank you” post. 

The rest of what I feel cannot be put into words.

Jite, for that lovely review, thank you.

Pelu Awofeso, my relentless supporter, thank you.

Everyone. Bless.

Pictures will be up soon.

Let me return to my little happy corner
