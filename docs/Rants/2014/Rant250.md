Every responsible parent knows…

There’s an amazing rush of pride and gratitude that burst through every pore and form a pond by your side after you pay that thick sum of money for a new school session.

You feel this way because you know you run an effective country all by yourself.

When it comes to kids and education, there are no compromises… I do the sprint and then the marathon.

Because of the crazy sum I pay for primary education, I don’t suffer fools with any type character from that school.

They KNOW.

Like a year ago, some teacher was rude to me. I came at her spitting fire and brimstone, setting her weave in flames…figuratively.

“You see all these potbellied fathers here? Driving their SUVs? Looking like overfed cows? You see them? Making loud calls, rolling around, wives licking their feet…and YOU fretting, helping them with their door, pulling their children’s cheeks a hundred times, bending your knee with that ridiculous smile on your face…

I PAY exactly the same fucking fees as they do! In fact I pay double- with two kids…
I ensure you get your salary at the end of the month, mudafucka! So the next time you disrespect me, like you just did, I’ll spit in your face.”

By this time the apologies were rolling out like Bible verses.

“Just remember,” I added, “Unless my money is of less value, when you see me- think of those potbellied heroes of yours. That is who I am. Only difference is that I’m female, pretty, un-potbellied and desirable.”

That day I ran out of fucks.

Since then, no trouble.
