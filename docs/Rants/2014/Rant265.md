My Top 6 events of the day…

The Mayor of (enriching) literature, Toni Kan, has cleared his schedule for Saturday to accommodate “The Business of Writing”. Only me one? I am grateful, sir.

My super-crush actor, Demola Adedoyin, called to wish me well as I sit atop a pile of last-minute work for Saturday’s event. Always a charmer, thanks.

I have been able to work out the venue and I am told it can accommodate 70 people. So yes, 20 more people get codes for the event. Yay!

Another wonderful person committed cash to “The Business of Writing” event. Thank you. Thank you.

I went shopping and I bought a nice tee shirt; so soft, it feels like good sex.

Again, I return home after the day’s hustle to meet yet another lovely inbox message:

“Hello JIB, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate what you do. Each time I visit your wall, I feel empowered as your rants are therapeutic.

These messages I share...it's like fondling your own breasts (I know. I know)

I love them. 

Spread love, not hate :D
