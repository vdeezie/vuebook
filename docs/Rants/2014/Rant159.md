Just a minute ago... minding my own business in my study when my ears plucked the conversation my children were having in the sitting room…

Ife: I want to go and ask mummy something

Jolade: What is it?

Ife: I want to ask her the meaning of “abreast”

Jolade: You don’t know?

Ife: Well, I have an idea…I think it has to do with being informed.

Jolade: No nah. That is not the meaning.

Ife: Let me go and confirm.

Jolade: Wait, I know the meaning…

Ife: Really? What is it then?

Jolade: Abreast is a disease of the breast.

I laughed so hard the oats I was eating came out from my nose.
