# Rant144

I remember when “Ashewo” used to rile women up.

When I was young, I would enter a bus to get to the next street and I’d hear a messy conductor call one of his passengers, “Ashewo”…and she’d be mad. She'd let the hurt sink into her vagina and then piss all over his face with words from the belly of hell.

And I wondered, “Why is she so mad? How does a conductor make a woman in red lipstick and a nice corporate shirt mad? He is nothing. What does it matter what nothing has to say?”

I was barely 14 and I held such thoughts.

When I escort an aunt to Tejuosho market, men with okrika wares and low-grade intellect would pull her hands, some would pinch her buttocks, brush her nipple, all degrading sorts…

She would get weary after 30 minutes, buy nothing and drag me back home.

And I would wonder: “Why? Why would she let them get away with this? Why should we come all the way to the market and leave with nothing just because men believe she shouldn’t walk through the aisle of a flood of a particular gender without being harassed.”

I was 15 and I was at the bus-stop waiting for a bus to take me to the next street. A group of retarded boys stopped their car in front of me, then one said: 

“Shit, you'z a fine girl. You got anything for papa?” and he smacked his lips, caressed his groin for a second and then drove off. 

I knew that shit can not fry one strand of her on my head. Toh!

Why should a teenage girl feel sorry for wearing a pretty dress at the bus-stop with some lip gloss on, waiting for a bus? Ta! I flipped my hair and didn't give a rat ass.

I was 12 when my mother took me to Eko Meridein Hotel for lunch one fine Sunday afternoon. When we got there, some hot Hausa dude came to our table and asked if he could buy us lunch. Obviously he was interested in my mum, she was barely 38 years old then.

Mum said “No”.

I was sipping on my drink, enjoying the view, admiring white people laugh under the African sun, with bikinis, taking a swim at the poolside.

We left too early. I wasn’t happy. And we never went back again.

And so I asked her: “Why? Why have you stopped going out? Why did you cut our Eko Meridien enjoyment? Why?”

She said, “A young woman and a girl child at places like that…people could mistake me for a loose woman- a prostitute.”

*sighs*

With that, my mother stayed indoors forever. She never went out- ever!

And so I ask: 

Why? Why the fuck should I care what society thinks? 

Why should I care what men think? 

Why in hell should I care what women have to say? 

Why should your opinion matter to me?” 

Why Why Why? I have been asking this question since I was 13!

How do you give someone/anyone that much control over your life?

My mum has finally embraced this stance. But she lost many years- many years she should have basked in the sun; she gave it all up because society had an opinion and she allowed her ears to listen.!

PS: as a publicist I can assure you that your hate rant will not go to waste, ask that ugly blogger. I will most likely make money on top of your head.
