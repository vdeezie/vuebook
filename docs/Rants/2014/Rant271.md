I got a message on FB a while back. Let’s call her Bimz

Bimz: Hello Joy. I just want to ask for your forgiveness. What I did was wrong. Or was it you? I stole your husband in secondary school…but I think it was actually you who came between us. Whatever it was, I just want to ask that you forgive me. Because God has forgiving us all.

I try to recall- Bimz…Bimz…Bimz. I can’t tell her face from a blank sheet of paper. I don’t know this woman, but she claims she stole/I stole a husband…in secondary school…when I was a teenager! (I wasn't even dating anyone in high school!)

Joy: Sorry Bimz, I don’t know what you are talking about. Are you saying I was married in secondary school?

Bimz: These things are not of the eyes, and I did not mean to take him back from you.

Joy: So who is this husband we stole from each other? Does he have a name?

Bimz: It is of the past, Joy. I only sent you a message of forgiveness. I forgive you, as you must forgive me too.

So I holler at a high school classmate…let’s call her Clara.

Joy: Babes, there’s this Bimz in my inbox…claiming all sorts. What do you know about her mental health?

Clara: Hi Joy. Bimz is ok. She's doing well. Had a slight breakdown at some point, mental issues; but she's great now. What's up?

Hmmmm!

I holler at another classmate. Let’s call him Kunle.

Kunle: Joy, unfriend the girl. She’s a psycho; been buzzing me and telling me I am the love of her life, stalking me all around London. 

Ok. 

Unfriend ke! I press the block button! So now we are all safe. 

Perhaps.
