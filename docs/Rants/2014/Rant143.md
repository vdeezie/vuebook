I don’t think we should worry about Nicki Minaj flaunting her booty on the cover of her album or continuously question why hip-hop promotes misogyny. These are personal choices.

These video vixens, they love what they do. They love it better than a lot of us love our “decent” jobs in banking, engineering, writing and corporate businesses.

It is silly to instruct an adult on what they should do with their career because you have a, say, 14 year old daughter who watches him/her. Why is she watching him/her?

Hip-hop is what it is. Rihanna is rude and naked. Lady Gaga took off her clothes to get attention at the pub she used to perform before the men and their whiskey bottles could pay attention, Chris Brown is hot-headed, Floyd Mayweather is a foolish spender; Beyoncé, regardless of her star power and influence is still singing songs like “partition”…

This is what it has become and will remain so for a very long time.

I find it ridiculous that we think we are in a position to direct or educate celebrities on how they should portray themselves. Every Tom and Dick has one advice, or two, for famous personalities.

What we should worry about is the sexual crime and debauchery, moral decadence eating institutions like schools and churches. 

Let strippers strip to their g-strings at clubs, let them take off their bras and jiggle what-they-got to their customers; let entertainers bleach their skin blue and walk around with only nipple-casings…your kid has no business being mentored or influenced by them anyway; and if they do, then it’s your fault Mr/Mrs Parent.

You may want to teach them discipline to go with their young curiosity. 

My kids know all about Rihanna, because I cannot hide them under a rock and pretend she does not exist or that I do not like her music. I have explained it severally that she’s a good musician with serious personal issues…(don’t we all have our issues?)

Another thing, don’t be too quick to change the channel when adults share a kiss in a movie. If your kids/wards catch sight of it, don’t pretend it didn’t happen. Just explain it to them.

“That was a kiss by the way- right on the lips. Yes, it’s an adult thing. I do kiss you on your cheek, don't I?"

-Because, really, they have friends in school with loose parental supervision who watch Telemundo! They get the 411 on all the things you think they are protected from right in their classrooms by “more exposed” classmates.

*gasps*

Leave entertainers alone, it is not in their jurisdiction to train your kids to become astronauts and presidents.

If you have to worry at all, let us worry collectively about pastors and spiritual/moral and academic authorities who take advantage of children’s naivety, and the trust given to them by parents.

The so-called virtuous institutions that ask for our trust, as parents, chronicle some of the most depraved acts on children.
