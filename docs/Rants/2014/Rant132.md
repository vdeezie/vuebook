Dear Pastors,

Tomorrow your financiers, sorry members, will be strolling into church to listen to yet another sermon.

It is important that you exhibit some level of intelligence.

Ebola is here; it is wild, vicious and quick to destruction.

No, it will not pass over you and your favourite members. 

Like God, it shows no favouritism.

I will be by my window working on my laptop as usual, your raucous prayers will hit my shield and force their way in…I beg you, do not carry on with your typical raspy, guttural noise-making; do not make damning requests…

“May Ebola kill all your enemies!”

“May it penetrate the walls of your neighbours and finish them, but may it not come near you.”

“Ebola will not find you, it will cross over to the other house.”

“I decree that Ebola will finish all your adversaries…”

“Ebola is sent to destroy only your oppressors. Be cheerful it will not get to you in Jesus’ name…”

“Let us lay a special offering for Ebola prayer, to ensure the angels guard our front doors and kick the virus away from our household…”

*sighs*

If you have to pray, pray that the virus does not ravage whatever is left of this sorry nation... of all West Africa.

Pray for total healing in the land. 

Pray for restoration; pray for mankind.

I beg you, for once, do it right.

Shame your cousins- politicians and whoremongers.

Bless you.
