Letter to the son (I will never have)…

I will make this very short because you are a man and you need to get back to working and making money...

Do not hit a woman.

Do not abandon your children.

Do not hit a woman.

Do not tie your common sense to religion, which inevitably means your seeds will suffer the consequences of an idiotic father.

Do not hit a woman.

Pay your debts.

Have some dignity- that translates to working for your own money. Do not become some boy toy. If you have to go down on a vagina, go down because you like the vagina…not for some reward, like a contract or a nice Armani suit. 

Do not hit a woman.

Enjoy being a human being- love and do not be ashamed of it. Laugh and smile as bright as the morning sun. Cry if you must, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. And do not be embarrassed to admit the fear or shame that creeps into your heart sometimes- maybe of a past or of the future.
 
Find a good woman, whatever that means.

God is amazing; nothing like they portray Him to be. Please stay away from churches and protect your own children from the wiles of religion…just like I protected you. Read your Bible for yourself.

Oh! And another important one I have yet to mention…

Do not hit a woman.

That would be all.

PS: I need new shoes, my son. Please do the needful. You have my bank details.
