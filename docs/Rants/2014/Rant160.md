If I was Dele Momodu, I would start this post by saying:

“Stephanie Okereke Linus called me yesterday from Los Angeles and we spent over an hour talking about life and love, friendships and disappointments, careers and dreams...

She shared her short and long term career goals with me, personal stories of triumph, intriguing inspirational experiences to help me get out of the mood I was in… 

She asked about my immediate goals and how she can fund some of them…talked about things we can do together; said I write so good I should have my own media platform to do whatever I want.

The phone would go off, and she’d call back. 

We laughed and she made me cry- the truths she shared, the strength she gave me; her genuine love and spirit. The hope, just hearing her say: ‘don’t worry, everything will work out just fine...

She’s like a best friend, this Stephanie! She understands. By God, she understands! And she always tries to make things better. There are no feigned modesties, just compassion- tangible and sincere.

This morning, the buzz of a new email woke me up. She had sent a youtube sermon by Archbishop Nicolas Duncan Williams… with a short prayer.”

But I’m not Dele Momodu, so I’ll just say: 

“I got a call from Stephanie yesterday.”
