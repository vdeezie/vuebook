I have seen beautiful things-

The GENUINE laughter of a child raised by the side of the road with nothing but a pant, unfit to clean a toilet bowl, wrapped around his waist, by a mother raped every night to breed bastards for lack of shelter or lack of ambition… (not her situation but the laughter of the child that I find beautiful)

I have seen a smile across the room that solved problems therapy could not reach…

I have seen second chances offered as toppings on a cake…

I have seen October 1- the movie.

If I can stop breathing so hard, I may be able to write a review later.

But for now, I just want to crawl into bed and hold tight to the experience. 

Whatever it is you may have heard of Kunle Afolayan…I do not know the man personally, but I have seen his works (Figurine, Phone Swap, October 1)…

And, by God, they are like water to a dying child in a desert.

October 1 being the oasis.

This post, however, addresses something different. It visits a practice amongst Nigerian cinema goers.

You may not truly comprehend our lack of “fitting emotion” until you sit in the theatre with tons of other Nigerians watching a Nigerian movie…

We laugh.

That’s all the emotion we have.

Laughter.

Then there’s anger. (Misplaced anger- at the child who gets a beating of his life for eating an orange from the basket without permission.)

Our laughter, however, is the most unsettling of the two emotions.

The Nigerian movie-watcher laughs when a man confesses, years later- stripped of a conscience, that he was raped by a priest in school for 5 months.

It is a “laughing matter”.

The Nigerian movie-watcher laughs when a man becomes a monster, raping and killing women, because of a childhood that was stolen from him by an older man who found his anus a fucking nice hole to explore.

It is funny. 

They laugh because, really, the Nigerian is not taught, in too many ways, how to express "appropriate feelings".

It shows even in our relationships.

We have been taught: “do not show a man you love him, he will drag your love on the floor and slap it on a wall like a grotesque painting for all to see.”

We tell the man: “do not express how you feel, she will take advantage of it and will not see you as a man anymore.”

We grew up with parents who argued and splashed anger all over the living room; and then, who settled and laughed over a rather unfunny Nigerian sitcom later with garden eggs and peanut butter.

Any other emotion will find the Nigerian uncomfortable, unsure, rebellious.

So we are going to be laughing in the cinema when boys are raped by catholic priests for 6 years, and left damaged and torn…

We will laugh because we do not know how else to convey our feelings- to articulate our pain, shock and grief appropriately.  

No doubt, there are VERY FUNNY parts of the movie; but the crux of October 1 is a sad, poignant and jerking tale and description of damage that cannot be repaired.

I’m sorry, but the bulk of movie-watchers missed it.

They miss it like they miss the genuineness of everything they let go of.

PS: Kunle Afolayan was there to meet the fans after the movie (a full hall, I must add). I wanted to ask for a handshake, but I was sure I was going to cry. I wouldn't be able to EXPRESS exactly how I felt because I am Nigerian, and I am expected to just laugh and take a picture.
