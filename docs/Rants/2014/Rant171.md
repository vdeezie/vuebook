Naked women in videos...

Gold chain-wearing saved-by-auto-tune musicians...

Actors with only the ability to scream into the screen...

Miserly educated OAPs and journalists...

Hustlers and racketeers...

All have a higher chance of success in Nigeria than doctors, lawyers, scientists, astronauts- dedicated professionals who spend years studying.

How anybody can yet tell me they love this country still amazes me

You are an orphan, dear Nigerian

A sad orphan eating from the bin 

How in God’s name does Jonathan terminate residency training programme for doctors? Who are his sick advisors?  

You seek education in Nigeria, you get shit. Polytechnic students were roosting at home for 9 months with half-baked educated asses; half of which are unable to express their thoughts in proper comprehensible English… 

With half-baked education all over the country, we are yet plagued with crises, demands and strikes.

You manage to wing through it all- for professionals like doctors, almost a decade of studying just to be told in clear non-verbal cues that…

It would have been better if you had aspired to become a video vixen or, in clearer terms, a porn star- male or female.

That is what they tell us when they make such idiotic decisions!

What a country!
