Black people have black problems.

One of it would be the need to show off wealth offensively or irrationally

Even when they don’t have it, like Waconzy, they still show off! Gather one dollar bills and shield it from embarrassment with a few $100 (see ehn, even if that story is not true, it remains the funniest shameless shit any entertainer can ever do).

The black man will pass off a Rolls Royce on Instagram as his, with a rider: “cruising with my bitch money. Notin’ hotter than diz paper yo!”

An hour later, the Car Rental would have to jump on instagram to thank the black man for enjoying the ride in THEIR Rolls Royce.

It is the black man that would take a picture of his obviously fake Rolex watch and send to blogs, with the caption: “Spotted! Agbaya rocking a $23k Rolex machine.”

Only for someone with a keen eye to bust his foolishness with accurate details of its amazing fakery.

It is still the black man that would drag his Caucasian girlfriend by the hair to announce on social media that he is dating a woman of a “better race”!!!

LOL!

The black man is not interested in real success, he is only attracted to the kind of success that would make every other black man look unsuccessful.

That is how we measure success. You have to be Down for me to be Up. 

You have to be sad for me to be happy.

You have to be the tail for me to be the head.

That is why the black community all over the world is usually the most tumultuous and the least progressive.

We can’t even stand ourselves. 

There’s no end to our foolery.

From America to Nigeria, black people live life with reckless abandon that would make any other race question our sanity.

Just look around you, look at the rich white man who marries a simple white woman, drives a simple blue car, owns a nice house and wears a tee shirt. Only details of opulence here and there to show he is of importance, but nothing that attacks and chews on decency.

There’s an answer to this type of post…

IS IT YOUR MONEY?

Agreed, it is not my money. It is yours. 

But if you have N150m naira and the matchbox in your house is made from Holland, the bottle of milk is imported from America, the pot is from Indonesia, the basmati rice is from Ireland, your cooker from Taiwan, couch from Italy, bed from Dubai, TV from Hong Kong… isn’t something wrong?

The black man with N150m is still poor. He buys a car, RENTS a house, travels to Dubai, gets a hot wife, and then starts to motivate young people on how to make money and tuck it under their beds.

The white man with a quarter of that amount would build platforms that will reproduce his kind ten thousand times.

But what does it matter; they call people like us haters.
