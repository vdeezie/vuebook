Relatives begin to gather, and between one and the next is a broad smile and a glimpse of generic understanding. There’s the exaggerated praise-and-worship, the repetitious hum of good wishes. A constellation of hallelujah for the birth of a child. 

Noise and quiet and drinks and prejudice for what God should do in the life of the new born- raise him/her above her peers and place him/her on top of the world.

We don’t even have the amenities to cater for one more individual in Nigeria. Private schools are cramped, public school is a joke, but childbirth happens still, everyday, like the routine it is meant to be without logic.

Institutions from health to security have broken down irreparably. There are cracks in the Nigerian foundation. How much more can it hold?

I love my kids, but if I knew then what I know now, I probably will not have kids. And I will not even cringe for saying it.

It makes no sense, the drudgery. We have to bring children up in second-class environment with nothing but idiotic TV programmes where I have caught people KISSING passionately several times- on family rated shows!!! But what other options are there? They draw, they paint, they read Enid Blyton like it is going out of fashion. Mum tries to retain her sanity by building mini-events around with friends and having meaningful sex just so she can pinch herself and remember she is still alive. She has not yet drifted into zombie status. 

There’s nothing out here for a new born. Nothing but plunder and wreck. Why are we still brining them into the world?

Where do we take our kids to? There’s nowhere to visit; I have to cough out at least a million to ensure I can take them to a country with, at least, a Disney-que experience. How does a middle-class mother make such money available for “enjoyment”; it goes straight to school fees and rents; with the constant desperate grind to live above poverty level. 

We went for a marathon cinema trip few weeks ago, back-to-back movies- Frozen, Peabody, Malificent, and the other one… in one day, trying to make up for this under-developed chaos of being born at all.

And when I get like this, I am reminded that I am of the “privileged” stock that can provide an above average life for my kids, and make good choices. Well I don’t feel privileged. Why do we have to compare apples and agbalumo? Why should I find comfort in knowing that my parental grouse is another parent’s testimony? I get stuck all the time. I worry because I do not know how to compromise with kids- they deserve the best. I give only the best. 

I drove past a dirt-poor (probably mentally deranged) woman breast-feeding her baby beside the road the other day… I get home to the news of a neighbour’s birth.

Such common exercise… shouldn’t we all just take a break?

We are, after all, allowed to draw in logic as human beings, seeing that we are not antelopes or giraffes that go with instinct: why do we still feel the need to have children when we have zero facilities to cater to their needs? 

There are no answers to anything- from the very complex to the outrageously simple.

"I noticed your daughter is always at home. No school?"

"Ah! No money, my sister. Her father says he will change their school."

"But she's been at home for close to a year."

"Yes, he is still working on it."

"And you are pregnant."

"Yes nah, e don reach make she get junior brother or sister heehee!"

I am at the cusp of slipping into delirium.
