Woman1: Hmmmph! Did you see that sugabelly's tweet?

Woman2: The one on body count? I was so ashamed.

Woman1: Chei! Useless girl. See de number of men she has slept with. Thirteen! At what age?

Woman2: She will never find a husband, mark my words.

Woman1: Who will marry her?

Woman2: The bible says sex should only happen in marriage. All these wayward girls…

Woman1: It is terrible, shameful. These are the kind of people that infuriate terrorists…

Woman2: Ehen?! 

Woman1: Yes nah. These are the women who create terrorism in the world. It is because of them that terrorists are bombing everywhere, they want to cleanse the world of all its sin.

Woman2: That is why we need to ensure our children follow the Lord.

Woman1: I like the piece Mayowa wrote

Woman2: The skinny girl with ugly legs, abi? Yes, yes, she is a woman of virtue. She talked extensively about the bible and the importance of chastity 

Woman1: She will find a husband and live a godly life, while sugabelly will stay single for ever.

Woman2: Hear the name sef, “sugabelly”…too much sugar in her belly. Jedi jedi pikin.

Woman1: I'll call you back, let me go and take care of “daddy” first; he just got back from work; at least I am married and I have a right to have sex under the covering of marriage.

Woman2: We thank God for virtuous women like us. Shame to useless women.

Woman1: Amen.

And after all is said and done... after Mayowa Ogundele’s super annoying worthy-to-have-your-head-slammed-into-a-rock poorly written shit rant…

It was a MAN, Ikemesit Effiong, who came to sugabelly’s defence.

A. Man!

Women remain the most hateful, judgmental, condescending being. The strong towers, the wind behind the tenets of patriarchy. The true enemies of emancipation.
