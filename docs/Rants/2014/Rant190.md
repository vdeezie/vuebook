I used to judge people by “appearance”.

If she can get her fashion right, then she must have some common sense

If she is in the choir, then she must have some values

If he writes such lovely literature on sex and romance, he must be a great lover

If he speaks so eloquently, he definitely cannot be a brute

If she runs an NGO, surely she has a heart for people

If he is a surgeon, then…dayuuum! He’s gonna be fabulous at many regular things

If he is so intelligent, he must know how to build his finances

If she is on TV, she can’t have BO or MO nah

If he has lived abroad, then he must be more liberal, enlightened, contemporary

Abi?

Fa fa faaaa... Fowl!

These days, everything is what it is... until it is not.

And I don’t even question, not anymore.

I have eased into that zone: 

"Any colour you show, na you get wahala; I’m colour blind."
