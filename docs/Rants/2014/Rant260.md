The plan was... 

“Go to Genevieve Pink Ball!”
“Ok.”
….
“Are you there yet?”
“Not yet.”

*One hour silence*
…
“Demola, how is it going over there?”

“Err…I’m not at Pink Ball oh. I was re-routed to Nollywood Movie Awards.”

LOL!

But I think the pink works either way.

That is Demola Adedoyin aka Prince Aderopo (October 1 movie actor) on the red carpet over the weekend.

So ladies, what do you think- Yay or Nay?
