The artiste targets a market…

Nollywood does not exist for itself… actors do not act for fellow actors, they act for a market to buy

Musicians do not sing for the sake of their colleagues, they sing and get patronage from the public

Comedians do not hold a trade that is (meant to be) patronised by their contemporaries, their craft is for everybody else to buy, to enjoy

Dancers perform for an audience

Painters, sketchers, cartoonists, sculptors look to an open market to sell their craft

Only Writers in Nigeria look to themselves for patronage

We write things only fellow writers can enjoy…

That is what intellectual snobbery does

It alienates you from reality

You are caught up in your own conceit, you fail to realise or admit to your threadbare existence

It’s not a personal success story, any writer can sell 500 copies 

It is the poverty, ironically a mental one, of an industry that has refused to evolve, engage, mature

We are still beating our chests over such disgraceful numbers

One thousand copies sold in one year…compare to the other unlucky fellow…beat your chest

That’s the success- the generator success (my-generator-is-bigger-than-his)

And awards... 

One thousand copies sold in two years, one international award and shortlist of an indigenous award makes a successful Nigerian writer

The literary culture is condescending; it discriminates, it puts people off

Especially in an under-developed Nigeria where N3,000 for instance has to be stretched thin to resolve a number of needs…where does a book come in? 

It is forgotten under a pile of our inaccessible knowledge and practice; this aloof trade that leaves you broke and in need for a substitute

Are we even trying to carry people along?

Your discrimination as a writer affects only you because...guess what, your target audience- fellow writers, do not buy books.

So you'll have to sweat blood to sell 500 copies to 21 million people in Lagos...

And still take 200 copies back home.

You should worry.
