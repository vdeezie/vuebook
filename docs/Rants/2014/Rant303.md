I don’t want to be on any social media platform in 2015.

I would really like to shut it all down.

Twitter goes naturally like a dirty gutter, but…the best PR I’ve done this year was actually replicated very well on twitter.

I met so many great people and enjoyed goodwill in all its Cinderella-esque form with missing heels and charm on Facebook. The bulk of my income too comes from the network I have been able to build and sustain here.

But I have no interest in 99% of what’s going on here. 

Social media consumes too much of your time as an average person; as a publicist, well, I have managed to turn those hours to good income… still, I wish to return to a pen-and-paper lifestyle, of slow mornings and active imagination. 

I want to pick the phone only when a call comes in or sms; not endless beeps from social media dementia.

What I’m trying to say is: I want to keep all the people that mean something to me that I met here, I want to continue selling and running all my projects with zero cost because Facebook (especially) exists…BUT I do not want to be part of it. I do not want to be a member of the social media community, it’s opinions, decisions, or fracas.

Is that possible?

How do I shut the endless ridiculous crotch-itching noise without losing the business side of it?

Can I live in a warm and peaceful farmhouse yet enjoy the benefits of a busy deluded metropolis?

I am burning to make this decision.
