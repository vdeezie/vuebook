This is how it looks…

Top 5 chefs in America:
Shammah- $300m
Kaine - $180m
Rowland- $120m
Steve- $80m
Lala- $35m

In Nigeria, top 5 chefs’ worth:
Diana- N1 billion
Jessica- N100k
Sisi- N50k
Caro- N10k
Jeddiah- *believing God*

If you are in an industry where one individual pulls all the economic worth, you are a disgrace, a shame, an embarrassment. You can just die now. Where is your brain? Your fight?

A developing society must kill monopoly; crush it to pieces beneath the weight of smart thinking.

Monopoly is an evil practice. It will be a dishonour to everything entrepreneurial if our children grow up to meet this mess.

Ask Apple; you are nothing if Samsung takes half the market share. 

When it happens, Apple doesn't sit thanking God for Samsung’s life. No! How do you thank God when ONE person gets the kind of money that can feed all the hungry children in Lagos?

Your brain is weak. 
 
In a proper business society, you crush that fucking Monopoly and create similar businesses that can compete and spread the economic value of that industry.

In Nigeria, they try to replicate EXACTLY what they want to crush without any new features or value, so they become as foolish as a goat running around a tree unaware that it has no shackles on, it can actually take a step beyond its boundaries.

They call people who break monopoly in other nations, game-changers.

In Nigeria, we call them haters.

Nobody wants to be a hater.

So we are all waiting for God to bless us too. 

Have I said how much I hate being "black"?
