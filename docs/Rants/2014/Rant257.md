# Rant257

I observe and I think, and that is my biggest job(lessness).

Writers have a long way to go before we even start talking about getting any kind of economic value for what we do. 

We could start by appreciating the fact that every writer's genius isn't from the same pot of soup.

Writers do not have to be authors.

Can we understand that?

A musician's respect or success shouldn't stem from singing Afro beat or Juju. He can sing whatever the heck he wants!

Does it make any sense then to mock a writer because he doesn't have a book? 

This, of course, is strictly for the Literati and their obsession with poverty.

How many books do Nigerians buy? By all means write a book; but don’t make it a yardstick to judge a writer’s competence.

Abi, is it not in this same Nigeria I have read books that I flung over my head?

How many readers/writers attend book reading? I have witnessed shameful turnouts that would make dead men rise in anger.

This illusion on intellect rid of business acumen is a big fart hairy joke.

I am of the opinion that being a columnist, for instance, is enough for the rest of your life, if you want, as long as you HAVE A MARKET. 

Sincerely, a lot of this discussions are borne out of arrogance and narrow-mindedness.

Let us encourage writers to acquire business knowledge, economic nous. Focus on the money too. Why shouldn't you? You sweat blood to write and then someone is telling you to preserve your "writer's integrity" by not promoting your craft?

Ok, at this point I will admit it is a bit cheesy to continuously rant about your own work; that’s why you need a team to flog that thing till it turns purple on the butt! Get the (right) people to promote your craft.

Make money.

Make money on your first book; heck buy a brand new saloon car with its returns.

Would the clouds fart if a writer becomes rich like other Art(ists)?

How much is Wizkid worth again?

Ok, so he has a right to make millions out of his first single, but you don’t because you are a writer and you should aspire to penury? You should be offended by the possibility of anticipating financial growth?
 
This pathetic schedule of: write first book- make N150k profit; write second book- win one Australian award; write an essay- win an Award from Mars; write a third book- get into the loooooong list for NLGN; write a fourth book- win $5k from one prestigious international award…is a bit trite, played out and boring.

We like our 20-attendees event. We love our N200k profit on books over a 5 year period. We love our big grammar.

We love our lack.

That is why we crawl to other industries to look for jobs. We want money, we just don't want it to look like we are relying on our oh-so intellectual work to provide something as mundane as, well, wealth.

For "The Business of Writing" I have over 240 registered writers (unfortunately, I do not have that kind of sponsorship to have them under one roof). Where have all these writers been? They are suffocating under the basic opinions of a few who want to tell them what to be and what to write.

I have been a writer all my life. Everything that I have done comes from the fact that I Write.

Every single penny I've made- crazy shopping; fees, rents, wild and reckless weekends of spending (I used to stay in fancy hotels every weekend on the Island. Alone. Just to get out of the madness of living. It is an expensive venture).

I have never dated for money; never had an Aristo.

I am a writer who makes money writing. 

And I can reel out a neat list of a few others.

Writing is a FULL TIME job for us, nothing in between. (There are hard days, of course, like any other job)

Don't ever think it is not in your place as a writer to worry about money or the fine things of life.

You are born an artist, not a pauper.
