Let me just advise all of you…

We have Boko Haram, a corrupt and vile political scene, ebola virus, poverty at its shocking state, lowest chance of success at anything we do…what else, zero educational interest…

You better start loving one another as genuinely as possible.

It may be your last.

All these shoulder-raising egoistic love devoid of romance

Who are you fooling?

You miserable Nigerian souls.

Shior!
