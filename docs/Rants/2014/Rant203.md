Dear Nigerian Child,

When I was growing up, I was told to read newspapers to expand my vocabulary, and listen to radio to improve my diction.

I’ll be damned if you try that in 2014.

Our journalists, bless their hustle, indulge in limited words/expressions; the editors are busy trying to “sell” pages to guarantee their next pay cheque. 

It is tough; most people settle for journalism after all their dreams have failed.

So it’s a desperate call; a shove in the butt, with little skill and conditional love

It is not a good thing; you don’t get the chance to learn new words. Press releases are like trash bins, replicated mess spread across every platform.

Radio journalism is a disgrace; there’s no nicer way to put it. It is the dumbest thing you can do to your budding self-esteem and identity.

Local television does not exit. Cable TV is not created to educate you...but you will learn how to wear stockings, how to act like you've got blonde hair, how to sing like Miley Cyrus and how to steal a kiss from a crush. They start teaching you this garbage as early as 4!

The desire to develop your intellect, expand your vocabulary would rest largely on fiction- the best of them, local and international materials. 

Experience lovemaking with words, textual climax, literary masturbation… all in all, Awesome! (not in that sexual term, of course)

Blogs are out of it! Never take the stories or their elementary literature seriously.

Then, by God, you will read Temidayo Ahanmisi every day.

Enjoy her fluidity, grace, versatility; her genius and crisp imagination. 

You read and then you throw your head back, your mouth slightly open… Exhale! 

You have just experienced a miracle.
