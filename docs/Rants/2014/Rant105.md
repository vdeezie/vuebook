People, especially women, keep friends who do not wish them well.

Shockingly they know this, but they have grown too unsure of themselves that they would rather choose to hold on to the tattered robe of scorn disguised as friendship than brace life on their own.

There are stories of how women would work hard to ensure a beloved friend do not climb certain ladders, meet certain people, win certain awards, get into certain circles.

There are people who would choose epilepsy over the success of a friend.

“Friends” who would rather suffer bed bug bites than watch the world congratulate you over a triumphant deed.

Friendship strengthened by the failure of one over the adulation of another.

You are sick- yes you, the one who sits like a leper waiting for another woman to validate you, and holding on to the seam of her dress hoping that one day she will show you kindness; that your “friend” will look down, repent and “help” you.

She may have more connections than you, more naira notes, more clout, more this, more that...but have you no dignity that you allow another human being walk all over you like a doormat?

Ha!

Friendships run like government contracts: you give and give and give of all your self-worth and respect, hoping that one day the millions promised by a bureaucratic individual, sitting atop thousands of connections and millions of naira, will finally grease your palms- a reward for being subservient/beggarly/pitiful for many years.

This your friend... you are waiting that someday she will acknowledge you, and embrace your own achievements, ba? *pffffff!

If you are looking to be a worshipper, is it not better to just serve God? You cannot see Him, so you will never catch Him rolling His eyes at you for being such an idiotic ass-licker.
