There’s a makeshift bar, under a tree, by the corner of my house. It is really a distance away, but everything echoes in Festac. If your neighbour was trying to kill his wife, you would hear the sound like the remnants of really bad music coming from really bad loudspeakers a distance away. The deed would have been done and blood would flow to your door before you recognise that the tragic screams were coming from next door.

So on this night, back from a weekend treat, I am trying to get some work done. 4-storeys away from loud noises coming from under the tree. I can hear women screaming. It is always an uncomfortable feeling when women scream in public; an embarrassing moment where I have to cringe and hold my breath because WE KNOW the element of this public brawl would be centred around…

A man.

Sometimes a joke-of-a-man. Something that should be left in the toilet to clean your ass with after producing a loaf or two.

I can pick a few verbs and adjectives:

Useless, wound, beat, slap, foolish, idiot…Ashawo.

Of course, who goes through a Lagos showdown without two drops or more of "Ashawo" in the cocktail of stupidity?

“You think he loves you? Just using you!”

*sighs*

The man is probably fucking a third woman this minute, and these two retards garbed in dishonor are out fighting for the affection of a penis…

Disturbing my peace!

By all means, pursue your grievances with the fucker, and when you are done, wipe your forehead. That should be enough, shouldn’t it? Leave the other woman out of your rage. 

Life is, after all, a ball. What goes around, bounces right back.

We have a long way to go, women.

A long way.
