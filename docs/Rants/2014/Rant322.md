5 things and 1 question...

Brilliant Facebook moments of 2014

Nicholas Ibekwe’s proud moment against religious stupidity and jingoism. You would never understand if you are not a Nigerian journalist… what Nicholas did should get him an award. Nobody speaks against the sore corruption in journalism (your peers will eat you up and spit you out, your bosses will make life a pit of hell); and nobody speaks against the likes of TB Joshua (unless, of course, in the comfort of twitter- tweeting from your bed after unsafe sex, and feeling like the smartest tweep with the smartest words. Believing, someway, after 19 re-tweets you are some kind of hero). Nicholas rejected that man, his money, his system, his existence…he didn’t stop there; he came out of the gathering, with his peers probably calling him a fool, and wrote about the experience with a tape to back it up.
You will never understand. If we have five of his kind in every system in Nigeria, hope is sure.

Finally realising Nkiru Njoku’s daughter was born blind and the amazing strength and wisdom she (Nkiru) applies to the situation daily and life in general. *phew* That woman is everything. You don’t know. You don’t know.
*** 
Onyeka’s constant rants that throw you off a high building and miraculously heal you. He reminds you it is ok to be wired differently. I find his chaos calming.

Excess goodwill for every event I organised this year, made successful by FB friends who wouldn’t stop calling, texting, sending inbox messages to show their support and love. And others who sponsored full projects, contributed financially and fulfilled promises that were too good to be true, until they were. 
*** 
For Humans of New York’s pictorial stories that are ridiculous, inspiring and patronizing; and links to brilliant short stories, poems and op-eds I clicked and enjoyed.

Now my question: How in the world did Brad Pitt not win the Oscars for ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’? How? This movie is flawless nah. And he gave an accomplished performance. Hian!
