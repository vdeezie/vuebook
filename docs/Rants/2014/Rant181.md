As a writer, two things are important to me:

Money and Audience.

Any platform that is structured to give me up to 600 Facebook likes, and sometimes over 1,000 likes…that is where I want to be.

Sabinews makes writing fun.

Toni Kan encourages your brand as a writer. He’ll send you “love notes”, tell you how fantastic the statistics are:

“Joy mehn! You just had three thousand people read your article in the last hour! What are we talking about? You are a star!”

And he PAYS. You are fit into a structure that works and you are part of a team, part of a salary scheme.

Tomorrow, my 15th article will be up on the site. This is as long as I have ever been with any online platform. 

I get irritated, I get bored, I hate writing to ghosts and that is what many sites are- grave yards. Their articles sit still in dark coffins…because for some reason, the audience just cannot connect with the writer.

I bleed when I write. Every piece leaves me exhausted. I want to be sure someone is reading.

Hello?!

Someone has to read.

Sabinews guarantees that much.

I am a proud writer, very finicky about my craft. I find it difficult to carry on a business relationship with a lot of people because the art of writing is still something they fail to reward consistently. And I am impatient with bullshit.

I have slaved to improve my craft and I deserve whatever is coming to me at this point in my career.

I just want to say thank you to sabinews for not carrying on with the oh-so-typical news style that starts from one blog and grows to multiple websites with different horrendous headlines.

Thank you for making me want to write a new piece every Tuesday evening with a cup of tea by my side. 

Thank you for bringing out all these amazing ideas and witty anecdotes in my head. 

Thank you for pushing all these people to the site to read and connect with writers.

Toyin Saraki reads my articles, I hear.

It is a good feeling, and I am happy.
