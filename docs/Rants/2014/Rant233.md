# Rant233

I am still on a Nicholas high

Before the audio release I had never spoken to him, never even heard of him

So when he said to me, “Joy, I just snapped. Do you know how that feels?”

I replied, “Yes. I know EXACTLY how that feels.”

I hate to pay attention to flies on faeces

Because, really, they gather in vain

The numbers and irritating hum might seem significant

But once you clear the shit, they disappear

In the next one month or so, we shall find flies coming together- journalists writing their own version of events

Even though they weren’t present at the occasion, they would still write fierce polemics against Nicholas

Because they need to protect the browns.

They will give excuses why journalists do what they do

They would hint at publishers not treating them right

And at the general economic rot of the country

Simon Ateba of PM News has done his own

They’ll be more trolls, and they’ll all try to sound smart and cerebral and scholarly

And all their arguments will not be worth as much as bird poop on your windshield.

This is how we deal with crises in Nigeria

We beat the good man down with excuses and claims of fabrication.

Their numbers will increase like flies to faeces

They are dead matter. Their aim is to make us remain the way we are

Nicholas is change- that you do not have to bow to a system that has turned you into a beggar, a vagrant...

That you do not have to scuffle for browns in front of executives who see you like dogs and chimps and wish for you to disappear from their squeaky offices

Anything or anyone that tries to beat down Nicholas' truth is of the devil

And their aim is to keep us here, where we are- beneath integrity and honour and dignity

We have heard all your rants before. Save it, we don’t care.

I choose change.

Hear Simon Ateba: “The truth is this, as long as journalists in Nigeria are not paid for months or are given irregular crummy salaries, as long as they are not insured, as long as publishers pocket all the corrupt money they get in the forms of adverts or special reports from corrupt politicians, and as long as Nigerians refuse to spend their money on newspapers, which push publishers to solicit money from politicians who have pocketed everything, many journalists will continue to accept gifts, bribes or whatever you call it.”

What an excuse! 

If the media is corrupt, should it justify bribe? (You are the media, so why are YOU corrupt? Ask yourself)

If you are broke and you stumble on a bank, should it justify robbing the bank?

Should your hunger validate theft?

Should your mean upbringing excuse prostitution or murder?

The fact that your are 15 and pregnant, does it give you the right to flush the baby down the toilet?

Journalists think they are the only ones with a tough non-paying job in Nigeria. I laugh! The media is built on integrity. It is a job of sacrifice and it is not structured to make you a Bill Gates. You don't have to be a journalist really. Don't excuse your wrongs. 

As an alternative to the ridiculous tripe you may want to feed us- your gullible audience, as an attack and rebuttal of Nichola’s deed, I suggest you save your energy and build your house instead- a crumbling sham.

Leave Nicholas alone.
