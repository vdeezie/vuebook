“We did some good work (at Next newspaper). In terms of Naira and Kobo, we brought in N100m in three months, which is commendable for a new paper. He (Dele Olojede) had lied about so many things. He did not have money and could not afford to pay our salaries. When we came, someone in finance sent me a memo that if we continued with our solid marketing, we would be out of the woods in eight weeks. But I just knew that when someone lies to you from day one, the foundation of your relationship is already weak. He did not understand anything about handling a newspaper..." - Toni Kan

Toni Kan, years back, had dragged me by the ear and asked that I come work for Elan (Next glossy pull-out) as the editor (when Kemi left). I said, but it's just fashion, I am not a fashion editor, I am a lifestyle Editor.

“Na you sabi,” he said.

Then I said, "Ok."

The appointment was booked and I was to meet with two female executive heads at Next.

“Why did you leave Genevieve magazine?”

“Personal issues; I am trying to get a divorce…” 

“Is that…errr…sorted now?”

“Kinda, I have put it under my armpit for now,” I said without penitence.

Maybe that, or what I had on- black polka dot shirt and chewing gum.

Of course, they didn’t call back.

I picked a copy sometime later and saw that the “feral scent” chick, Adaobi Nwaubani, was the new editor.
 
I kuku went to drink a cup of tea in my house. LMAO!

I got that excerpt (above) from Toni Kan's interview with cre8tiventreps.com, nice stuff:
