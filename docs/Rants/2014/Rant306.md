Because I am tired of cooking pots of soups and stews that I never remember to eat, I decided to get amala, instead, at the neighbouring buka.

So I drove down with my bowl oh.

I bought amala and they had only goat meat; so yes.

There was this man, badly infuriated by this:

“I don’t understand how una go talk say no meat! Why no meat?! What kind of nonsense is all this? Una nor sabi plan una daily calendar? It is rubbish! Rubbish! How una nor go get meat???”

Elderly man, late 50s or so, harassing the woman…because there’s no meat for him to eat with his eba.

It’s not like she’s your wife, or your daughter or your maid… it’s a freaking third-world buka. Buy what you see and shut the hell up!

All this aggression because there’s no N50 beef, now he has to either eat his eba with a lonely plate of soup or cough out N300 for a piece of goat meat.

That is his annoyance; even without telling. 

His frown wasn't going anywhere anytime soon, he worked himself up, grumbling and hissing.

Just go to the market and buy your own beef already, in the quantity you want; the choice part your gluttony desires.

Save your hostility for when you'd really need it.
