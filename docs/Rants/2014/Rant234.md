Nigerians are argumentative.

In our deplumed, fanatical state, we will argue any point until the moon shrinks to a piece of paper and drops from the sky

It’s the only way we can feel important, alive.

Mainly the reason satire should work; but even that doesn’t.

What should make you laugh and ponder, turns Nigerians into psycho-analytical idiots

We can turn any subject on its head.

A man has been beating his wife constantly in a, say, 25 year old marriage; when the matter hits the Nigerian social circle, you’ll hear arguments like:

“At least she has produced five healthy sons and has kept a home.”

You are championing a cause for “Zero Tolerance to Domestic Violence”, and there’ll be fierce polemics stating: 

“Are you now saying that women should not work out their differences in their marriages?”

Can you see how the average Nigerian reasons? Like a child deprived of nourishment, suffering from kwashiorkor.

Our brains are kwashiorkor-ed.

Show the Nigerian the colour- grey, for instance,  and these are the type of arguments that will ensue:

“The spelling is wrong, it should be gray.”

“I guess you skipped primary one because the spelling is as it is- grey.”

“Is this really grey?”

“Grey is a touch darker, so please get your facts right.”

“If God says it is black then no matter the colour, it becomes black, so this might not be grey.”

“My husband says it is blue.”

“Grey is black inverted.”

“Some people are condemning this grey but if they find themselves in grey’s position would they want to be grey or purple?”

THIS is how we argue, like people constantly fucked from the wrong hole.

So when you tell me that journalists are entitled to transport money from any recipient of their service, I will tell you that you are an idiot.

Journalism is a job, they have employers, and they are supposed to have daily weekly transport allowance.

I know magazine genre is different, but as an editor at the different glossies I have worked, my reporters had daily/weekly allowances to cover for transport and refreshment.

Now if your employer isn’t doing that, go and demand it.

How do you stay in a job for seven months, for instance, without pay; yet you remain there and continue working. 

Your lack and desperation become cologne that fill a room; your needs attack you from every side that you begin to hustle and fight for ridiculous amounts; grovel for pennies from sources that owe you nothing!

At this point in the career of every journalist, you and your publisher are to blame for your troubles.

No one else. 

Go and demand your wages. Fight who you should. Don’t tell us to look at it this way and that way that makes you the innocent victim of a corrupt system.

I am a publicist and I deal with journalists and I GIVE THEM MONEY.

I represent movie stars and musicians- the fluffy things of life. 

That I wish a client to be interviewed, it is a service I am requesting for; I give something. I work their stipends into the budget.

These services do not have the capacity to change the price of garri in the market; these services do not control stock exchange, the economy; these services do not decide the price of life.

We are talking music and movies… like candy and cookies, NOT DEATH.

Not 100 people under the rubble of a collapsed building.

There’s no blood on the dance floor when I tell them to interview a client for his upcoming album.

No blood, just champagne and glitz.

We are sitting across each other, talking about the designer who made the dress, Louboutin, the budget of this-and-that, her hair- how she gets it looking natural and fab; we talk about who he’s dating, when he wants to get married, where he spends his summer vacation…

We are not talking about rape and dead bodies and bloody conspiracies.

That I have to explain these things is the saddest part of our declining intellects.

This should be straightforward in any society with enough milk on the table; but in Nigeria with parents thrusting bowls to 3 year-old children to go and buy amala for breakfast, you will continue to argue why it is shocking and outrageous for any journalist to sit on top dead bodies, nodding, collecting browns and stating that it shall be reported as your lordship commands.

We argue like that, as if our brains come with ellipses- empty spaces of cerebral languor.

PS: Just watch, someone will post a comment soon to tell me my grey needs an extra “y” for it to be accurate. 

Just. Watch.
