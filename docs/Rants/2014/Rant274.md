Heehee! Saturday at #MyLagosStory was hilarious.

Let me tell the full story:

So I went out with my bestie, Prisca, one hot Saturday afternoon to the cinema. We decided to have drinks first before a movie.

The only movie showing at the time was October 1. Prisca didn’t want to watch “Nollywood”. I didn’t care. Anything that would shut the sun out was fine by me.

She begged that we go some place else- suggested the beach, I refused; got the movie tickets and she sulked all the way into the theatre. I love her but I wasn't paying any attention LOL!

30 minutes into the movie, the sulking was gone and she was enjoying it as much as I was. None of us was prepared for what we watched.

After a thrilling experience, I told her: “I’m going to find that guy, Prince Aderopo. I'll holler at him.”

And she replied, “Nor be you?! E go kuku follow you like perfume.”

LOL!

So immediately I got home, before the sweet aroma from the cooking pot disappeared into thin air, I found him on Facebook and sent a message.

It was his fan page, so he replied three days later, then I linked to his personal page.

We decided to meet. Turned out to be four hours of really fun time talking about everything. Amazing stuff.

But that is not the koko of the gist...

All my friends, beautiful and cynical, kept teasing me: “Abegi! Guy nor too fine like that. E just dey dia!”

And I kept telling dem, “nor be by picture oh; see the guy first before you make your conclusions.”

And so they met him on Saturday…

Here are their comments:

Funke: “Chai Joy! See fine boi! I don die! Abeg tell am make e comot shirt. I wan’ take foto!”

Prisca: “Please, abeg, Demola…I had a question for you but…I can’t…I just can’t remember right now…while I try to reset my brain, are you single?”

Bunmi: “Joy abeg, before you invite this kain person come, give us warning. What if my heart stops beating now because of this kain hot gorgeousness, ehn? I go tell God say na man kill me?!”

Bukola: “I…I…I know that I cannot compete with all these women for your attention, so please can we just be good friends” LMAO!!!

Then Funmi: “So..errr..what is the susceptible inflammation of the incredulous…superfluous…err…marinade…” (she ended up asking a very valid question though LOL!)

I have the best friends! *heehee*
