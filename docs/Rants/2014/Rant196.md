I love the feel of a new morning, of the hopelessness it brings...waking up to the uncertainty of a new day.

I love the rains, the soothing wretchedness it leaves behind…

The smell of new books; the smooth sound of flipping pages, the words that leap to kiss me

For great conversations that I find and cherish before they thaw to conceit 

For all the songs that have shaped my heart.

The goose bumps I get when love happens once every while.

For friendships that last through a glass of wine…

For a hot plate of white rice and stew...for a great pot of afang soup.

For everything that makes my heart beat- a daughter’s laughter, a mother’s support…

For positive energy...

So the things I cannot afford do not become my burden.
