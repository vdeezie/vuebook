Be a Lifepreneur.

I was sitting in a friend’s office after I left Genevieve magazine, unsure of the next thing to do, and this friend (who, for some reason, has disappeared under the radar of foolish assumptions) asked:

“What happened?”

“I am tired,” I said, “I have all these married men- way older than me, earning a pinch of my salary who are out to frustrate my effort…”

“You do know they are just jealous, right?”

I did, but I was too naïve to know how to deal with jealousy and bitter envy then. (You should see me deal with envy or controversy now especially those clothe in friendship. My methods will leave you…dizzy).

Then he said something that has stayed with me ever since:

“Joy, you must learn to inhale fart in some quarters so you don’t eat shit in other quarters. Inhale the fart from this jealous old bad writers and executives so you do not eat shit from the proprietor of your children’s school or your landlord.”

It remains one of the most profound words I have heard. Basic stuff, but it altered my lifestyle.

I have learned to inhale the fart; it stays only a few seconds anyways. It is the shit that follows you and gathers flies to embarrass you for days that never end.

Life is a business. There’s a reason why we tell people who run their lives on an emotional/sentimental high to “grow up!”

Life IS a business.

Don’t make rash decisions. Don’t shut doors with a hard thud. Don’t be ruled by your ego. Don't make enemies just because you can. Haba!

Human beings are incredibly shallow. If you understand that, you win.

They move with the trends:

Check twitter (which, as far as I am concerned, is the bird house of irredeemable losers and their shag partners):

“Ah! Do you see how Stella Dimorkrackass abused her? I do not pray for anyone to be Jojo for all the insult she has received…”

You see, it is only people with adulterated engine oil spurting out of their brains that tweet with such finality on issues they know absolutely nothing about. They just tweet, jobless, horny and razz, because they need to beat one down to feel like they can have a chance at anything remotely successful. 

Check back in a few months...they are singing a different (off) tune:

“Wow! She’s good at what she does.”

Same person, different opinions. It shows a decay in your sense of reasoning when you tuck your brain in between your ass. All of that shit clogging cognitive ability… 

Be smarter than the average retard. Be smarter than the average twitter crackhead building tweet cred on how many subs it can make per second.

Followers, as they are rightly called.

Apply yourself to life and the people you meet like you apply yourself to your job.

Take life "seriously"… with a glass of something you enjoy by the side.
