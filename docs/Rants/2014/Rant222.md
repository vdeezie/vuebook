The gratitude train gets to me. I shall roll all of 7 days at once… 

Day1: I’m grateful for words that leap out of the pages of books to caress my body, kiss me and lead me to bed.

Day2: I’m grateful for family that loves me like… kilode

Day3: I’m grateful for Eros love… burning physical attraction…goose bumps from a touch…hands grabbing my butt…words soaked in lust… kisses on my cleavage…eyes for only me… 

Day4: I’m grateful for a writing career that pays well

Day5: I’m grateful for my independence; that I get to be what I want to be

Day6: I’m grateful for Dominos pizza that opened recently in my ‘hood

Day7: I’m grateful for death that denies man immortality, restores dignity, answers the questions on tyranny, and saves a few more from wanton penury.

I am not nominating anyone, biko.  

It’s actually a ridiculous self-absorbed exercise… and to think that people do this for 7 days??! Hian!
