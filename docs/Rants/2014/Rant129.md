LOL!

They have started with the vile comparison

I had expected it earlier

I will not feed your foolish appetites

Pop writing shouldn’t always come with idiotic "fans"

You are an idiot if you try to create unnecessary rivalry between writers

And I will delete your ass

Like I just did one.

You can read and leave your comment

Why should you be so stupid as to blow the embers of people's ego

And while you are trying to act like some overfed chihuahua…

Do yourself a favour, check the figures

Figures don’t lie. 

Your deliberate scheme is the saddest thing in the world...

And the figures will still be there to laugh in your face.
