An acquaintance told me her story yesterday: 

She got married to a man who would tie her up and have other men have sex with her while he watched. At the end of the humiliation, he managed to throw her in jail for two days and then she was kicked back to Nigeria like a shot from Messi. Back to a country she had left all her glory; now a rut, she has to start all over again in her mid-40s.

PS: The details of everything, I do not have. It was an unburdening, and for reasons best known to her, she chose me. So why did she stay through all that abuse? I don't know. 

Please don't come here saying: "If it was me, I won't take that nonsense." 

We know. We know you are Storm.The toughest shit on the bloc. Save it. It's her story. Let her be! 

And like all the heartrending confessions I hear, I could only mutter: "Wow. So sorry this had to happen to you."

So what did you say you can't let go of? 

Oho!
