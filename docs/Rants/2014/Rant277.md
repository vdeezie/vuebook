OK!

As you all know (or don’t know) I am organising a classy Literati “concert” this December for writers, arty performers, dancers, stage actors etc

-Because we need these alternatives beyond AY comedy shows or Rhythm Unplugged or Trace Music concert…

I ask the question: what about me? A writer who is tired of recycled jokes, who isn’t interested in walking through the Atlantic sand to listen to Dbanj sing “Why me”

What about me- defined under “new writing”, in love with fashion, good men, dark movies, and involved in cheeky easy reads, working out new methods of getting my voice beyond just a few dreadlocked clan.

I create what I want.

So I created #ThisArtIsEnough

I had a few prospective companies and individuals for sponsorship as I always do; and then I start making the calls, voice training to sound like: your-money-is-safe-with-me…

Usually, I would talk to 10 people, and I get five people interested.

Eventually, 3 people put money down, enough to run the show.

Same technique I planned for this…

So I sent an email to the first person…waited…waited

24 hours later, there’s a call and:

“This Art Is Enough. Nice. What’s the entire cost, Joy. I’ll pay everything. Now go and get a manicure or something. You are doing a great job. Send your bank details.”

This happened barely 15 minutes ago, so I am still a little dizzy.

I am dizzy.

Life is funny.

When I used to give a shit; when I used to be careful with my words; when I was a “Nigerian woman”- quiet and lost; afraid to be alone; when I wanted to be liked and appreciated; when I cared what people thought and how they responded to me…

Nothing happened.

Nothing. My life was a long lonely road. 

I would do what most people did- pray my way to happiness by posting and proclaiming it ten times a day; my life was a tiny nothing. Just too ordinary. unexciting, bland in that my-baby-loves-me hogwash. 

You would think life would respond to the “good Joy”.

Now, I am this rebellious thing. And I get calls from representatives of United Nations to speak at breakfast events with the kind of African Women I have spent my entire life revering.

I send one email and I get a favourable response.

I am just a woman in search of herself. 

I stumbled on me…

And it worked. 

The love I receive blows my mind!
