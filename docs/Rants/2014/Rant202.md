I like playing with the Male character in my prose

To think like the "other gender" and try to depict his views and judgments are a lot harder but that is where the fulfillment comes as a writer

-Because I am not male, and it is easy to “fight” the Woman-Movement… very easy

So where’s the adventure? That I can creep into a man’s head and understand how he processes life- his job, his masculinity, his environment, his insecurities, his woman…

Women hate that I do that. The backlash on whose-side-are-you-on never ends

I’m just a writer, a curious one. 

I’m comfortable being a woman and I can tell you a hundred and one ways how not to treat us…

But any woman can do that.

I know what I know…but what about the next person? What about the other gender?

I might not even be accurate, yet I find that with building these male characters, I can build empathy and appreciation

And it’s all satire, really.

But then I say that everyday…and women in heels and expensive weaves- the bunch you think would have some form of illumination, after traveling from Dubai to UK, will still be tearing their bra straps on Joy’s fiction.

But if it imitates life, then why don’t you just accept it and enjoy your life play out before you, ehn?

Anyways…my weekly hot cup of tea is on sabinews, my Male character is a piece of work, isn’t he? ROTFL!
