I have used one phone for over three years.

It is old, tired, battered, and begging for retirement…

The back cover falls off every time I pick it

When I click the camera, the battery dies immediately

It is too old to take a picture, too old to open complicated sites.

It needs to be charged three times a day

I always forget to keep it out of sight when I am in a meeting;  so I am left with strange looks as the client sees the phone then looks at me...looks at the phone again and tries to make a connection *heehee*

It may not be the easiest device to use.

But I am loyal to it.

I will not give up on it just because I can buy another.

I stay loyal regardless of the situation.

This is how I treat the people in my life.

I stay. And give. And believe.

But the world doesn’t need people like us.

They need those who’d get a replacement the minute they can.

I think I will tie a rubber band around it tomorrow.

The poor ailing thing.
