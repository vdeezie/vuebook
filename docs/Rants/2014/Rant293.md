What do I have to do to mute these atheists on my Timeline? 

I am serious. What do I have to do to mute this people?

Do I have to un-friend every single one of them for peace sake?

People obsessed with a God that does not exist

Every single minute, there’s a mock post with an orgy taken place on my Timeline.

If I believe in God and you don’t, why don’t you leave me to my belief?

I am going to un-friend every single atheist on my timeline. 

If you are my friend, you have my number. I do not have to deal with your thoughts on Facebook. Say hello, ask about my day and drop the phone. Live with your own issues, your unbelief, let me live with mine. Deal?

As pathetic as humans are, with your average life, why should I be inspired to be an atheist?

You have a regular job like everyone else, live on a regular street, do regular things, make regular income; desire the regular things of life. You must have begged for N10k before; lobbied to get a business pact; you have cried at night, suffered a stomach ache; bled from your nose. You must have dreamed of a better future.

You are just average, you are just human. So why do you think you are superior and we are stupid?

Why do I have to keep up with your disrespect when you add no real value to my life?

But it’s ok if you don’t believe in Him. I do. Can't we just get along? 

Can you just be content with what you are and not have loud sex just so we know you have finally found someone who can stand the smell of your underwear?

A lady woke me up this morning, telling me my trousers will send me to hell. It was barely 5am, with a voice that jumped at me, attacking me through an amplifier. 

From the distance, I could tell her breath stank. She wants me to serve God by fire by force.

Usually these type get me all riled up. But today it was different; she didn’t seem to get to the core of my disgust. She is not even half as judgmental as atheists on Facebook.

Dear atheists, if you can un-friend me first, it will be appreciated. Do not take offence when I do. It is personal.
