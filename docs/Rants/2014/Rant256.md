You know what? I get it.

I finally get it!

I understand why it is difficult for the Nigerian to comprehend anything other than when to eat, where to go, who to marry, how many kids to have, how to make an extra buck, and what religion to wrap around his/her head.

I get it now. 

I mean, look at the education you receive.

From home, probably a religious one, where you had to be in church twice a week and the rest of what is left of you is trained to be an expert liar- lying to your father where you are heading to because as a 17 year old adult, you are not expected to have a girl/boyfriend. Nigerian parents are deluded enough to believe you should not grow any kind of relationship beyond what they endorse which, of course, would mean sticking around at home and taking advice from aunties and uncles whose lives, if well scrutinized, are tragi-comedies. 

Some of you finally inhaled “freedom” at 21 when you escaped to one of the rot called Universities in Nigeria.

You sit in class and hear a lecturer talk and talk- its all theory; where are the labs? The computers? The studios?

We were asked once in a Polytechnic class to "close your eyes and imagine yourself in a studio recording  your first radio programme."

Yes, we had to imagine it because there were no studios available!

That’s why we are all still in trance. A daze of stupidity that needs a hard kick.

Our comprehension is soiled and warped.

The Nigerian argument remains the saddest thing in the world. And I always come back to it because if we don’t fix comprehension, we can’t achieve much.

It is a big problem; for conversationalists like me it is worse than rabies.

Ah! Good bras are everything = The Nigerian response: “No, God is everything.”

I hate being "black" = The Nigerian response: “Bleaching is bad. You must learn to appreciate who you are. As a humanist, we have to move the blackness of who we are." (read this again, see how lost this humanist is?)

I walk on water = “Are you Jehova?”

The Nigerian cannot express true emotions = The Nigerian response: “Not all Nigerians”

We leave the crux of every matter, running after shadows! 

Crush monopoly = The Nigerian response: “Don’t be a hater.”

It is painful to live in a society where conversation is impossible.

We are impossible.

It is the quality of our institutions- from family, to Universities that have wrecked our ability to converse intelligently.

Please, let us buy some common sense whilst constantly shopping for transient things like LV bags, Prada shoes and SUVs.
