When we agitate for good society, let us remember to pull out the rot in the pie-

People who just never get to see or admit the wrongdoing of anyone they have benefited from, especially in spiritual or monetary terms.

They are worse than the evil spirits that come back, seven times more, to take on an empty house…

They are more spiteful than witches, more heartless than the real perpetrators of crime…

If, for instance, Pastor Coconuthead “healed” your daughter of cough…

Then one day a truth overflows to your balcony with damning information that can douse all your respect for the pastor

New information claim he is a paedophile and there are young girls on blogs, as young as 5 years, confessing on tape that he had poked fingers into their vagina 

If your response is a ridiculous... “Please this man has done nothing. This is a man of God and he was the one who helped my family when my daughter had cough. Why didn’t he sexually molest my own daughter? These children and their parents are up to no good. Do not take this news seriously as people might just be jealous of the man..."

You have ceased to be a human being.

The question is: must you have an opinion even when you can see you are clearly out of your league? 

How do you process information with your head tucked into another man's anus.

Some people will defend others because of N2,000 transport money they gave them five years ago!

In 2014, your N2k benefactor is paraded as a fraud on blogs. Your reaction? You come on social media ranting like a pig, telling us about the N2k he gave you in 2008... And because of that "kind" act, you believe he is innocent.

*sighs*

I have to keep painting these pictures just so you can see how clearly daft you are.
