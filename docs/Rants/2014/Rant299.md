# Rant299


December 9, 2014


I’ll like to say a big thank you to the 70+ people who bought my book at #ThisArtIsEnough

Thank you, because I know it is based on trust- trust that Joy’s fiction will be cheeky, colourful and fun to read. 

Or may be you bought it to, well, see what the hype is all about sef.

Still, I appreciate.

What if I tell you I am not quite happy with it?

It took me a full year back-and-forth with Jude Dibia, scrubbing and dusting sentences, editing, still with the aim of retaining my voice.

When the print-ready PDF file came back to me, I had Dami Ajayi read it. 

He liked it. Even laughed. An hour later he regurgitated some of it and chewed it again, laughing.

So I was confident. Too confident, in fact. I know my audience, I was ready to show off this work.

I don’t write about calabashes and Iroko trees and endless poverty, I write about sex and heels and lipstick and hot legs in a pair of jeans.

So there.

Now getting this book, all wrapped up looking pretty, I am happy.

I flip through quickly, it looked nice. Shouldn’t it? After all, I submitted a freaking PDF file in a format that should be safe.

But this is Nigeria, where you pay throat-slashing sums for the most mediocre service. 

This is Nigeria where, regardless of how much you pay, you STILL have to get the job done by yourself! Every single detail, by yourself.

-Because people are just incompetent.

So Saturday evening, after #ThisArtIsEnough, I am in heaven. I sleep like a baby. 

Sunday, I pick all the congratulatory calls and respond to all the messages.

Monday, I finally pick up my book to read, with the confidence of one who, like all the events I organise, has everything in order.

I am tormented by jumbled words, typos, missing lines, incomplete sentences.

Every author’s nightmare!

I open my PDF, still as crisp as when it was sent.

So what went wrong? Why all these typos and this…this…*sighs*

“When we converted to this-and-that…” goes the lame excuse.

Just shut up already. Nigerians, just shut up! All this 1900 excuses. Shut up! 

What does it take to print a freaking document in the way it should be printed?

What does it take, after collecting my hard-earned money, to ensure the work is done properly?

Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we compromise all the time?

I have troubled the people I can trouble, just so they can console me and tell me, “it is not that bad.”

But it is bad. Why should “bad” find its way in? This is a wrong representation of the work I did.

We have to get the small things right in this country. The small things…like ensuring a book matches the cost, the alarming cost paid for, especially when samples were sent.

I am tired. And angry. And upset.

15 people paid into my account today.

But I am not proud of this print. I hate it. How do you cringe at your own book?!!!

I have shouted and spat out my lungs with blood- both at the consultant and printer.

I will re-print, and I will send you fresh copies.

And then I can hold my book readings (two sponsored readings I now have to cancel)

And I will not spend one naira extra for the job. Not one naira! 

I think it is evil, this. And I will pour my angst into it.
