# Rant246

I am going to talk about this, and move away from it quickly…

-Because the action of these type people is so insensitive, it could leave you with an infection.

One of the most disrespectful acts on Facebook is when a personal interview is conducted on a nominee for an award, then someone comes with a big fat empty head and no brain (if it hit the floor it would sound like a loud can of nothing after its content has been devoured), and leaves a direct comment that suggests someone else (because they are obviously friends) deserves the award.

Haba! Do we need to go back to primary school? 

Simple courtesies- Do not pee in my cup of tea.

It is not only disgusting, it is stupid in the way that domestic turkeys are stupid with their sex drive.

If anyone would ever do that on a thread about me as a nominee of any award… 

Hmmph! Just know you are dead. I will screw you up with my pen (sorry, keyboard) you wouldn’t be able to find your way home.

People are just so disrespectful with an irresponsible itch for relevance.

See, you do not have to like people. Nigerians are always thirsty to be in one clique or the other, forming smart-ass cool-ass fly-anus.

BUT you must learn to respect, especially if all you have against that person is the fact that they are on the same list with your friend who you'd rather pick for the prize; your  claim to friendship; some allegiance to fuckery.

Thank God you are not a judge. Thank God you are not God.

It takes a whole new level of stupidity to come on an interview and have an opinion about who should take home a prize.

ON AN INTERVIEW DEDICATED TO ONE OF THE NOMINEES.

You could leave your biased rant on the website; but Facebook is a personal space.

Get it?

PS: And these people...their loyalties are worth less than a cup of smoothies. They jump ship fast without a trace of their past. Watch, let someone else win, they'll start the praises of that one and forget all about their "friend".
