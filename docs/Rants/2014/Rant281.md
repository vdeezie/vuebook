The amazing Molara Wood just shared a story with me…

So there she was having lunch when two (or three?) Chinese walked in.

They were having a conversation, looking for a book to buy…

“Eko Dialogue,” they said.

They said it again.

Molara turned and smiled, “It’s by Joy Isi Bewaji.” 

“Yes!” they smiled back. 

So she gave them my number and email address.

Maybe I should edit that small book and do a reprint.

Femi Odugbemi told me only yesterday, “If you know how many lectures I’ve held with Eko Dialogue as the theme and body of my work, you’ll be asking me to pay you by now.”

Yes, a reprint. 

Probably.
