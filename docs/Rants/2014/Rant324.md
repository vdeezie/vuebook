When my generator repairer comes around we usually have conversation. He is not educated in a four-wall system with a teacher wielding a cane, or in dirty hostels and faeces in polythene bags sense of it, but he is smart and is well-trained in the school of hard knocks. So I usually engage him in a chat and he blows my mind always with his sense of direction, focus and well-rounded opinions on just about everything- delivered in crisp pidgin English.

I believe in him. Even when my mother, who introduced me to him had an argument and then told me not to patronize him anymore, I refused. Their wahala is their wahala, why should I build my own judgment based on their own wahala? Hian! LOL! I allowed her seething anger cool off and then reconciled them.

Last week he called to see if he should drop by to check my generators for Christmas before travelling. That, of course, adds another feather to his cap. Proactive at work; and sincerely, after he is done there’d be no need of fear for another 3 months which would then require a change of oil and general servicing.

So he came and as usual I dragged a stool  and we chatted as he worked, and once in a while he’d educate me on parts of the generator I could handle by myself if it was an emergency, like plugs and changing the oil and stuff.

I know my neighbours think I’m crazy, considering that I have invisible boundaries that I expect people to “see” and follow. When I chat with neighbours, there are rules: three seconds for chat and one second to share a smile; and that’s it. I don’t think they see all of that with my generator repairer and it must make them wonder. 

This is where I’m heading to: a former friend (we don’t hang out anymore) stops by my house; she just got a Land Cruiser and wanted me to see it. Green heavy coffin like that. I was happy for her. She came up to my flat where I sat on a stool chatting with my generator repairer, and she had that look she refused to hide: 
“what are you doing out here chatting with your repairer?”

I answered with the same look: “I am having a good conversation, something you would know nothing about; isn’t that why I stopped hanging out with you?”

I’m not sure she got my look, so she proceeded to gist me on how fabulous her life is and how her husband should be thankful to have her and how this-is-great and that-is-super. Cool. But she was interrupting us (repairer and I) in our own gist. We were talking about life in Ajegunle (that’s where he stays) and how easy it is to become a religious moron, always praying, always believing your neighbour or a village witch or your landlord or even your mother is behind your stunted growth; and his opinion on these issues blew my mind; and then we’d move to marriages and kids…and again, this repairer who I am not sure finished secondary school will speak with such wisdom and coherence. It was he who told me about OLX and stuff he has bought on the platform (not that I would want to use the service, but you get my drift). A sound individual by all standards, deserving of RESPECT.

Respect. That was something my so-called friend refused to show him.

She leaned on the railing, irritated by our camaraderie and decided to poke holes into it.
“Are you sure that oil you are using is original? All these useless artisans using fake things every where…what about that part you are holding, I hope you didn’t collect it from a bad generator to bring to sell to my friend? I don’t trust all this nonsense people…”

I nudged her quietly to stop. I don’t talk to my generator repairer like that. Never. I don’t accept anybody talking to him like that when he is working for me. Not my mother and definitely not some random friend.

Of course, there are people I talk to like that, totally deserving of it.- sales girls at shops, customer service executives in almost every organization, retarded individuals generally. Yes, people like that.

The driver who takes me everywhere bought my books and my CDs- over five copies each and gave to his colleagues at the park. He paid for them! My mechanic sent Christmas gift to my house… that is the kind of relationship I have with the artisans I have decided to keep in my life. 

If I find them frustrating and below the intelligent quotient I can tolerate then there’s no point having them around. I won’t let an artisan's idiocy get to me and generate anger or disrespect. The minute it happens, that business relationship is over. But to have them around and continue to yap disrespectfully makes You a tad of a lunatic.

The repairer was a good sport, he smiled and ignored my “friend”. 

Later on I told her plainly, “I don’t appreciate that. You acted and talked like the uneducated one.”

“Na wa oh! On top ordinary generator man?”

She doesn’t get it. I doubt she ever will.
