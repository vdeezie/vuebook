I just watched 'A Little Bit of Heaven' featuring Kate Hudson. She had colon cancer and was dying.

During a surgery procedure, she went to heaven briefly and met with God who clearly told her: "babes, you are dying."

When she approached the white couch sitting the figure, she realised God was Whoopi Goldberg.

"Oh my God! Whoopi?! You are God?!"

"No, not really. But this is what you imagined me to be. So, yes."

"Yes, yes! I am a huge fan of Whoopi," she smiled.

So when I finally get to heaven, God is going to look just like Usher Raymond- in all his sexiness and beauty.

So cool!

God rocks.
