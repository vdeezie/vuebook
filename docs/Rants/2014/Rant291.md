# Rant291


November 29, 2014

I have been to two “Jonathan events”. The first one was two years ago (I think) in partnership with The Future Awards and other bodies. Stephanie Linus gave me two tickets, Chude gave me two tickets. I took one flower from the bouquet and went on my own to experience it. 

Later on, I heard Nollywood and other guests were struggling for enveloped sums. I don’t know where the hell that came from. I attended that event and went home when it was over, as I expect everyone did.

Other establishments have sent invites on conferences at Aso Rock, "100 youths" meeting with the President in Abuja type events. I couldn’t make myself available for these camaraderie.

Now I am preparing for #ThisArtIsEnough, my book is coming out, I have a line-up of events stretching into 2015, back-to-back activities, I get a call and an invite- three invites actually, one I send to my reporter, and I say to myself, “why not?” Go see how writers like to have fun, I can learn a thing or two for my own events. And most importantly, wear a damn chic dress, pin your sexy curls, wear red heels and go and dance on the President’s account!

Yup!

And I did! I had a GREAT time. Shout out to Timi Dakolo, especially, for that awesome song.

So when I come online and hear shit about money being shared, I am thinking: this fictitious sum that people talk about all the time, is it like Casper that vanishes the minute you blink?

I am not a self-righteous Nigerian. I do not discuss politics or its ilk because, really, political rants and ranters are just one fat envelope away from sealed lips (except Nicholas Ibekwe, of course). Nigerians have a conscience the size of a mustard seed.

Look at every segment of your life that makes up the mass called Nigeria and tell me if you cannot trace corruption from your door to your workplace and back. Is it not the same story of corruption replicated in colourful versions and sizes?

So people are wishing me all the best, hailing me and telling me about national cake because I am off to eat rice, watch Sunny Ade perform, enjoy Rex Lawson’s biopic and dance to Omawumi? People are sending inbox messages telling me to “please hook me up” “help my ministry” “I want to get to know you”

Why? -Because we are all corrupt. Our heads are buried in a shit of corrupt beliefs and practices.

And yet we justify our reasoning based on the crime of politicians?

This fictitious sum of N150k, expected to appear somewhere between midnight and masturbation, is it supposed to buy my conscience, feed my kids fat and then pay for my vacation this season? Not to forget, my children’s new school fees that is just a few weeks away… is this conjured sum-of-any-amount the ticket to financial freedom?

Let me check; did Santa Claus drop the shit into my purse as I was leaving Eko Hotel?
 
I am not amused.
