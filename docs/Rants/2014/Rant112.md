A 6-pack Enid Blyton series gift from my wonderful friend, Funke Tega Phillips, to my daughters.

My girls are going to screech like sports cars when they get back from the weekend-with-grandma.

I'll leave it on the table in the living room...

Jolade will probably be the first to see it (she surveys the house every time she walks in)

Jolade: Mummy what's this?

Ife: Oh my God! Enid Blyton books!

Jolade: Wow!

Ife: Yipee!!!

Thanks, Funke! :)
