Have you ever heard arguments like these:

“Hian! There’s no fuel in my neighbourhood.”

“That doesn’t mean there is scarcity, fuel is in MY own neighbourhood. Shebi you live at Isale Eko, things are slow down there. Everything is fine. There is fuel.”
*** 
“The money spent on Nigerian weddings is alarming.”

“MY cousin got married to the love of his life, he spent N10million, and they are living a very comfortable life. It is alarming for those who are poor.”
*** 
“Nigeria cannot afford to hold on to another new born; the economy is in shambles, education is a rag; there are no facilities to build these children.”

“Let people make up their own decisions. MY father brought up seven respectable lawyers and doctors and we are doing fine. Even the akara seller in front of my house is taking care of six children and four are already in University and..blah..blah.”
*** 
“It is hard to educate the girl child in Nigeria”

“MY sister is educated, MY niece is educated, MY mother has a degree, MY boss has a PHD, I finished from Yales. It is not hard to educate the girl child in Nigeria.”
*** 
I do hope you know these are the arguments that keep us under-developed? 

The ability to turn every issue to a personal triumph is a big problem standing between the Nigerian and the next change.

We are narcissist to a point of dismay. Painfully self-absorbed, looking at the entire spectrum of life and living from tinted glasses.

If it is good at my end, and at the end of my friends, and at my neighbour’s end, and at the end of the woman I had a chat with on the bus… THEN it is good with the nation.

That is our stance, always. And that is why we have no leaders in this country. Because they will rule based on the experience of their mothers, sisters and in-laws; and the testimonies of cronies. 

It is a small wonder that you would speak to some governors and they will proudly proclaim they didn’t know that so-and-so inter-city routes are bad or prone to accidents. They don’t know, they don’t want to have that debate because they fly in private jets and their brothers fly first class and their secetaries fly business class. The debate is useless, they only want to live in the comfort of their experience.

We produce the leaders that we are.

We do not want to be ruffled by anything. Let us live with our own testimonies, our proofs.

Again, isn’t that why Buhari is all of a sudden the messiah?

-Because the average Nigerian would rather believe that, unfriend you hastily if you argue that point, than have a discussion that will throw up your very sad and myopic viewpoint.

When the only reason you think this man of such lofty status is because you do not wish for GEJ to come back and continue in his weakness...or in typical Nigerian attitude: because you have your "people" on a list of Buhari's hopeful government.

If you allow conversation to have substance, you will realise that life is bigger than the soup you cooked last night and the duvet you found yourself in this morning.

What establishes a human being as a Being is the ability to keep aside his/her comfortable/secure life and build cases around issues that affect the majority of people; the mass of unanswered questions.

But that is an aside. Christmas is here, isn’t it? And for those of us who can afford a good one, we go ahead and have a blady good one.

Oh! And just so our conscience remains unsullied, we bless a few motherless babies' homes with some crisp notes and nice clothes.

And the circle continues because, well, who has time for proper dissecting of issues, or proper beginning of actions? 

For the Nigerian, life is an “aside”. We prosper separately from the general problems slapping our (collective) faces.
