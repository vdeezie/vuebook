Nigerian women, relax.

When a man says ‘hello’, don’t let it rub off on both of you the wrong way.

The answer to ‘hello’ is NOT…“What is it? Mschhhhewwwww!”

Mba! That is not the right response.

Give him back what he gave you; a simple: ‘hello’. 

Men don’t bite.

How are we going to find and build great friendships if we keep treating every new face like a leper, ehn?!

Nigerian men, you too, relax!

When a woman is having lunch or dinner alone at a restaurant, and your eyes meet, and she is courteous enough to smile, and then for some reason you decide it will be harmless to join her, do not assume she wants to have sex with you- THAT NIGHT…or ever!

Haba!

Women are human beings, not body parts. They have cerebral needs, and might just want to strike up a conversation on, say, the evolution of the human species.

If you are confused about these things, relax and take a selfie.

Everything is gonna be aaaaalright!
