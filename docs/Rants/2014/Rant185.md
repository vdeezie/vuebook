I have been on set with someone who thought to ask an author... 

“So why is the cover of your book blue?”

On Live TV!

I was embarrassed, and ashamed. But it seemed I was the only one who had a problem with questions like that. The crew loved every bit of it, and viewers too must have seen my seeming frustration.

Trust Nigerians, the emails that were to follow were just… bleh!

“Joy is overshadowing X. Why don’t you pair him with someone on his level?”

“No actually, they should take X out and put an intelligent man by Joy’s side”

“Joy will just be looking at her nails whenever X is talking. Is that fair?”

“I like Joy’s dress today…”

“X needs to lose weight…”

“Please remember to powder Joy’s nose. It is always shinning…”

And then I read on one mumu website:

“Joy is always acting like she knows everything. She won’t even give X an opportunity to say anything. I think she needs to be curbed.”

A lone bitter comment at the grave yard LOL!

So why did I remember this today?
