I have the most profound respect for atheists; it must take a lot of courage to walk through this world without belief/faith beyond what you can see and feel and smell. 

It is heroic to rely on your own limits; to be content with a decrepit earth; or maybe not, but to believe that there is nothing beyond what we have as flesh- to live in this world flawed by human debauchery, tainted by pleasurable hate and mockery, deception, lies, the stench of malice buttered with kindness and compassion that comes only after sessions of foul gluttony, is almost, well, commendable. 

Really, you are the true valiant ones; courageously tearing through a war with a sword and no army. I salute you.

I wouldnâ€™t live a day without knowing God is, you know? I am cowardly like that. He has to be; if not, then this is not life. All this nonsense around us is shameful. To embrace this as the only life I would live would be not to live at all.

How can my life depend on the inadequacies that I am? How can life rest solely on what I see- this mess of our existence; of sheer stupidities and cruelty?

How can life be about dilapidated buildings, diseased children, poor parents, rich lousy pastors, idiotic politicians, bloody terrorists, dumb decisions?

What is the point to life if you will die of cancer in your 50s and leave an inheritance to someone who will die soon enough after a few years? And that is life? Faded jeans, plastic smiles, lean mattresses, trips to other countries to compare just how flawed we all are?

If this is life then what a life!

If the atheist needs help- a new job, perhaps; some money, a new lease to life, what does he do? Would he need to rely on another human being as damaged and selfish as he is? Heap your worry on the next man who finds the nearest bin to throw it in?

We are incapable of helping ourselves. What can I give you that you cannot attain on your own? Our limitations are pitiful.

We all want something; most times we want the same thing(s). What guarantees do you have that the next man will be kind enough to share what he has or give what he thinks you need?

To spend life resting on your strengths and the remnant of what the next person can throw your way is beggarly.

There has got to be a God bigger than all of what exist, and a life after now; because if this life is all I have then even in its brilliance, I am appalled.

This life cannot be all that exists. This cannot be all that I am.

This flesh that decays cannot be all that I would be. 

I cannot rely on man. What can man do for me? He too is in need of something beyond his reach.

There is a God. I pray to Him everyday. Actually, I am in conversation with Him almost every other minute. I take everything to Him because I just can't...I can't deal! 

He is the reason why everything works together for my good.

But I salute you atheist that you would have to constantly believe in man or yourself or your intellect/abilities, whatever it is you rely on through this drudgery called life without escape, is really what superman is made of.

Me? I need rest in the bosom of the Almighty.
