I don’t know how he does it, but this is such good writing.

I’ve never been to Afropolitan Vibes but I can feel the heat, inhale the smoke

It’s fast-paced and energetic

I am blinded by the excitement

Distracted by lustful stares

Carefree parade

All brought to life in this piece.

I am not a big fan of “live music”

I have done the whole Thursday Live at Swe Bar with my friend Seun Tall  

And I do a lot of Bheerhugz Live weekends…

That’s about it

But this sounds like fun

Like tapping your feet

Like a movie where the thrill leaves you gasping for air.

It’s happening this Friday.

You should be there.
