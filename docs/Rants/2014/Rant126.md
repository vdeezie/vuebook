When your kids win the awards for…

- Most Disciplined

- Most Punctual

- The Neatest students

Three years in a row…

It shows they’ve got great parents.

In this case, a great mother.

I am a great parent.

These awards are truly mine.

I will not feign "Nigerian humility" and begin to thank the trees, the stars and chickens around my neighbourhood for the hard work I put into training my kids as a single parent.

But I will thank my mother for always being there to take the burden off when it looks like it is going to kill me.

And God, yes. He is awesome like that.

Cheers!
