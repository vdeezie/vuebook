In Nigerian homes, you start talking the minute you wake up.

You would have spent the night talking to your late grandmother in your dreams

Then you wake up to talk some more to the living

Our lives, a mash of chaos; there's never a moment of silence.

Talk, that’s all we know.

One of the largest consumers in the world

Our mouths are always open- to eat, to curse, to pray, to shout.

We create nothing because we have no clue what it means to…Reflect. Think. Put the brain to good use.

The average middle-class home has six talkers in a two-bedroom apartment.

If you keep your mouth shut for 15 minutes, your mother will put her hand on your head:

“What is wrong? Are you sick? Why are you quiet?” in any of the 360 dialects.

We aim for happiness by talking
We grieve by talking
We show love by talking
We celebrate wealth by talking
Cry over poverty by talking

A friend loses her baby, for instance, and you pay her a visit with your mouth ready to fart. You pray and share the scripture, and try to talk about all the reasons this misfortune must have happened to her.

You need to shut up!

Silence is what she needs.

Silence.

But we don’t know what that means.

We are uncomfortable around silence. Silence would mean that we are not "connecting", we have little in common. "Talk" would mean we are cool.

When I meet up with friends, I try to act on silence. We don't have to talk when there's nothing to say. And sometimes, it's just not the right time to say anything. Why can't friendship thrive on silence?

I teach my children the art of silence

Take one hour in the day and say nothing; do not feel awkward about it

Just. Think.

If your relationships are judged by how many words you can spit per minute

That relationship needs to grow up

When does the brain get to work?

When do we get to shut up and live?
