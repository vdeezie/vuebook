Should I laugh, should I cry or should I slap someone?

I was visiting my mum jejely oh when one of her neighbours walked by…

“That woman was made to walk around the market, in the village, naked,” she said.

"Huh???”

Here’s the story:

Woman and man get married. After a few years together, man runs away with another woman for 8 years. Woman is left alone; in the fourth year without a husband, she starts a casual relationship with another man. Now their kids (kids with her runaway husband) are all grown up. One of them is “ripe” for marriage *yawn*. 

Family and villagers claim her 20-something year old daughter cannot get married because the mother committed abomination by sleeping with another man.

So if she is ever going to find a husband- this 20-something year old daughter, her mother has to walk around the village- naked. The aim is to bring dishonour to her actions (of dating a man while her husband was banging another woman), so her children can find honour through her repentance (more like Jesus who was nailed on the cross and cursed, so we can be, well, blessed) *coughs*

Here’s the interesting part: The 20-something year old daughter and her siblings thought it wise for their mother to take a leisurely walk around the villa with nothing on.

The 20-something year old daughter pleaded and cried and demanded that her mother do what must be done so she can, one day, find a husband.

They told her to do it.

And the woman did it.

I am looking at her from my mother’s balcony thinking…

What idiots, what bloody  idiots- the whole family.

Patriarchy has a face- it is the face of a foolish idiotic 20-something year old daughter and her all-round retarded family! All of them.
