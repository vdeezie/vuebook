My only regret, if death was to come knocking, would be…

Not reading Grabriel García Márquez’s “Love in the time of cholera”

Finally! I have felt like a cheat all these years

How do you call yourself a writer and have not "loved cholera"?

It’s like losing your virginity in your 30s

First page and someone is dead…

It doesn’t get any better than that.
