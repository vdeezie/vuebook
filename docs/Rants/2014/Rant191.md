Warning: Rant! Rant! Fart! Rant!

A woman killed her 3 year old son; beat the boy to death for reacting badly to the meal he had at a joint. She stuffed him in a bag and dumped him at the backyard of her sister’s house before calling the police to file a missing person report…

A woman, frustrated by her 9 year old house maid's bed-wetting, charged her to sit on a burning electric cooker…

Boko Haram is ripping Northern Nigeria apart. They have internet right there in the bush, information, weapons at their disposal. A few men terrorizing 160 million people with weapons that can be bought from neighbourhood stores in America…

Ebola has no cure; a disease that can end one’s life just by touching a door knob handled by a sufferer…

And for some reason I am supposed to care that YOU are upset and YOU will never forgive me and YOU are on a trip to reprisal.

These women sef, you still don’t get it, do you?

If a doctor tells me I am going to lose my legs today, I begin to plan a life without it

I don’t read bad “anything”, life is too short to waste on mediocre writing

I am upset because in all of 6 years I have not played chess, I don’t understand how there are so few players in Lagos and none in my life

I have never had to be with anyone because of what I can get from them. My relationships are strictly cerebral; and I will not judge anyone by the SUV they drive or the part of town they live. I am very proud of my short-sightedness to greed.

When it gets to a point where we have to attack each other I will use words that you will NEVER get over. Ever. I am that holistic with vituperations.

And I don’t care. You would have asked for it.

In the same circumstances I’ll do it again, and again.

My only regret in this world is being Nigerian (I would have gladly chosen to be a bird instead).

Having you as some bitter enemy in touch with her demons is a thrill, not a regret.

I’ve seen too many deaths in the past year; anybody can drop dead.

You think I’m going to spend this short life worrying about your ugly nose and your bitterness? 

I’m just an unrepentant writer with a lot of things on my mind…and I will say every single one of them before I go. If you are standing in my way with retorts and shit…please bake a cake with arsenic poison. You will most likely survive that than what will come out of my mouth… or in this case my keyboard.

And I don't do part two of any fight. That's giving you power. You hold none. I am the despot. I decide when your blood should turn black, how despicable your actions should get.

It is not my fault you have baby tantrum issues. Next time pick your battles wisely.

It is what it is.
