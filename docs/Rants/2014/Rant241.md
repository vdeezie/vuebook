October 1, 2014

The clothes, the food, the calls you receive, waiting for the bus, making a point, sitting at a reception for your turn, shopping at the mall, doing absolutely nothing, or ironing your underwear, deciding whether to fit the microwave on a stool or next to the cooking gas…

That is Life.

We are perpetually in a hurry for the next thing. We want to drop our kids off in school and hurry back so we can return to “other things”. But that moment- the kids holding your hand, swinging all the way to the car, the music you switch on, their little arguments that make no sense to you, the short drive, the annoying voices on radio, the see-you-later greetings, the "hello" you share with the teacher at the gate…

That is Life. No need to rush.

Enjoy it.

Pause and enjoy Life.

We are stuck in traffic, rushing to a meeting. We don’t see that life is playing out. 

The tapes are rolling.

Life doesn’t start when you get to that office and begin your meeting.

It continues from a train of other events you fail to recognize- the traffic, the book you read a day before, the short visit from friends…

The calls we are quick to end. The conversations we never conclude, because we have to do “something else”

That is Life- the things we leave hanging is called Life.

It never ends.

So pause and just enjoy the wait, as you stand on your balcony. Look around you and see what you can take in- the child trying to catch a grasshopper, the woman buying garden eggs, the noise from the other house, the laugher that you cannot trace.

Life is playing out every second.

We miss a lot of it. 

Today I spoke with my friend, Foluke. I was rushing out of the house to get pizza and ice-cream. I had a bag on one hand and was locking my door with the other. I wanted the call to be short because, typical of what we are, I had to rush and go do “something else.”

But then I paused.

Talking to Foluke Ibiteye IS Life. I am not going to gloss over this conversation or miss her calm breathing over the phone because I have to go do “something else”.

These are all the little things that come together to make it what it is- LIFE.

So I dropped my bag, rested on the railing on my balcony and had the conversation without thinking of anything else but that moment. Inhaling. Living it.

Because I will never be able to go back to 6pm October1, 2014 to live that moment again. I might never get to hear her voice in that texture, we may never have to revisit that issue again.

Some things are more important than others, but most things are not. It is all a medley of Life occurring.

Right now, I am tuned to E! and watching "botched". I want to watch something else, but I will enjoy the 5 minutes of Life I am dedicating to this crap; and then switch to another channel.
