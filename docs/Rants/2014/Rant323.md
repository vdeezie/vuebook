Nigerians…

You had no electricity 261 days out of 365

You spent 50 days in traffic out of 365

Your relationship is as average as a sandwich

You have the flattest relationship with your mother

Your salary can barely take you through 31 days. You’d rather not do that job at all

You fought with your neighbour, couldn’t really afford a weekend out without paying for it weeks later

You are with someone just because being alone scares you

Your heart skips when you think of school fees, rents and stuff

You are half the time worried about how the sham of Nigerian politics, lack of amenities, poor choices and zero opportunities will affect the next project you have

You made really shitty choices, rash decisions, judged too quickly, displayed your immaturity, insecurity, and constantly thinking from an angle that makes you almost retarded.

But you are Nigerian. And you must be thankful for 2014.

You are, after all, alive. 

Alive. What does that even matter? 

So who is sincere enough to say it as it is?

Something like: “2014 was average. I didn't live half the life I should have. It could have been better if only I made the best use of the options I had. Like, write that proposal and get that money for that project…Instead of spending all my time on social media, reliving high school."

-something sincere like that.
