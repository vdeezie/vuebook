The poor man on the issue of having more children than he can take care of:

"I am a man…you see…to born pikin is a good som'tin…

You see all these rish pipu eferywhere, they eat orisirisi Tantalizer and all dat kain food haff destroy their body and affect them from borning pikin... Me I eat fresh tins from farm...

God bless poor man to be able to knack him wife once and born plenty. That is the blessing of poor man…becos shidren is a good things…

That is why god put us on earth- to born pikin. E make him happy to see pipu born pikin. Pikin can nefer go out of fashion. It is a good som'tin to be borning...

Even oyinbo pipu cannot born plenty; they are under curse from heaven because they are not godly pipu enough for heavenly blessings so they haff just one or two and it is not enuf becos happiness of man is plenty shidren that will take care of him at old hage
