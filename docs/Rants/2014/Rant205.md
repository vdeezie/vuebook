You can’t help some guys of a certain age

I remember some skeletal PR service I rendered to one of those up-and-coming 20-something year old characters...

Every time I headed back home after a meeting, I’ll get online and find out he tweeted stuff about me…

For instance:

“Girls in jeggings be working on some nice ass…”

I would have had jeggings on.

OR

“A lot of body oil on black skin tho…like you can see the sun on some women’s skin…”

I would have used Bio Oli or Neutorgena body Oil

It was so awkward.

At a certain age, that resounding immaturity cannot be helped.

Not a sweeping statement…they are always exceptions; but you get my drift.
