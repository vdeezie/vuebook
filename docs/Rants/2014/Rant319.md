5 things...

I’ll like to thank…

IfooAfrica for making this the best year of a woman’s career. Thank you.

To friends like Bunmi Adeleye and Seun (Tall) Akinbohun who support my projects and ideas financially. Seun has been doing this for years. It’s amazing. Yet no disagreements, no disrespect, just love and understanding. Thank you, babe.

My mother; for without her I wouldn’t be able to dream at all. She takes all my domestic burden on her shoulder so I can be alone or with my laptop and cook up ideas and run with them. She’s not on Facebook, but…yea.

To Karo Agono, Stephanie Okereke Linus, Sola Kuti, Aunty Teresa Oyibo, and most recently Omoni Oboli. You’ve all been good to me.

And to friends like Funke Tega Phillips who will not let me rest: “Joy, you can have your pick of any man oh! Just point and the dude will come running.” LOL! Na so.

And of course, Prisca, who has suffered every relaxer burn on my scalp with me. 

LMAO!
