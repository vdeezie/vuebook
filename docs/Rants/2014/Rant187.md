Hallo all

So I am about to pour a bucket of water on my bodi

In the bafroom

To support #ALS

So that efrybodi can support #ALS

It is a wonderful som’tin, you see

We get to baff and at the same time support a cause

So I am nominating three pipu

To pour bucket of water on their bodi

Foluke Ibiteye, Yemisi Sawyer, and that hot bodi boo- Folarin Flo

Remove ya cloth and be naked…

Pour bucket of water

Take pishure and send to Facebook

For all of us to approve your support of #ALS

Forget your own troubles and immediate diseases

America will help us with poverty and BokoHaram…

And the kidnapped girls and boys...

Cholera, polio and malaria...

Ebola!

Forget them all

Pour water NOW!

Be part of this... Amazingly Lazy Saturday 

That is the meaning, is it not?

Toh!
