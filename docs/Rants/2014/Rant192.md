In light of what Tope Fasua wrote about Africans and business, let me throw in my own pedestrian observation:

A Nigerian man produces wine, for instance. He is coming from London, after 13 years. He has a degree and has worked in a wine company. He wants to recreate the magic in his homeland- Nigeria.

He opens a chic liquor store in Ikoyi where he sells his own production alongside world renowned alcoholic beverages.

He has only 9 samples of his wine. Let’s call it Swazz Posh alcoholic wine (something with a name we cannot pronounce and does not reflect its Nigerian pedigree).

So Swazz Posh alcoholic wine it is!

Cosmopolitan Nigeria will not let the man rest. They are already thrusting a camera and microphone in his face. 

The OAPs and their “R”s will line up in his store for interviews; he will be featured in magazines, tabloids and blogs. He’ll be forced to hold an “opening party”- red carpet style; websites will dedicate a whole weekend covering the red carpet shenanigan.

He’ll be approached for AD space in glossy magazines, and will have many red carpet invites on his table- from dinner with the Island babes, to hanging out with the stars; irrelevant bullshit that a business man shouldn’t be bothered about. 

Wherever he appears he’ll be photographed and these photos get robust connotations on blogs with interesting captions:

“First Nigerian indigenous wine producer chilling with strange girl at a bar…”

He will be invited to give lengthy speeches at Youth conferences/events on: “How to grow indigenous businesses.”

He will be nominated for awards from North to South. If he is below 35…AH!!! He is finished! All the youths in Nigeria will crowd his inbox and message box on social media with every request known to man:

“We are celebrating the 30-going-on-18 party for successful Nigerians and would like you to be our special guest”

BUT… this guy is NOT yet successful; this guy has only 9 samples of  his freaking wine; with most of the work made in France!!! He needs air, he needs space to think, to plan, to invest, to grow.

“Island Nigerians” will not let a business man hone his business skills before they throw him out in the wild with naked boobs all over his face and corporate handshakes from everywhere!

He is made a celebrity before his time. He starts to worry about the colour of his tie, quality of his cufflinks, the kind of car he drives, when he should be comfortable to strut around in pyjamas (like Zuckerberg) and drive a Honda saloon!

He enjoys this idiotic Lagos/Abuja celebrity lifestyle too much he loses focus, and spends his investments on Banana Island houses and a yacht; frolicking with Rihanna-looking Island girls with high style.

*sighs*

A year later, with only a few unreasonably priced bottles of wine to his name; exhausted from all the cameras and sex, he returns to London to get a job at Xerox.
***
On the other side of the Nigerian ridiculousness… he is frustrated by government levies, custom briberies and legendary Nigerian time-wasting mechanisms at every point of business. He is distraught, confused and lacking morale at this point.

Either way, we know how to make a business idea die a sad and disgraceful death, putrid in all its undignified glory.
