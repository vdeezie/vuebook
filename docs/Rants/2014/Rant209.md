Being Mrs Elliot is a sweet love story with pretty twists of affection

Crisp picture, hilarious, genuine, witty, worth every pop of corn that crushes between molars

They found love in the most unlikely places… with a bit of suspicion and a lot of faith.

Every actor came alive- Majid, AY Makun, Lepacious Bose, Uru Eke, and the amazing/creative Omoni Oboli

Prisca and I had fun and drinks, and she smoked into my hair… 

She wouldn’t keep quiet- she is dating some new guy, and rapped on about him

And the dude… he called her more than ten times in an outing that lasted barely 4 hours

“How’s it going, baby?” I could hear him

Then he’d call again…and again…

“Tell him I don’t have a penis.” 

*roll eyes*

:D
