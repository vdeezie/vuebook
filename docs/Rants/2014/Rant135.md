Every once in a while, I remember this:

A few years back, I was having drinks with a friend, male, at the restaurant of one of those fancy hotels.

A Nigerian man walked in with his white woman

He pulled out a chair for her to sit

They were having conversation, he was attentive, looking into her eyes.

He was holding her hands, pulling strands of invisible hair from her face

She stood up to use the restroom, he helped her with the chair- again.

They headed to the pool, he had his hands around her neck, kissing her head, rubbing her back.

A Nigerian male in the presence of other Nigerians...

Unashamed of this shameful thing called Love.

My partner turned to me and said:

“You know, if she was black, he would have a different approach to loving her. Because this practice is something they reserve for other races.”
