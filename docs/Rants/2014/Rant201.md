Atheists are the new Christians 

Like Christians, they are volatile with their own gospel of a non-existing God

All you need do is mention your beliefs, and they’ll pounce on you with pseudo-intellect, pooping in your cup, defying your liberty

Like Christians, they gather on one thread spewing blasphemy, hailing their sense of modern cerebral accomplishments in regards to the stupidity of other religion

Because this too is a religion- a religion that is just as self-absorbed as any other; trying to sell its own points, package its own ideals, build its own cult

You are almost afraid to be spiritually inclined in your own space without some shithead atheist, feeling like the smartest shit in the pond, trying to play down your love for God…

Just like Christians would do, throw their religion right in your face with such annoying rhetoric

You have become the monster you are trying to kill, dear atheists

This need to make everybody else inferior as regards to your dogma

You need to stroll right back into that hole you came out from and stay there

Channel your sarcasm to the right quarters

I do not tolerate inane comments from both Christians and Atheists, as they are all part of a bigger problem

If you believe in God, fine. Do not try to teach me how to love Him or connect with Him

And if you don’t believe in God, brilliant! BUT do not come around my bend and try to play-down or mock my beliefs...or throw in some cute catch-phrases that makes you think of yourself as progressive

You are not progressive...

And as a matter of fact, I do believe you could do with some God in your empty soul, and some Hallelujah in your strides...

But that is none of my business.
