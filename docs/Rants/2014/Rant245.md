Yesterday, I was walking out of the bathroom and into Melting Moments to get cupcakes when I heard a boy behind me say to his friends…

“Damn, she’s got nice legs. I’m going to tell her.”

You would have to speak above the hundreds of other sounds/voices in a busy mall for your friends to hear you, like in a club; so he may have thought he was whispering but it was loud enough for me to catch.

I went into Melting Moments, they- three of them, followed but took a table at the corner.

I came out five minutes later, looking for Prisca whom I had left in the bathroom; and he stepped up to me:

“Hello, sorry, I just wanted to say you have nice…EYES.”

LOOOL!

I guess it’s more appropriate to pay compliments to a Big Auntie’s eyes and not her legs.

Something very sexual about legs.

The boy was barely 20.

I like his confidence.

If he can channel it to other more constructive/valuable pursuits, he’ll be good.

The annoying nervousness and timidity of the average African child gets on my nerves anyway.
