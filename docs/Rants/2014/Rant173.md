Dear Nigerians, living in a country like ours is synonymous to living with abusive parents- no love, no forgiveness, no care, cruelty, no progress...

You need a hug every day, Nigerian. A tight hug, good sex, positive faith; someone to love you... a chance to give a little of yourself to love.

So stop acting like you are some tough shit. 

You are Nigerian, you have no water, no roads, no education, no food, no health care, bloody evil pastors parading as solution to all your problems- you have nothing; you ain’t shit.

So now, exhale… 

Cry some, relax and embrace the people who accept you.

The world is against you. Everywhere you turn, the green passport is a curse...

Even in your own country. You are flung into avoidable lack because nothing works- nothing! Your leaders intentionally run you down and take the little you have; leaving you stark and needy. 

Now, think! How do you then turn against the miniscule number who care, who want to share a piece of their own love cake with you?

Bring those tired shoulders down.

Hold on to what you've got. 

It's a cold cold world out there.
