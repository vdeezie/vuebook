October 13, 2014

Today started with a tee shirt and a knotted black bead around my neck; blue jeans and sunglasses, curly punk and red lipstick.

First, I dashed to Colonades Hotel to pay for venue and refreshments for the upcoming New Lagos Book Club dialogue session, “The Business of Writing”.

They treated me like royalty. 

So I decided what da heck, I should pay for a room to stay on Friday night- the eve of the event, so I get to wake up fresh without any morning pressure.

Then I spent the whole day and a minute with the amazing Omoni Oboli at her home. She cooks the meanest everything! And so I ate the most delicious jollof rice and chicken I have ever had! 

Her culinary skills shame everything I have ever done in my kitchen.

Evening came soon, then I had to travel back to my ‘hood. 

Traffic. Earphones on. Music. A/C. Perfect.

A few text messages. Writers registering for “The Business of Writing" (131 registered writers and counting...)

Then at 8.01pm SHARP, as far as my watch went, I got a call...

“Hello…”

Make your wildest guess!

Not Leonardo DiCaprio, silly!

It was DEMOLA ADEDOYIN!!!

What? You don’t know? Ah!

Yesterday I ended my post with: *dials the-hot-dude-in-October-1-for-a-drink*

Today, the hottest actor in town, Mr. October 1… aka Prince Aderopo... aka we-can-share-a-drink-under-the-sunset… aka damn-yo-I’ll-keep-you-safe-like-a-flash-drive… Called Me!!!

“Hello, this is Demola Adedoyin…”

1-2-3…

“Oh My God! It is you! Prince Ropo…”

“How are you, Joy…”

And the rest of the story stays with me, the prince, and the gods.

Long live the Republic of Joy.
