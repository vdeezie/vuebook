"I pioneered indigenous rap music and today it has become lucrative and fashionable. Yet, these young musicians shy away from that fact. They try to hide it... But I deserve an award, recognition and endorsement because a lot of people look up to me as their mentor. Look at Eedris Abdulkareem and 9ice, for instance. Iâ€™m saying they should take care of the pioneers, but what impact have these new artistes really made in the society to deserve all the endorsements they are getting? I mean, they sing nonsense songs while we (pioneers) do evergreen and clean music. Yet they keep discouraging us.
I left the music scene after I got married in 2009 to delve into other businesses. I started this movement long before these small boys emerged on the scene and I paved the way for many of them... while 9ice and Olamide were following my footsteps..." - Lord of Ajasa (Punch)

We should never get to a point where we can clearly express our bitterness the way we think it. Such despondency and desperate surrender. That we get married and throw our years and talent in the bin should not be the other-man's fault or headache. 

That we quit while the sun is up and relinquish our dreams based on other choices we make (in this case, marriage), remains your problem, your sacrifice. And the bitterness, a sad consequence.

I use to love his music; when he paired with Too Phat on a track it was close to magic. There's still room for his kind. But to give expression to those irresponsible thoughts, and claims of entitlement take away from the remnant that is left of his worth as a musician.
