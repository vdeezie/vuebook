What do you think about gays?

“Actually, it’s bad in our country. It’s not right; God has made it a man to woman, not a man to man or woman to woman. It’s very wrong, just like its meant to be a negative to positive not positive to positive or a negative to negative, it’s quite bad, I don’t think it’s cool…” – Mr. Universe Nigeria

This is the kind of drivel you get in a society where you win N8m + an SUV for music reality contests for instance, and have meagre N100k prizes for writing/essay competitions.

The crop of disaster we rear, unable to EXPRESS their thoughts intelligently and persuasively; or have any kind of sensible opinion for that matter!

With brains perpetually dry humping.

When we excuse the shoddiness of unintelligence continuously with fame or money as convenient tools of vindication, this is what you get- these shitty responses to everything.

What do you think of feminism?
“I think it is the thing of the devil and it is not of God at all because God say that woman should be helpmeet. It is not good. It is a western thing and it is not good. It is not cool at all.”

What do you think about, let’s see, Ebola?
“It’s not good at all. And government has to do something because it’s just not good- at all. And Obama has to give us the medicine to help us and we have to continue to demand for it. God will definitely come to our aid because Nigeria is a great country. It is uncool.”

The convenience of morals and religion; that they shield you from developing anything that looks remotely like a brain.

Passion. What is life without it? You can hate gays, you can hate feminists, you can believe Obama owes you something, but please say it...say it with an impressive dose of passion and nous and spark.

Ah!
