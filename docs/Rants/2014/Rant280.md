# Rant279


November 10, 2014

Last week, I called my mum. Her usual cheery voice was damp and in need of sunshine.

She had backache, headache, nausea, slightly feverish, all of those symptoms that attack you like hunger.

I decided I would take her by the hand and drive her to the hospital where she can reel it out to a doctor and get all the necessary tests and medication. I have to do this you see, because my darling mother is addicted to self-medication. No fault of hers, as I remember as a teenager she grumbled incessantly about the fees and the distance and hours she had to spend before she could see a specialist- especially the distance.

One day she came home from an appointment at the Hospital by 11.25pm. And we joked that at this rate death could arrive faster with these trips along danger zones, like Orile, by midnight.

This morning, my kids started with a list of everything imaginable:

“My teacher says I should buy another tie. This one’s hook is bad.” 
(A freaking school tie costs N3,500! That’s the kind of money some homes use to make a pot of soup.)

“Mummy, will you pay for the excursion to Ghana? My friends are going.” 
(In this Ebola/terrorist/political plagued period? Over my dead body.)

“Mummy ballet classes start next week. Can I join? Here’s the invoice.” 
(To step on your toes with one hand in the air and the other pointing at the middle of your head is going to cost me something that can put me in Protea Hotel for the weekend to write half-a-book? Mba!)

And it dawned on me: this is the phase where all you do is care for others. 

Who cares for you?

I tried having a conversation with my mum a few weeks back about the emotional drag that life can be and how depressing it gets sometimes. She shook her head vigorously and said:

“You? Depressed? How? You can’t be depressed. You are not even structured in that way. Look at you- see how far you’ve come; see how much you are doing? See how hectic and exciting your life is! You do whatever you want! I didn’t have the guts or the fight to question society like you do; to break the rules like you. But see you! You are like a moving train.  See how well your kids are. Do you know your kids do not have an ounce of greed in them; they are impressive snubs- just like you. They have everything. You have given them everything so much that they have lost the excitement for the random things that make children do a somersault. Depressed? You just need a good lover, that is all. That is not depression, that is your body in need of good loving. It will come.”

And with that we settled to a hot pack of pizza and ice cream.

I appreciate that she thinks so well of me. But I was really, well, emotional miserable at the time; and that super human anthem was just what it was, an anthem.

Nobody knows when I have a headache. When I have backache. When I need to be in bed all day because I am overwhelmed with life as it were. Nobody knows because I am at that phase where you become the spring they need to drink from.

What about me?

If the water dries, they will move on- even kids. It’s nothing to be angry about. That is life. Life is designed to move regardless of how important you think you are.

So I make no apologies for my lavish weekends. I have very colourful weekends, and it is intentional.

Even my romance with the idea of death, which is far from suicidal, is a method to feel my skin. 

Am I still alive? 

Hello, my knee hurts. Can you hear me?

Anybody there?!

Last month I had this sharp pain that built a home around my waist. It stayed for three days. I would rest on kitchen lockers for minutes until the pain left. My kids were, of course, watching ‘Sophia the First’, unaware of the pain that I wouldn’t even share with them.

It’s a scary phase of being alone, but not lonely. Of many friends, but only a few. Of compliments and praises, but not deep enough to reach the soul.

It is a confusing phase. You are careful who to let in, who to walk away from. Your thoughts are deeper, your ego slaked. You are submissive to your feelings, your emotions. And you would eat the shit you wouldn’t even bring yourself to smell a couple of years back.

It is nothing to be ashamed of. 

You have matured. A little tweaking here and there and you’ll find the formula that truly works for you. You have come of age.

And nobody has a right to question who or how you choose to spend the rest of your days.
