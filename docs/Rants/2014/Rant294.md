Just before I unfriend all the atheists on my list, let me give you something for your beer parlour god-bashing sessions, something uncool to jeer about.

This year was a tough year, the toughest.

I suffered alone- emotionally, financially; my health failed me one time, many times.

I was alone.

No one to talk to. No one who cared. I wouldn’t burden my mother because she had her own many issues to deal with.

So I carried my pain and fears.

I wouldn’t have my kids around for fear that I would just burst out in tears and startle them, threaten their peace of mind.

I cried alone. I lived alone. Days I wouldn’t even stand up from my bed. All day.

I stopped eating. I just stopped living.

I wanted the world to stop too.

But it didn’t.

And in my aloneness and the walls caving in…

I spoke to God.

I had this long conversation about everything that has killed my spirit.

*And here’s the good part (this is where atheists should click their glasses, guffaw and shake their heads and mutter, “stupid", stupid)

God touched me. 

I could feel His arms around me. I closed my eyes and I let Him hold me.

His peace surrounded me. His Word came to me. His Love soothe.

I don’t have anybody except God.

People come and go with good and bad intents.

God remains. 

I choose Him every day. I choose Him over everybody and everything.

I wake up and I renew my love for Him.

He is all that I have. And it is enough.

And if you love someone, you don’t watch people ridicule him/her and yet keep them (mockers) in your life.

Your show of love is in the action you take.

If you disrespect God then you cannot be my friend.

You don’t know my pain, why should I choose you?
