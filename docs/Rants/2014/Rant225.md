# Rant225


September 18, 2014

Two years ago (and I don’t know what I was thinking), I agreed to write for one particular website. 

After my first article was published and comments followed, I knew I was in the wrong house. My writing was like offering marijuana in place of ice-cream for dessert.

The next week, I sent in my second piece and the editor called.

Editor: Hey Joy, we can’t publish this.

Joy: Ok

Editor: It is one-sided

Joy: It is my opinion

Editor: Yes, but it is one-sided

Joy: What exactly does that mean? I am a columnist, I write my opinion.

Editor: I mean… it doesn’t give solutions. We want you to look at the topic from different angles

Joy: Why should I? I’m not an expert on any matter; I am a writer addressing the matter from my point of view

Editor: We would appreciate if the article states a problem and solves the problem or give some advice

Joy: Yes, like aunties who barge into people’s homes and start giving the children advice, abi?

Editor: Well, yes. We would like your articles to help people find solution to their issues. We want them to look up to you for solution

Joy: I’m sorry but I can’t even find solutions to my own issues; I am not going to pretend I know the answer to anything; and I really don’t want people looking up to me. It is not my responsibility to fix or give them a shot of ecstasy.

Editor: We really wish you could

Joy: No I can’t. And I won’t.

I am a satirist. I am going to paint the ugliest, sweetest, most profound, disturbing picture of life that will get you talking, angry or mad. And I will leave you that way- go figure your issues and how you fit into the picture by yourself. 

I don’t have the answers to why these things happen. I might have a few ideas, but those are personal thoughts and I will not sell them like I am some expert.

So we decided, since I wasn’t going to pretend to have the answer to all the problems in the world, I couldn’t hold a column.

Thank God. I went back to drinking my tea.

That is the problem with Nigerian online platforms. Everyone is an expert on something.

A graduate struts out of school and begins to parade himself as a peak performance coach. He has never held a job, never ran a business, but he gets a column on a website and starts a long line of drivel that no one reads or remembers.

Once in a while s/he is blessed with one or two comments:

“Nice one. Kip it up.”

And so he “kips it up”, dishing a roll of toilet paper advice from sex, to relationships, to careers to fashion to religion to parenting- he is the writer with the solution to every problem.

A complete bore.

They will tell you what your body count should be as a woman; advise you on what you should do when you have four girls and no boy child; teach you how to keep your guy yearning, how to flirt successfully, how to be a better Christian than your neighbour, how to win your woman back, how to…how not to…

I don’t read anything that tries to advise me. I don’t like authority figures of any kind; I am a Partnership kind of person. 

You are not my head, I have my own head; and by God, I am not your tail. I find it unbearable to read people’s "advice" parceled like a box of chocolate; and they expect you to squeal like fat people do over a bar of Twix.

Satirists are like drunks really, they are going to say all the things that would rather not be said in that cocky manner.

I write for a very confident crowd; liberal and self-made. 

I can’t teach you how to tie your scarf around your head every morning, but I can tell you if it is an ugly-ass scarf... or a pretty one.

:D.
