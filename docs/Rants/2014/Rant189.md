Human cruelty in Nigeria has many moving parts. We have had years to evolve to this point of burning vaginas of maids. It used to be pepper or hot water on their feet, or beatings that would leave them sore for days, or insults of their unborn children.

Now we instruct them to sit and get their buttocks fried to a burst of blisters.

This tragedy usually starts with a woman who thinks little of herself; poor education, scampering with thousands of her kind to please and impress society, hoping to establish a crucial fact that she is fertile, like a land free of locust and erosion. 

But what to do with all these children now; sometimes like a swarm of bees with financial sting to your lean purse? Alas! There’s no money to care for the experiments of fertility. Not that there was ever money at any time; giving birth is just a convenient fuck sport. Whatever comes out of it is the reward- the battalion you now have pulling at your breasts trying to suckle blood are the rewards for making good use of your god-given reproductive organs.

Barely 10 and never been near a school, one of these try-outs, preferably female, is sent to a home in the city, where word has it that chicken is made for breakfast. Even if she gets to eat the bones only, she’d be in the city to make money that would be sent home to feed the family.

Now this madam she lives with pays a monthly fee and so believes she has a slave. She is the first to wake up, the last to go to bed; she cradles the baby moving back and forth a long corridor for hours until she gives into fatigue. Baby almost falls off her hands, baby cries, you show up from within your comfy walls, irritated by your slaves inability to shut your new born so you can go back to TeleMundo. 

She is paid to love your baby, care for your baby, feed your baby, serve your baby…paid to wash, clean, scrub, polish, wipe, dry, pat, repair...

But she is also just a baby- she farts in front of guests, eats with her mouth open, stands on the toilet seat, sings loud and annoying songs, can be very untidy, lacks proper hygiene…and urinates in bed.

For all her shortcomings... for your inability to love a child that is not connected to you by blood... you decide a hot electric cooker will teach the vital lessons?

It's amazing that while we are busy condemning spousal abuse; some of these wives/women are breaking grounds with excellent scores of violence beyond what any husband can conceive.

Or have you heard of men/husbands boiling their wives vaginas with electric cooker?

PS: Facebook won't let me post the link, but its on Linda's blog: "See what a lady did to her housemaid."

The pain that young girl must be going through... and a mother, beyond the witch of a madam, that I will never forgive.
