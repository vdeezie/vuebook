I don’t understand the concept of “extended relatives” and the weighty reputation it seems to hold in Nigeria.

Most of these uncles and aunts and cousins, away from familial sentiments, mean absolutely nothing to us. They were not part of our growing-up, do not contribute to our welfare, do not play any significant role in our lives (until the moment when they probably see your name in the papers with a congratulatory headline for winning a multi-million naira project, or just realise their “small niece” is headlining a TV show etc).

Extended relatives are as casual as the random friendships we make sometimes, a word we pick up from a sermon on radio, or an interview we read that meant something. Flippant and passing at best.

So when an “extended relative” calls me and goes on happily:

“Isiiiiiii. Hiyaaaaa! What’s good nah?! I’m getting married oh. And I would really like you to contribute to my wedding. My husband-to-be is only a primary school teacher, not much is happening from his side; so I need your support.” 

*The last time we met, I was 13 and she was 15*

It comes first as a text message. No name to support the request, so I blank it out…like I blank 99.9 issues of life.

Then she calls, and recites the same chorus again.

The first time I said, “Ok.”

The second time, I lost it.

“XXX, do you know the names of my children?”

“Huh?”

“I ask, do you know the names of my kids?”

“Errr…well…I think one is Cecilia…”

“Wrong.”

“Do you know what I do for a living?”

“Oh but I see you on TV!”

“Have you ever called to ask about my kids? If they need a cardigan? A book? How I am faring as a single parent?”

“I’m sorry, where is this discussion leading to?”

“You have no right to call me and ask me to contribute money for your wedding. If your fiancé is broke on arrival, it shouldn’t be my problem.”

“But…we are family…”

“Yes, when it is convenient for you.”

When someone dies, “extended relatives” are there to harass the surviving parent; take what is left from them, drag their sorrow and dignity in the mud.

I read somewhere that sexual abuse of children (male and female) occurs within the family circle, mainly by Uncles.

As far as I am concerned, extended relatives should stay that way- extended. A widened gap between me and their (selfish) needs.

I choose friendship over “extended whatevers.”

Friends have seen me through tough times

Friends have saved me from financial woes

Friends have been there to support my dreams and projects

I have been consoled, loved and accepted by friends.

And then of course, there's real family. And for me it is a very closely knit one. I will take a bullet for my mother, brother...and maybe my father, yes. And that's it.

Extended relatives…hmm! Some aunty’s half-sister’s niece comes to town and then the whole village starts to harass you to lodge her in your house. You have met this your aunt only once- when you were 10 years old and your father was threatening to throw your mum out. She was there to ensure your mum buys the required cow as a symbol of submission and reconciliation.

I hear that kind of story all the time 

Now you are being coerced by these people to accommodate one-of-them. The answer should be obvious.

It is not vindictiveness, it is common sense.
