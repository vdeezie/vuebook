# Rant115

It is the small and perennial issues that are more pressing…like the details I take into consideration before accepting a friend request:

If you take a bare-chested picture of yourself with woozy eyes in bed, hair on your chest as your profile picture…I will not accept your friend request.

If you talk religion from a simplistic point of view- quoting scriptures, unsophisticated tirade, ranting like the 5am evangelist that robs me of extra minutes of sleep, you will remain in line forever.

If you are an upcoming musician and I see that you are hitting 40 in a few days, hopping up and down from one photo-shoot to the other, uploading ghen-ghen poses like iron man and waiting for comments to validate your celebrity status, your game is played out, we have nothing in common.

If you are male and in any polytechnic in Nigeria, I am sorry I discriminate. Forgive me, I know there are exceptions…but I am traumatized by it all.  

If you are an unrelenting feminist-bashing noisemaker or you patronize women with your updates…why would you want to enter my den?

If we do not have mutual friends, of a certain caliber, in common; people whose opinions resonate with mine…nah!

If you wear horrible makeup and you are unaware of this…sharp eyebrow curved like a fish hook, bad weaves, and ghostly foundation….no, please stay away!

If you post a picture of yourself and title it: "pretty sexy sassy me". LOL! I’m sorry.

If you write like you sold all your vowels to the devil: “plz cn w tlk nw”, I do not consider you fit for “friendship”.

If you are the CEO of God is Good Enterprise (clearing and forwarding Halleluyah centre)…nah! Just leave me alone.

I just accepted someone's request after reading his latest (original) update:

"Newer versions of the Bible dilute its Poetry..."

Refreshing. I like.
