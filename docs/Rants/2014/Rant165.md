There’s this show on BET…this show…

Black is Power award... or something like that

Black women with turbans, natural hair and extensions winning all kinds of community awards...  

While women-in-weaves sit in the audience waiting for the ground to open and swallow them for not yet being genius enough to understand that nappy hair is the road to freedom...

The black man in suit feigning support, hoping the shit will end soon so he can return to his all-white crib and the Caucasian waiting patiently in his bed. 

And there's a white face in a pool of black, trying to connect with all the...err...hakuna-matata, blinking and nodding and sighing and wanting a glass of water.

These Black-is-Power awardees hold the audience hostage, they seize the mic for another 30 minutes, rant about acceptance and black beauty and what-I-did-to-that-white-person-who-looked-down-on-me-cos-of-my-fabulous-black-skin

They go on and on… And with tact, they ALWAYS get to weave in the black-man-hurt-me-when-he-left-me-for-the-straight-haired-white-waitress-down-the-street!

Then they start to cry, they want a revolution! 

Their weight wants a revolution! 

Their skin colour wants a revolution! 

Their hair needs a freaking revolution!

Me? I want to grab a pack of popcorn because I am amused by it all

This pity-party blacks put up every time they need to fight the urge to bleach their skins or wear a weave…with resentment as after-taste.

Biko, relax.

Be Calm and rub Vaseline.
