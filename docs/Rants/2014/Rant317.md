Last week, a friend launched her lingerie collection (she beat me to it!). 

For whatever reason, she decided to hire her Ex as the MC for the event (he is actually good and he came at a very reduced price)…

But that is not the weird part.

In the audience behind us (me, her and Prisca) was her Ex’s new babe.

She was sitting right there a few seats away, at her boyfriend’s Ex’s lingerie event!!!

She (new babe) sat through all the accolades showered on her (Ex’s babe) effort and creativity and through all the laughter and praises of people/friends who had something to say about her work.

She sat, like a fucking mannequin.

I don’t understand that- at all!

What the hell are you doing in your boyfriend’s Ex’s event?

Are you an imbecile or just a drama queen…like, you lost your way and got hit by a truck???

Have you no shame, no decorum???

How low can we get? As in…how does that even make any sense?!

It’s like going through her faeces, looking for something and then you hit a hard object…and it’s gold.

“Shit! She shits gold!”

Yes, bitch! Pure gold!

Now go on and go get a life.

Oh and it gets even weirder; gist got back to us that she said: “The event was bleh” (Lagos is a small place, people always forget that)

Of course. Now try creating something of your own.

This is quite the trend these days. 

Seriously, it is social media that is causing the mental deficiency in many people.  

2014 just go already with all your shocking distasteful revelations! Gosh!
