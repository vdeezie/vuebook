"Nigerians spend N602.6 billion on airtime in 5 months"

That is shitload of money! 

Ha!

Some people are getting paid, while the rest of us worry about…

"She said that my family looks like orangutans, I will never forgive her..."

"He left me, now I will never be the same again..."

"What did he say about the Caine prize?! Let me respond with a robust answer, cleverly written like nothing he'd have ever read!"

"I am trying to have a boy child, Lord answer me so my leg can be firm in my matrimonial home..."

"This Joy…this Joy…I hate her! Can’t she just shut up and be like everybody else? Hate her, hate her!"

"All my boys are buying expensive engagement rings for their women, let me add “engaged” to my FB page and get a fine ring for bae too..."

"Ah! I got 35 re-tweets on my last tweet. I’m the boss."

We all need to repent from our pathetic grudges, shocking small-mindedness and of repugnant poverty- of the mind and of the wallet.

All this money hovering above our heads, and all we do is worry about people's utterances, idiocies and shallow conclusions?!
