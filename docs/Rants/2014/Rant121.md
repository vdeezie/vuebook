Changes…

It’s no longer a Breakfast Show, it's a Lifestyle Show

It doesn’t air at 7am, it’ll start by 12.30pm-2pm

It's not a daily show, It comes on your screen Tuesdays and Thursdays

It is not recorded, it is LIVE baby!

I do not have a co-host, I anchor the show (and an out-and-about reporter joins me in the last 30 minutes for the Glitterati segment)

And this here, is my couch.

A few props are missing, but the interior and set designers are working round the clock.

We will be on your screen in another fortnight.

It’s the New Day Magazine Show on NTA Lagos... with the widest reach :)

*Rehearsals in a bit. 

Ciao!
