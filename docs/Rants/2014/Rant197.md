When they asked Dennis, Nurse Justina’s fiancé, how he survived Ebola, this was what he had to say:

"I was reading a book on healing and taking of the Holy Communion. So I learnt to take Holy Communion morning, afternoon and night. I also engaged myself in feet-washing every day before going to bed. The Almighty God saved me; the Holy Spirit healed me. It wasn’t as though l didn’t fall sick as l  had direct contact with Justina but the Almighty God healed me. When I was discharged, I got to my house on Saturday evening and spent two hours the next day, Sunday, thanking God on my own. I didn’t go to church or anywhere because of the already established stigma but today I can confidently attend church activities because I guess they all know I’m free now. I know my faith and belief healed me. God also worked for me apart from the fact that my immune system is also working. I believe I got healed also because friends prayed for me" he said.

I believe in God. There is a God and no one can convince me otherwise (so don’t even try). This is not a post to deride God, as I find those attempts not only reckless in all its blasé wit, but also unnecessary.

But THIS right here is why Africa remains under-developed and without a future with any promise.

We are in dire times, people need answers. When we ask questions or google: HOW DID YOU SURVIVE EBOLA, the results should not sound like Dennis! 

God has no favourites. As hard as it is for us to believe this, He has no favourites; and if we insist He does then He is not God. The sun shines on us all, we all have 24 hours, we all have opportunities. There are laws that govern the world; principles that shape our lives.

The earth is not heaven, and we are not promised a fun ride on earth… because, well, there’s good, there’s ugly and there’s outright evil in this world.

It is unfair to excuse yourself with religion. I do not lay blame on Dennis, I can only understand how emotional he is at this point… how grateful.

But we need practical answers; because if we continue to use God for every victory we have and for every downfall the next person suffers then…something is wrong with what we are worshipping.

A former school mate buried his wife today. He used to be a pastor in school. His wife, a young woman, barely in her 30s died at childbirth. And I have a neighbour who is at present a new mum, nursing her own baby.

Would it be fair to bring God into this picture? That He saved one and allowed the other to die?

That we fall under hard luck or bad luck is beyond serving God. People die every day for all the sad reasons…

We need answers, physical/tangible answers in a physical world.

To read about someone who survived this irresponsible disease and be taunted by his sermon of being saved by God makes his god unfair… and creates even more confusion in a society already raped by crass religion.

HOW DID DENNIS SURVIVE EBOLA after taking care of his fiancée hands-on with full blown Ebola; how?

No holy communion mumbo jumbo...

We need practical medical answers, please!
