If I didn’t have kids, I’d be a traveler- careless and free, with a bag on my shoulder, traversing the world. Little worries, nothing that would bother me beyond the next meal. 

Find solitude and write.

Call my mum

Taste happiness in every form it takes.

And be a citizen of the world- at every point where the sun shines brighter. 

And die alone, quietly. 

Knowing I lived on my own terms.
