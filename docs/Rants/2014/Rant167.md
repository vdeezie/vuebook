The heartbroken woman is a philosopher

She quotes the dead and the living

Picks pieces of citation from palaces and gutters

She finds God in her moment of tribulation

This holy relationship is always short lived because God is not what she really needs

She needs a man with a brain, a penis and a wallet

Someone society can agree with

And the last one didn’t work out

So she is going to find all the memes that can help describe what she is going through

Hateful, spiritual, judgmental, acidic… some of the acid she gets to drink because she actually thinks she can’t move on without him

She’s a pathetic roll-of-tissue-paper.

She will hold on to friends like a blanket

They’ll console her, shove a picture of the ex-boo in her face and tell her to look at it again:

“Is this what you are crying over? This?! Look at him very well- like a mechanic!”

And that would be all.

She will wear red lipstick and announce she is in the market- again.

The heartbroken man embraces liquor like a new job

He finds his voice- a voice that squirts like a young boy's pee in a gutter

He masks his deficiencies with plenty words

An excess display of talent that begins to make people wonder about his sanity

His heart cannot take this shit

Mourning a lost love

Who will hear of that?

We are Nigerians, how do we begin to explain what a broken heart means?

“Don’t you have work? Heartbroken kwa! When there are many fishes in da ocean? Are you not a man? Toh!”

He is going to dig up every good he has ever done and find solace in them

And every bad she has ever done and to try to justify the break-up

He will try to resuscitate a social life he left behind 

Try to laugh at every joke his friends throw, flirt with the busty waitress at a bar

Then he’ll find another woman the minute he can strike a conversation with any bird on twitter.

And that, my people, is how we deal with our broken hearts.
