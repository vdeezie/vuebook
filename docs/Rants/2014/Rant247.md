# Rant247


October 6, 2014

Death appeals to me.

I am fascinated by it.

The only reason I brush off its charm would be for the responsibility I have as a mother.

I will not chicken out of my duties.

Death is only death when it comes by itself, and knocks on your door.

Anything else is sad or cowardly.

I have lived the way I never thought I could

A brazen fiery existence.

I am fearless.

I can almost taste my audacities on my tongue

It amazes even me, the issues I am willing to strip of its pretences.

Every day I react to life reacting to me

It is not who I used to be

All of my 20s, I can count all the words I uttered- sparse and deliberately bare to integrate, without one strand of hair out of place, into cliques and society’s expectations. I was badly clichéd it was deafening. 

Now I allow myself to love, to get angry, and to heal. Without shame, without fear.

I can’t think of anything more liberating.

I finally get to live as I’ve wanted- to speak without fear or favour.

And it seems that is all I aspire to be- speak my truth.

A small dream compared to all the money people make on the same computer that I use in writing my rants.

I have become a child again, seeking the simple things of life, relishing the details around me.

I am sitting in meetings that pay my bills with extras for splendid movie experience/expensive diners/chic shopping, vacation if I like; yet I have a look that only breaks into a smile when Prisca (or any of my friends), for instance, calls.

I am choosing conversation with one over trips to Abu Dhabi with another.

This is who I am.

I tried to fight it once, and I would sit in very expensive company and be miserable; talks about holiday inn and material splendour, when all I want to do is sit on a beach sand and talk about how the ripples grow.

Pathetic; because that shit doesn’t even make any sense.

Who sits on the beach and talk about ripples in Nigeria?

Who turns down exotic rendezvous?

I feel like I don’t even belong here. 

Because I have tried to like what everybody else likes… 

And I have exhausted my voice.

And I miss my friend Sylvester Barzini.

He is resting in peace. And I am here in this chaotic, evil, selfish world.
