It irks me every time I hear someone say:

“No matter what, family is family…”

It is such a stupid statement; ignorant and airheaded.

Think about women who were raped by their fathers
Sons destroyed emotionally by the words from the lips of their mothers
Siblings bonded by hate and distrust
Greedy relatives who call only when you become (some kind of) success

Dads who abandon their children for years 
Mothers who run off with a lover leaving her responsibilities with an aged grandmother
Uncles who stick their manhood into the mouths of their young nephews…

Sons beat up by their fathers, breaking empty bottles on their heads, brandishing a kitchen knife at them…

For what?

-Because he forgot to sweep the floor, tidy your room, missed curfew?!!!

That is just evil!

And that is NO family!

Adults have the right to decide who should be called “family”. And it doesn’t have to be determined by blood!

Some of us had it good, so good you just want to close your eyes and take in deep breaths of gratitude.

When I was growing up, my mother had one cane that stayed smooth and silky brown for over 10 years on top of her cupboard.

It was never used. Ever!

But would it be fair for me to judge another based on my own family experience and nag him/her to forgive?

Forgive what?

I am not saying you should hold grudges but how do you carry on with a father who called you a “bastard” repeatedly when you were growing up?

Abeg! 

You have a choice in this matter…nobody should bully anybody to be devoted to a family that was never really there when they needed them most as children.

Now you have tasted the goodness of life, some silly mother who couldn’t make the wise decision to take you out of an abusive home is all over your parade, showing love that came many years too late.

Toh!
