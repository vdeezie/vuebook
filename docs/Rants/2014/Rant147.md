I got this quote from a blog:

“Kerry Washington thinks Beyoncé should spend less time shaking her booty and more time pushing other agendas, like the value of education and healthy eating, as well as promoting book reading.”

As much as I agree these are noble things to ask from a music star, how are you sure she is able to deliver on anything else aside from music?

Beyoncé sings, has a nice body, makes big money and have millions of fans, and is standing with a bra top on Times magazine as an influential person…all of that doesn't immediately qualify her to have ready opinions on education, and doesn't automatically make her a book lover ready to travel around America reading to young girls. Her achievements are hers, and they are tied to her music career. 

Isn’t that enough? Why do we continue to expect “other agendas” from pop singers?

What if all they want to do is shake some ass, make loads of money and live with their cheating husbands and bipolar sisters?

Do rats become rabbits if they sleep on a bed long enough?

Education didn’t bring Beyonce to this point. She isn’t half as educated as the average Nigerian/American roaming the streets, writing application letters to a hundred-and-one companies, so why would she be pushing for "value of education" if she isn't a recipient of that experience? Have you listened to her speak?

Hian! 

That voice is made only for singing. The discomfort of picking her words like a kid playing with her cereals disappears when she breaks into a song. Only then do you feel her confidence.

I'm just always confused when I read some quotes. Why do we want to make a Rosa Parks out of every celebrity?
