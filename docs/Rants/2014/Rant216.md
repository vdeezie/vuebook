# Rant216


September 13, 2014

That we treat one another with the kind of respect and regard we give to wrapped chicken thighs in a Shoprite icebox, peppered to suit individual taste, with the option of picking and dropping, looking for the right amount of pepper on thighs to be devoured later at dinner, remains a wonder and slapstick tragic-comedy.

We are virtually strangers, without a word exchanged in nearly 20 years; but within the first full sentence we share, you indecorously beg me to “do something to help you”. 

I am not only shocked but my heart bleeds for this dispensable method of treating the next person- like the butt of a cigarette crushed after its purpose and enjoyment.
 
I detest that! 

I would think of you like I would think of a rabid dog- in that diseased manner.

So you need my help. I do not have any help to offer. This I make very clear without showing my total disgust for your person.

But that is not even the problem... two days later, and out of the blue, you accuse me of talking about you on one of my posts, and then end your rant with “God bless you”… in that very Nigerian method that is supposed to make me feel guilty. But I feel no guilt so I respond to you like I should have the very first time you thought of me like a peppered chicken thigh in a Shoprite icebox.

Apparently this woman reads my wall. Did she not read where I was afraid of having cancer? Did she ask how it must have felt- the wait? Did she, for a second, think of the mental torture of living alone with only books and lots of food to console myself with? 

That I was fucking packing a bag like I was about to make a trip and then with a jolt realising I wouldn’t even need a toothbrush where I might be heading? The fact that I would watch Oprah’s Masterclass and be sad I might be watching it for the last time? 

That I would run my fingers through my coarse wall just to FEEL something other than the anguish of waiting?

(I googled that shit... and it seemed I had all the symptoms. Every single one of them; my doctor wouldn't even look me in the eyes... like he knew something he was afraid to tell me) 

Did she not see that I am also a single parent? If at all she wanted to connect on that level, did she ask for parenting tips? After 20 years, not a word exchanged, did she ask how the years have been? Did she try to strike up a conversation? 

No. She asked for help in that Nigerian Christian mode: help or be damned.

And this is how we apply ourselves to relationships across board.

The level of selfishness we display is extraordinarily high

Nobody is anybody’s disposable income. If you cannot, first, acknowledge the next person as a human being with flaws, with strengths, with their own challenges and pockets of triumph, and with some personal dignity, then you can take a walk to hell.

And stay there.

I am tired, tired, tired of people shopping for peppered chicken thighs.
