Facebook is incestuous 

Don’t ignore those 101 mutual friends glaring at you

You can’t recover from the mess people get up to

Trust only your own motives, your own heart and intentions.

Only publicists can turn humiliation on top of its own head and get the culprits to chew on it for breakfast, while you walk away like a rose.

So if you are having a hard time breathing, holler.

We turn water to ogi; akara to cake; garri to confetti.

One time, a chick ran to me concerning a sex tape about to be used to humiliate her; PR saved her.

Don’t ask how.

Just include us in your budget next year.
