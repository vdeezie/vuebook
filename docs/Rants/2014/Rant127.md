"Nigerian media" actually believes Nigerians do not listen when they speak…

They believe a “beautiful presenter” will save the day with her “beauty”…

They don’t need your opinions, just your smile and a tight dress and an accent- something that sounds like you’ve been to Dubai, Canada and California at some point in your life…

They want conversation but not conversation that is deep or fierce or intelligent or contrary…

They want giggles, a lot of nodding and many:  
“exactly” “absolutely” “incredible” “amazing” “oh wow” garnished with pink blush and horrible weaves.

They want you to shriek when Davido is mentioned and carry your heart in your hands when Dbanj gets in the studio
 
As a presenter it is better to go: “I don’t really read…” or “I don’t know anything about politics…”

It is pertinent that your guests are the only ones with a brain

You should be awed by the sheer intelligence gushing from the mouth of a guest

You are perpetually a "learner"; pretend you are learning by nodding your head and squinting your eyes.

Truth be told, Nigerian media is in love with the "Q&A Presenter"- ask a question and then fold your hands and listen to the wisdom that is about to come forth.

And please, try and stay on the side of society.

You have to agree with all the regular shit society throws around.

Remember to borrow an extra pack of patience and subservience, they will throw disrespect at you and you are expected to catch and chew it like the best cupcakes you’ve ever tasted.

That is why everything on terrestrial TV looks the same.

And that is why we are on DSTV, watching Oprah…and that ugly one, Wendy Williams.

A successful show has nothing to do with the things we worry about…

But how then can we justify our mediocrity if we do not proudly confess one strand of grey hair on a presenter might ruin the show...and so settle for an undergraduate with a big ass (forget that she'll be seated all the time)

We are dumb. Let’s just accept it…

We are dumb people.
