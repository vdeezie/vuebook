September 6, 2014

Two things happened:

I was certain I had cervical cancer. 
I did the test and waited…
Waited…
It was a long four weeks wait.

I decided I wasn’t going to do chemotherapy (especially if it is late detection...the fatal stage)
You do it, suffer the excruciating pain, and still die
All the money I could leave behind for my kids.

I was mentally putting things in place
Sometimes it made me excited I was leaving this riotous earth, other times it made me upset
I worried about my kids a lot

What I was going to do was have a discussion with my mum, then spend the rest of the weeks/months I have left to settle certain issues:

I’ll finally drag someone to court to ensure he pays for the children’s upkeep while they remain with my mother. Fashola has some really cool legal structures in place to wring the balls of irresponsible parents. We are not just taking advantage of it.

For me, I just don’t care.

But the result was negative.
I was relieved in that quiet sense of it.

So I took a drive to my mother to tell her what’s been going on in the last month

“Ah! I will die with you…I will follow you…I will not live in this world without you!”

Calm your tits, mum! Heehee (of course I didn’t say that)
I told her it was negative

I won’t lie, at that moment, sex was the only thing on my mind.
Celebratory sex. LOL!

Maybe if I did alcohol I’d get drunk for having one less problem to worry about.

Yesterday N1.1million was credited to my account

That is N1.1m that is NOT my money.

So I called the company who did the transfer:
“Did you make any transactions with my account?”
“Hello Joy… No, Joy.”

Well they said they didn’t, but the money is sitting in my account and it is not mine.
So I call my good friend, he knows everything…

“Leo, I have N1.1m sitting in my account. It is not mine.”
“Wow. That’s up to 7k USD. It's probably money laundry. Not worth your time abeg. When they do 2million GBP, you and I will elope...we will hire a plane...”

LMAO!!!

I had to bring him back to earth: “What do I do?”
“Call your bank, they’ll sort it out.”

Ok. But I decided to call the company again because I know the CEO. I’d done some PR for them last year…

“Madam, I called earlier…Maybe you don’t understand: N1.1m was credited to my account from yours a few hours ago.”

“WHAT?!” Yup, her response.

So it turned out she was trying to send it to her suppliers and sent it to me.

“Thank you, Joy. Thank you.”

Good thing I am not a Nigerian Christian who’ll go down on her knees and start to thank God for a “miracle”. 
Miracle indeed! With your brain sautéed to believe God will steal from someone’s account with obvious hoofmarks that makes you nothing but crooked when the truth unveils itself.

I’ll be doing movies and drinks with Prisca, celebrating being cancer free and all.

"Being Mrs Elliot" is on my must-see list today! 

Enjoy the life you’ve got.

Happy Weekend!
