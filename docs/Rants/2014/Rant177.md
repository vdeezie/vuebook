A blonde moment...

So I had a meeting with a client at Ikeja mall today…

Went shopping and had lunch… 

Then I found myself at the Cinema, with the movie brochure in my hand…

Half of a Yellow Sun…hmmmm!

I took the N1,500 and bought cupcakes instead

I'm gonna eat this at home like the sexiest thing ever heehee*

Errr…before you judge me, I bought the freaking book for N2,500 back then.

The "movie" never beats the "book" anyways *shrugs*
