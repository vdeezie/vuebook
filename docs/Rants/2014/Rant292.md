# Rant292


November 29, 2014

When I got a private message from someone who was aggrieved because… “Joy, you click like on everybody’s comment except mine. We may not be close but just know that I love you and you don’t have to be my friend before you acknowledge my own comments like you acknowledge others…” I was pissed, until I decided to un-piss myself.

Look at it from a different perspective. Take a deep breath and act differently.

So I sent an apology.

And here is why:
As much as I do not understand the connection between clicking “like” and the true worth of a comment or a person or the relationship I have with the person, I understand that people come from very different backgrounds with varied interpretations to life. And these things that mean nothing to me might be a big deal to someone else.

I appreciate that she could tell me. She could have just stopped talking to me (which is fine really…Life. Time. Too short). Yet I really do appreciate that, regardless of how frivolous the issue might seem, it was an issue she was willing to share and was willing to risk a response- positive or negative; what if I mocked her or made a fuss; it was a risk she was willing to take.

She dared to put a piece of her vulnerabilities and insecurities on display and in my care. She trusted me with her angst and concerns.  Why would I want to slap her in the face even though it might sound really trivial and unnecessary for most?

I called another friend recently to apologise. I believe she was severely hurt by a certain issue I didn’t take as seriously as she’d wanted me to. I do have a right not to take any issue seriously and I practice that right well. BUT, just like in the first instance, she was vulnerable and I told her to “get over it” too many times it probably sounded as if I didn’t care.

Someone I have never had any prior dealings with told me that he didn’t like the way he was introduced at an event recently, “Almost like I wasn’t special, like I didn’t matter,” he said.

“How?” I wondered. I stopped wondering and just apologised…because I just can’t deal with people’s egos and demons right now.

I am a very passionate person. I care greatly about the people I care about; greatly, beyond comprehension. I am not wired to care a little. I care too much, I stay awake caring, I eat caring, I go about my business caring greatly about the few things/people I choose to care about. I cannot care for too many things because I cannot care un-greatly, it has to be great; it has to be epic, grand and all that 18th century paroxysms. 

So when I care in this great fashion, it saps all my energy and spirit (that emotional drain I feel afterwards is refreshing) and there’s only little left of me to spread across the table. I am built to care only greatly.

Thus, I toss 99% of life’s issues behind. I can’t give that much attention to everything. I can’t care greatly for your broken pencil because I am at present caring greatly for, say, a friend’s emotional dilemma. But my head will tell you, pencil owner, to buy another one, and that is where people get upset because they need you to pour your emotions into that pencil.

There are people who are “enemies” that I didn’t know were “enemies” until we meet at certain events and they throw their faces away like squelch of cow dung on a wall. 

It may have been a post, a grin, an inbox message that was not replied…it could have been anything! People react to the flimsiest matter; they give weight to the most trivial issues.

I am not even mad, I do understand.

If making enemies come naturally to you, you should make the right ones. The kind that will haunt you wherever turn you take on social media and beyond. That is proactive enemy-making scheme.

So there.

But I deviate.

I think it is unnecessary to care about things like “likes” and “re-tweets” because someone’s sister just died, someone just lost a huge sum of money on a deal gone awry; someone is in prison for all the wrong reasons; someone needs a job; someone needs to sort a few really important issues; someone needs to make the right decision on certain matters. These are more important things to worry about. 

But if you really have to worry about social media issues, then don’t make impulsive enemies; speak out your grievances and watch the person do to you as they wish.

For your own good, I hope they be gentle.
