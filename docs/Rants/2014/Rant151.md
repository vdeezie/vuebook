# Rant151


August 5, 2014

So it won’t seem like I don’t have anything other than heartrending stories with sour toppings to share, I have decided to keep the next 24 hours of rant cheery and bright.

To kick off this colourful mood I’m in, I will like to share with you this hot picture- so hot, my heart skipped a beat.

It is Mr. Universe 2014, Francis, in sexy soggy diapers.
