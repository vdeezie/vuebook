I have long demystified the ‘old man’s theory’

In Nigeria, if you are old- that is all you’d need to be.

Old.

You carry your old age around like a prize, telling people what to do, how to do it and giving unsolicited advice, critiquing ideas and work you cannot do…

For just being old, you are taken seriously.

I have very little respect for age. In fact, I have none.

I couldn’t possibly judge anyone based on how young or old they are.

"Old Age" has fucked Nigeria up so badly it is a shock that we still fall for it.

Check any rot in any industry in Nigeria, you will find an old man lurking in the centre of it with a big mouth and a few interesting stories to share with silly young folks who have refused to THINK; like children sitting under a tree waiting for tales by moonlight. They are telling you how things should be done, BUT doing NOTHING.

And yet they’d have these young folks, who should be thinking of new and fresh ways of improving a sick industry- dying of neglect and arrogance, loitering around the Old, trying to gain Old favours...hustling for Old attention.

Are you normal at all?

Check, it exists in your own industry, wherever it is you work.

We are where we are in this country because of these smart-talking yet clueless or sometimes just plain wicked Old folks who care nothing about progress, just a bunch of people willing to caress his phallus.

We are here working! Some “young people” are trying to get things done, struggling, building, collating, making business decisions. Working ten times harder than the Old ever did.

Yet, for some reason, we are expected to ask for the “blessings” of the Old.

If they had any "blessings" to give, will this country be the pit toilet that it is? That’s even stretching it too far- will their industry be a pathetic mosquito net, a torn miserable cloth, as it is?

I don’t see the point. Nobody should ever tell me to seek love and approval and acceptance and blessing from any old person- just for the sake of being old.

I will seek “blessing” from anyone- a 23 year old even, if I see how hard s/he is bursting her/his ass to build a brand, to build a craft, and to support the industry s/he belongs.

We keep seeking for approval from people who wish they had half the oomph we have.

Toh!
