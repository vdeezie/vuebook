Joseph Benjamin will be hosted by Johnny Walker Blue Label at Pravada lounge, Victoria Island, this Sunday (September28)

I hope to be excused of ghetto snobbery when I say I will first try killing myself before I will sit through an Island night club gig.

But this is Joseph- my good friend and client, he gave me 5 passes and so I wish to invite: Funke Tega Phillips, Prisca Egbukuchi, Funmi Akinsola, Yemisi Sawyerr.

Joseph is a wonderful and down-to-earth individual, and I am sure even he will be wondering how he’ll survive the night. LOL!

Island gigs? Ta!

I will be rolling my eyes half the time.

I know me. I do not like to pretend that I do not know me.

Another thing, we are supposed to have drinks and chops on the house, but you know how these things go, they will drop one miserable plate for five people on the table and disappear into cigarette-induced air. I refuse to spend ridiculous amounts of money to eat any peppered animal on an Island club budget.

I talk to Joseph every day so I am not some awestruck fan who wants this one opportunity to take a selfie with him and load on Instagram

The Island dudes with brains like bloated barbie dolls will suffocate you. They already think themselves superior before they even say hi. 

They are looking at your skin to decide your scale of sophistication. These men know fake weaves even in the dim lights of the night. They don’t care about a lot of what makes you amazing and different. They just want something of an accessory to show off at the next gig they get to attend. 

It’s excessive pretention that is sustained on very huge budgets. I’m talking thousands of dollars to keep up with appearances and cliques and delusions.

It's like high school, just a lot more expensive. Island people can gossip for all of Africa.

There's a lot more, but let me leave it at that.

So, what do you say girls? We are going to meet a lot of bleached-out, weaves-between-the-thigh, accent-without-nationality, starved-of-an-extra-million-dollar, aspiring-to-have-sex-with-Dbanj groupies all over the place.

Do we go watch a movie, then head to the beach, then have dinner at the pent house of SL at The Palms instead (at least we will be meeting people on our own terms)?
 
OR

Do we risk it all and fit into a stereotype for one night.

If you choose the latter, just know that I will be wearing thick eyeglasses and will bring a book along, just to piss everybody off.

LOOOL! *sips coffee*
