At this time of all our lives, women are still talking about physical beauty.

“Ah my ass is softer.”
“I look good for my age.”
“She looks fat for her age.”
“I rock abeg, see my legs.”

In 2014? You are a loser. A sham and a disgrace.

What beauty does Oprah have again? Can you measure it with your withering brain? Is it physical? Is it behind her or between her thighs?

The Nigerian woman bags a load of esteem the minute she can find a man to tell her:
“You are beautiful sha"
"You have a fine shape, better than my ex"
"I like whattasee” 

Then, from nowhere, she begins to imagine herself some kind of Cleopatra, and every woman her maid. Begins to suffer paranoia- "there are women envious of me."

Starts a barrage of nonsense of how sexy she is, working up a hot pot of hate just so people can see she is having enough sex and/or idling on sexting; and there’s a boyfriend by the side to cheer her on.

High school behaviour. Your mates are building careers.

This is why I die everyday. Because it will be a shame to be alive and be one of you.
