What if this is all a dream…

Then I pinch myself so hard and wake up to reality

To find that I am just a beggar camping under a bridge in Ojuelegba

With no money and no food

And no strong opinions, no admirers

Just dirt poor, waiting for the next meal

No ambitions, no hustle.

All that I think I am isn't real

I have lived too long in a dream.

In reality they call me Iya Egba (or something coined from staying under that particular bridge for so long)

Then I have to drift into these hallucinations to run away from my truths

And become Isi…

For as long as I do not pinch myself too hard to confront reality.

What if what we really are is just a hard pinch away from what we have lived all our lives believing?

I am not making sense. I should go to bed.
