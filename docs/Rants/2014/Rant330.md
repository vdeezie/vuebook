Dear Agony Aunt,

I got a gift from someone... and I sent it back.

He was upset, of course.

“This has never happened to me before,” he said

“Sorry, there’s always a first time,” I responded.

You see, aunty agony, I too have never received a gift like that before; so when he said I shouldn’t have returned it but given it to my driver’s wife or my generator repairer, I knew that truly returning it was the best thing. I was truly offended.

“So you had a driver and a generator repairer in your skull when you were buying this, abi?”

“No. Not at all. But to return it is hurtful.”

“Nah. Tossing it to any of them would have hurt me because I think very little of your gift.”

“It is the gesture that counts,” he cried.

*sighs* Gestures are only for friends, aunty agony, right? He is not a friend. And I will not let him be anything else. So does gesture still apply to “toasters”?

Hian!

Anyways, aunty agony, I still insist returning it was the best thing. He must have learned something priceless that other women may not care to teach him:

You do not buy perfume for a woman until you are certain what range of perfume she wears.

And by God, you do not buy imitation!!! *cringing*

Buy a damn towel instead.

And the rest of the content of the gift was, well…*sighs*

Besides, I do not toss gifts I reject from my soul to someone society would place beneath me; same way I believe that to give to the needy, I have to be able to eat what I give them, wear what I present to them.

It’s a mind-set that I am not about to change.

So, agony aunt, what do you think? Have I been a bad girl?
