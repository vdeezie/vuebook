The scariest thing about life is life; to be specific, the tragedy that life is made of. 

Nobody escapes it- the many unpleasant surprises of life. They scowl, they taunt and they hold on to your garment. Sometimes we yank its firm grip off, other times it wins, and we give in.

So Myles Monroe gave in. All his years, he must have spent a good part of it yanking life’s ultimate tragedy called death off his sleeves- every time he got on a plane or in a car or even dared to breathe…

Like many Nigerians, travelling through Ibadan-Expressway, flying across bridges in okada, surrendering our lives into the hands of ill-trained riders. Every day we hit death off our sleeves.

That day will come when you wouldn’t have the fight anymore; or you’d be caught up in life’s activities, oblivious of how tight the grip is.

So Monroe is dead? Ok! Now Christians give it a break. 

He was human, he is dead. Isn't that how it works? If you believe what you believe then surely he is in a “better place.” So swallow your philosophies and questions and continue living your own life.

Who knows? You might be next.

If you believe he sinned and is rewarded with death, you begin to make your god look like a monster.

When you consider the tons of African rulers sick-to-the-back with ill-gotten wealth and hopeless intentions, ruling with the help of amnesia or some old man’s disease, and death hasn’t yet slapped the life out of them, then you can understand how life or death simply means nothing to God.

Whether you live, whether you die, He is God. Whatever you do doesn’t change that fact. 

Your misery, your wealth; your love, your hate; your needs, your desires. 

God is God regardless.

And as you can see, away from Old Testament living and His desperate need to show off and impress “His people” back then; these days, He is chilling on his throne with a glass of pina colada. 

Almost uninterested. 

Whether life or death; He is.

And if life is over, He still is.

–Because most of the shit of the earth is caused by your kind; your business.

Fix it!

Now back to this issue of unforeseen death and the need for Christians to build idiotic theories around everything…

I recall the death of a former pastor in a church I used to attend. He had diabetes and for the sake of the gospel of healing, no one knew about this. He wanted to be healed spiritually without the function of orthodox treatment. He was apparently ashamed to have this disease, especially with his firm belief in spiritual healing.

He died.

And so, this church that had spent all its time preaching about tithing and its direct effect on health and long life, was embarrassed. So embarrassed they had to come up with an explanation…

A pastor from another church was called to raise him from death bed. Balls of sweat later, he was still dead.

But we were left with a word, from heaven:

“God said we should let him go. He needs him.” *roll eyes until they drop into a glass of Hennessy VSOP*

And so we let him go.

What foolery!

That day, I repented of my foolishness. 

That we continue to fondle our genitals in the hope that cerebral and/or spiritual judgements/inferences can be reached to appease our curiosities is the only real tragedy to life.

I don’t know why we continuously question death. The only time it is unappealing is when it is unforgiving, long and torturous (like the ALUU 4 type of disaster)

As far as I know, I am dead. 

I died because I was afraid of living. How do you live in this chaotic world without losing your mind?

I couldn’t function as a living being. I achieved very little. So I had to die.

Your words, your lies, your hate, your envy, your bitterness, your scores of stupid actions and subs, do not get to me.

I am dead.

Fear was my life. I got tired of fear and so I died to everything that creates fear or anxiety or pain. 

I am blank. Like a canvass; whatever you paint, you get.

Monroe touched me. I read all his literature and enjoyed his conferences. He is fine wherever he is at the moment. 

What about you, have you had lunch today?
