# Rant328


December 28, 2014

This 2015, I want peace.

The reason I left twitter. I can’t deal with half the mess that goes on there. Retarded sub-tweets, ego clashing with mental illnesses and people just being mean for no reason- just because they can.

These things are not directed at me, of course. But I see them and I itch to defend or tweet or react…but then you just move on. It is a chaotic place. I just couldn’t.

But I am here on Facebook. So the rules are clear:

If you are spiteful whether with your so-called “Nigerian happyness” that is always full of malice and mischief, I will unfriend you.

If you write any stupid sub-post trying to catch my attention, I will unfriend you

If you are disrespectful or I sense that you are trying to be insolent, I will unfriend you

If you twist my post and allow it walk on its head, I will block you.

I just want peace. I want to focus on what’s important. And I hope you do too. Some maturity will help. Grow it at your backyard.

If twitter is dying of pneumonia this minute, it affects me not. As far as I am concerned, personally, that platform doesn’t exist.

You cannot begin to measure that kind of peace.

And I had a good number of well-wishers, but I gave it all up for peace. So I don’t get to see those itchy subjects and tweets that would make me think of the next person as an idiot.

Peace.

Stay away from my wall if my rants don’t appeal to you. Unfriend me, please and never come back.

In 2015, even if I have to lose everything and everyone, I will…for peace sake.
