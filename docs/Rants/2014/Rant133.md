#Rant133

I’ve been waiting to get a few hits in my account before doing this:

Take my mum to the mall at Ikeja and buy her items from every store- from Da Viva to Swatch to Slot to Perfumery…and on and on, until we get to Shoprite and fill a pushcart.

But that bank alert is yet to happen.

So I have decided to take her out regardless, and buy the things that I can afford now:

Drinks and gist at Bheehugz
A Gollywood movie showing today
Filling that pushcart at Shoprite
Chic jewellery at the popular store
Sunglasses, yes, she's been asking for a certain type
A nice cardigan (she gets cold too quickly these days)
Smoothies at Rhapsody
Then dinner…definitely dinner at Jevinik at GRA.

I hope she likes the line-up.

I'll be rolling around in bohemian curls, the size of a gladiator's headgear.
