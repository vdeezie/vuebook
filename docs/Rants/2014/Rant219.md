I have a friend who is usually attracted to a stereotype…

Long wavy expensive Peruvian weave, Louboutin heels, red lipstick, thin voice full of aspirational philandering, probably a-little-bleaching, of a high-end indoctrination- from cars to travel to the little black dress, a lot of swanky pretention… you know the type.

He tries to play it down when we talk and even hopes to defend and/or deny it to a degree.

Today, when he called and the conversation tilted towards that discussion, I stopped him for a minute to say…

“X, it is ok to like what you like. It really is. You are an adult and as long as it is not illegal, go on and be you.”

He says he is trying to get out of that stereotype to discover other type women…

“You see, right now I am trying to be with other types of…”

Again I interrupt…

“That is the problem, TRYING. Do not try; you are going to struggle through it and build someone’s hopes only to dash it to blisters the minute a Brazilian-wearing tot walks by. It’s ridiculous…because, really, you are not attracted to anything other than what you are attracted to.”

People like what they like. That is why I will never understand this dark-skinned Vs. light-skinned brouhaha amongst African Americans. You cannot force a man/woman to be with someone just because you think it gives a cerebral and unconventional gloss to his/her persona.

I know people who would turn up their noses the minute a Nigerian man says he prefers “half-castes”. 

They would even ask, “why”

Why?

How rude.

He likes what he likes. Period.

Many women like the rich man with a slight bulge; forget conversation and poetry in bed, they want to travel first-class to Paris!

Why do we feel the need to judge and try to alter people’s desirability and preferences? 

The only time I would make any kind of judgment is if someone is lurking and is obsessed with an abuser. 

For men who would choose big boobs over intelligence; phony accent over substance…women who choose money over charm; looks over brainpower… it is not for you to tell an adult who they should wake up next to every morning.

I think.
