While I await good copies of my book (and plead to all who have paid to be patient...like the 100 copies paid and sent to Minna *sigh*), I have the first review in by Dami Ajayi

There are very few things better than the Oris’ and the Damis’ and the Toni Kans’ making the effort to build an opinion about your work.

I am grateful.

“What Pain May Bring, Joy Isi Bewaji’s second book, is a collection of a novella and short stories on the different kinds of heart break and how people deal with it. A five year hiatus followed her first book, Eko Dialogue and she has shifted her attention from the periphery of a metropolitan engagement to a surgical exposé of the very motives that move people to take actions. These actions are varied and often scandalous: from murder to suicide to abandonment of responsibility to eloping to retribution. Ultimately, it is all about retribution…

Told with very witty and humorous prose... Great sentences abound in this book... Bewaji has written yet another book of genuine human value.”
