I begin my evening with one outrageous date I had. 

It all came back to me because he called a minute ago…

“You don’t have my number again ehn, Joy?!” 

I didn’t. And I didn’t recognise his voice.

“This is Gbolahan.”

I met Gbolahan at The Palms. It was four years ago, I was hanging out with three friends. We were heading to the club, but we made a quick stop at Shoprite to get groceries. 

Gbolahan came to us as we were stuffing groceries in the car.

“Hello, my name’s Gbolahan.”

He was super confident, the kind that would easily walk to Buckingham Palace, kiss the Queen's hand, wink at her then stroll out- back into the afternoon sun. 

But it was 8pm. When girls plan a night out, the thought of meeting a few nice guys is always lurking in the air. Ours just happened way too soon.

“So what’s your name?” he was talking to me.

“Her name is Joy.” Funsho, my friend, responded.

“I like her,” he said and was looking at me- straight in the eye.

“I like you,” he said it directly to me this time.

“What do you want her to say? Thank you?” Funmi, the other friend, interjected.

“Let her speak for herself nah…”

We all started laughing. His friend joined us, and we went clubbing- we, in our car; they, in theirs.

That night went well. 

The second date, we "was" hanging out alone without friends. It was supposed to be special.

Auto Lounge. We try conversation but it just didn’t work. I yawned. He got upset that I yawned. I apologised *roll eyes*

I send a text to Funsho: “Help me. I am dying of boredom!”

She replied: “Die there.”

After a torturous night (for a teetotaler like me, conversation is everything), we get into his car. He is supposed to drop me off at a place where I can pick a taxi.

“All these agberos…” he said, “they want a hundred naira. Wind down the car window and try to distract them with pleasantries, I’ll pull out slowly and make a run for it.”

I swear that was what he said.

Gbolahan works in Mobil as a senior executive.

How can I ever forgive that?

And so it ended before it even started.

Stingy men get no love.
