I remember one time while I was listening to the radio (aaaarghhh!!!)

Kenny Saint Brown was talking…she was the shit back then:

“I have two Masters Degree…a wonderful husband…with all my singing and tour…he tries to make me happy when I get back home…he makes me delicious food... he is a good COOKER…”

Then I understood why Eddy Montana had a temper.
