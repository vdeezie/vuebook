Pelu Awofeso's enthusiasm and constant buzz concerning the upcoming session “The Business of Writing” has been very warm and encouraging. 

He calls, he mails, sends encouraging texts. I’m overwhelmed by the deluge of affection and support.

Thank you.

I admire his life. So when he tells me he is under pressure to “settle down”, I say it bluntly:

Don’t. 

Period. 

Do not “settle down”- whatever the heck that means!

There is nothing on this side of the fence worth giving your dreams up for. You will become another father, another husband, another parent worried about exorbitant fees and wet diapers; another adult on the couch thinking of where he’d want to go, what he needs to do, but giving it all up for the giggle of a child or the need of a wife.

There are millions already living that life. Look around you, see how ordinary it all is.

Look at Onyeka Nwelue, living the life of a thousand men. Relieved of everything that worries a man. Free, alive, vibrant, fearless, different.

Then look at the man beside you, jumping from one woman to the other, looking for someone to define his need, satiate his ego, living an unoriginal script. 

Then ask yourself, why do we want more men acting in the same lacklustre movie?

That is my advice to anyone who is not everyone.
