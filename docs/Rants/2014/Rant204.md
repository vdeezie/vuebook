# Rant204


September 4, 2014

Evenings reek of melancholy and fatigue, so I always jazz it up with a few things, in this order:

Take a shower

Grab a soft tee-shirt or a lazy knee-length dress that feels like romance

Shuffle around the kitchen looking for a quick snack

Then a glass of something cold

Facebook to make me giggle

Then TV, a bit of Suits or any desperate reality show

Crime and Investigation follows and takes a large chunk of the hour…

Then Fashion Police with Joan Rivers and her wicked wit…

Now she is gone

I will miss the ridiculousness of her botox-ed face that makes it impossible for her to laugh

And her objective, entertaining and kick-ass fashion reporting/critique 

RIP, Joan Rivers
