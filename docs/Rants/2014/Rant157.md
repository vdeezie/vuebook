# Rant157


August 8, 2014

I heard about one Ebola twitter handle, and I was excited…

(because, really, even with all the news flying around, and do-not-panic buzz, I am yet to understand how an underdeveloped nation can survive a virus that is transmitted through sweat…sweat in a 3-hour Lagos traffic to an appointment, in a skin-to-skin bus…straight into a meeting, for instance…)

Just to find that the last tweet was yet another typical Nigerian ass-licking activity:

“Many thanks to @atiku for his support of @ebolafacts. Bless you sir!”

*sighs* we can’t help it, can we?

The last tweet was 22 hours ago.

For a virus that kills with rapid concentration, hundreds of people would have to die before the next tweet.

But I have grown bitter, confused, unhappy and paranoid in the last couple of days, so this is just another rant.

Bitter with the government that, as yet, has no awareness campaign running. 

Markets should be swarmed with Ebola tee-wearing individuals with authority to stop business activities for just 20minutes to share vital information on how to stay safe, what to do and numbers to call.

Confused by all the myths and errors of cure.

Unhappy that we have to live at a time like this surrounded by religious witchcraft and political thievery that suck to the last drop our humanity.

Paranoid… just paranoid.

And I feel life ease out of me for the jokes we are still cool enough to make of this epidemic, and for such raw ignorance…

Unfortunately I was tagged on a post I had no business being tagged on...and this was what someone had to say:

“If the fluid of snail mixed with agamsoso leaf can stop snake from biting u, why won't salt and water prevent Ebola? It's time u start believing in African science...”

I give up everyday.
