...and I hear this all the time:

If your wife is fat, enrol her in a gym

If she is dirty, get a cleaner

If she cannot save, open a bank account for her and ensure there’s direct fund going into it

If she has no vision, open a business for her and pay a manager to help her out OR get her a 9-5

What is this?

Are men getting married to 10 year-olds?

So…you give a husband the responsibility of taking care of every single detail in the life of another adult.

Is the wife a retard? An imbecile? A domestic animal?

(If she is boring in bed, can he enrol a "sexpert" to have raunchy sex with so wifey can sit and watch?)

You are a feminist speaking from one side of your mouth and then you are waiting for a man to teach you how to flush the toilet after taking a dump.

You will leave the loaf of shit there until he hires a home manager to guide you on how to flush.

Stop this stupidity, abeg!

I am supposed to be on FB leave sorting my own life out…and then y’all come with this amazing idiocy…

Ticking me off endlessly.

mscheeeew!
