I am reading Kitty Kelley’s unauthorised biography of Oprah.

Unauthorised because, well, Kelley’s attempts to involve Oprah- to get her solid endorsements didn’t happen.

Oprah did not permit or support the material and turned down an interview with Kelley.

But Kelley is quite good with biographies, and as I am in the middle of similar work, I thought it’d be good to see her style and appreciate the angles at which she builds her subject, the emotions and events.

I find biographies annoying if all it does is butter over a character.

There are no perfect human beings, so the writer must attempt to portray all sides even though the chunk of it would be glorious in its presentation of all-the-good the subject has and can do (unless we are talking about a despot).

But this Oprah book by Kitty Kelley is quite a load of horse shit.

But I am not done yet, may be it will get better; so far, few pages down, Kelley manages to get all the jealous, bitter high school classmates, aunts and cousins who have nasty, stupid, plainly ridiculous crap to share…

“Oprah liked my boyfriend when we were younger and made attempts to woo him. I knew he didn’t like her but that didn’t stop her. She went on radio once to dedicate a song to him. I wasn’t offended because I knew he didn’t want her…”- a former acquaintance 

“Nobody liked Oprah in high school, not even the lecturers. She would attack them with counter arguments and demand to be heard. She was too bossy…”- a former classmate

“All she said about being sexually abused was a lie. She did it to get attention. She said she grew up with cockroaches- lies! We were poor but grandma’s house was squeaky clean…”- a cousin

I didn't expect Kelley to fawn over Oprah, but this right here is just plain envy and malice; unsubstantiated poop. 

You can’t just pick every ugly witch that has passed through Oprah's (or any figure for that matter) life, who’s probably just bitter and unhappy with their own lives to contribute to a book dedicated to her.

It leaves a bad taste on my tongue. It’s one thing to deal with shitty opinions on social media, another thing entirely to haunt these demons down to catalogue their disdain of someone who has lived their dreams and topped it with cream.

I have pushed the book aside for now. 

Lord knows I can’t deal with such alarming negativity at this my old age.
