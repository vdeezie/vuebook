# Rant242


October 2, 2014

I try not to get into these arguments but I find myself drawn in. Like a rash I need to get rid of it…

That feminism is “misleading other women to act like men thereby living lonely lives” and other daft observations from chronically idiotic people who should either stop beating their wives or get out of the marriage that has made a mess of their common sense, is something that is too irritating to consider.

Feminism promises nothing but equality, and like a lot of people would argue…

“Who is holding the woman down?”

The answer will vary from community to community. 

But in many situations, it is the woman that holds herself down because she listens to patriarchy.

In many cases patriarchy is subtle and vague, but it is there. If you pay attention you will hear- like a still small voice.

So the deal is, do not pay attention. It will soon fizzle to zero audio.

Feminism is a choice; unlike patriarchy, you’d have to accept it. Patriarchy on the other hand is a system that you are born into; it is bestowed on you.

So you choose feminism because it answers some of the nagging questions locked in your heart. 

You gain a hold of its truths and share with your world; like everything we do- from religion, to a handshake, to a group of people decked in aso-ebi, we share a part of us with the rest of us.

Now, how something so straightforward continues to befuddle Nigerians remains a wonder.

You want a woman unblemished by feminism? Please go ahead and be with one; there are millions of women out there who cannot even spell the word or have ever heard of it. 

But to constantly whine about how feminism is making your penis limp is annoying.

Feminists are not against marriage; it is against men stopping their wives from building careers/businesses; it is against abuse. It is against women bringing up their girls like second-class citizens, it is against sexism.

And may it be known that the loneliest people on earth are Nigerian married women.

Your arguments on this matter don’t count. Go and argue that unarguable point on your wall.

Nigerian married women are lonely. They have a husband who is always “busy”. He is not going to allow you run your business or career beyond a certain hour (that is if he gets you to run at all). 

You perpetually smell of egusi soup and baby poop. He is “busy”. You are at home. He comes home, you talk about urine on sliding doors and money for baby powder. 

You have sex. He yawns, he sleeps.

Your hours are numbered. You can’t stay out late. You can’t keep certain friends. Can’t wear certain clothes. Can't say certain things. 

And for some reason, we want our daughters to aspire to this life of slavery?!!

All of your husband’s excitement is stored in a bottle for a mistress out there. With her, he smiles; he travels, he tries out a few sexual stunts. He has no plans to marry her, but he gives her his best years and all his attention.

He will return to you when it fizzles out- in another three years; only for a year or so before he jumps on the lap of another mistress.

Patriarchy tells you that you are the entitled one. You are not.

When he dies, his brothers and his mother will kick you out and throw your children on top of your head. You’ll be left with only the sympathy of the public.

You lived lonely, and you died wretched. No skills, the only skill you have is how to give missionary fuck and cook pots of egusi soup. 

In life, he gave you a remnant of himself; in death, he left you with nothing.

This is not a feminist rant, it is Joy’s opinion. I stand firmly on what I believe.

It wouldn’t apply to all marriages, but by God, it applies to many, in the ratio of poverty vs wealth on these streets.

Loneliness is the sole inheritance of the non-feminist. Even in the midst of company, she is lonely.

What can be sadder than that?

Personally, I get too many attention, I don’t know what to do with it. 

I am not against marriage, just as much as I am not against having a cup of ice cream when you need to diet.

I am against the belief that every woman aspires to it- this parody of happiness in the guise of marriage.

Good conversation and great sex. Period.

And respect. Yes, a whole lot of respect from the fuck that we share.

In this era, that should be enough for any woman, but NO...you are looking for a ring from a man with three baby mamas and a N45k job!

Please ehn, stop equating your girlfriend’s new found wit to feminism. Just because she finally gets to tell you that the sex is bad, she has been faking an orgasm for one year and your ambitions are unimpressive doesn’t make her a feminist.

This is the reason many girls pretend to be a little more intelligent than the hole in a doughnut because they want to have you think they have no criteria or benchmarks that will scare you away.. 

The result of pretense is what you see everywhere. Day-old marriages crumbling like a TB Joshua’s building…

Because people want women to blame feminism for all their problems and find loneliness in marriage acceptable.

Nothing irritates me more than a woman looking at the time and crying, "Ah! I have to be home before 4pm or else my husband will be very upset. My curfew is near."

If you resist violence in marriage, they call you feminist.
If you fight to keep your job regardless of the rant of a husband, aaaaah! You have grown two heads.
If you insist that you are tired and cannot cook tonight, you might as well park your load
If you have any opinion contrary to what the other holds, you are unfit for marriage.

But this is none of my business, as much as the life of a feminist is none of yours.
