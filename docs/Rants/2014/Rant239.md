In many ways, living the Nigerian life defies comprehension.

Every day I give up.

I throw in the towel and crash to the floor.

Every day, I am more convinced, than I was the day before, that our politicians are the least of our problems.

If the best of us get into power, we will create the best crimes and best looting; carry out impressive conspiratorial offences, and out-of-this-world corruption froth with high intellectual and grand cerebral plots.

The best of us will ruin this country better.

That is all.

These ones in power; most of them ill-educated…we are only offended by their shabby and unrefined methods of corruption. Their obvious lapses and shallow theories. Not the act, just their crude manner of stealing.

But this post is not about corruption, it is about communicating effectively.

My people contrary to popular belief, there is a difference between a PRESS CONFERENCE and a DIALOGUE session.

Do not sell one for the other. It is not only distasteful, it is dishonest.

Many observations, a few experiences, and I have evolved into this woman who has no desire to fit in. I just cannot fit in. I have tried. I dedicated all of my 20s to become one crunchy pringle in a pack. It was a miserable 20s.

So I have embraced my madness and conventions.

My loyalties are very few and so it accords me the chance to speak my truths every time.

I provide my own water, my own electricity, I build my own opportunities, create my own entertainment, squeeze blood out of my bank account to pay for primary education for two kids.

I am a country of my own. 

Treat me like you would treat America.

So if Nigeria wants to deal with or communicate with this country called Joy, do not deliberately pass on distorted information based on your little respect for my time and resources.

This country called Joy has to provide for her own citizens and will be utterly offended if her hours are misused.

As it stands, this country called Joy has had many dealings with Nigeria. She has concluded that only a miracle- a clear spark from heaven, can help Nigeria.

Nigerians cannot help themselves. 

It is like the case of the King strutting majestically around town in his underwear, believing he is dressed in the most magnificent attire.
All the Island “big boys and big girls” clap and cheer and nod and eulogise…

It took a child in Ajegunle to cry,

“Bhet…sah…you are naked nah.”

That is your case, Nigeria.

I am tired of you, tired of your pseudo-fancy, pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-glitz existence. 

I have no time, no interest in you.

Please, leave me alone; let me focus on my citizens (comprising two beautiful girls and a loving mother) and the development of my own country.

And when you do discover how to run your affairs, sincerely addressing your shortcomings that have persisted for decades, maybe we can have a drink.

This is all I will say on this matter that I have decided to say nothing about.
