A society that scorns Linda Ikeji yet tolerates Stella Dimorkrackass' shoddiness, is a hypocritical piece of shit; and I do not wish to be part of it.

When Stella picked up a Facebook brawl and pieced together a shameful blog post that was re-enacted for her bedroom masturbation sessions- cougar shit high on phlegm, re-blogged by all the shameless twats like Ladun and a few ugly cows… (I am yet to read it...I will not read it or the post that got her nipples twerking. Reports show it was nasty as king kong's poop)

When idiots on twitter, bloody muscular/twisted witches, ugly from the depth of their soul, jealous, horny, losing at every end of life, picking the pieces of my existence to see what they can touch to make themselves whole again, mocked at a version of a story that only dragged their breasts closer to their toes…

It was ONLY Linda who sent me an email to ask:

“Joy, what is going on?”

And with my report, she didn’t publish anything to that effect.

“Don’t worry, this will pass,” she said to me.

I am not Linda’s friend. I have never met her.

I may not agree with the part of her business that warrants copy-and-paste in its broad form but she was the only human being in a house full of animals when shit hit the fan. 

On her "sin", I have shared my displeasure privately with one or two people, even alerted Toni Kan at some point.

But as long as Stella exists without an inch of professionalism, with scales of deceit as skin, for what she does; and all ‘em cowards who shrink at the mention of her name…

As long as you accommodate her…if you can live with her mess, you can accommodate anything else.

Whatever. Bring it on.
