# Rant104

So it’s been donkey months since GenVoices…

When I brought up the issue and tried to ask questions on my own wall, I was rebuked like a child dipping her hand into boiling water. 

That is “our way” in this sick country- don’t ask questions!

If you cannot move with the joneses, you’ll be asked to, “go and die.”

If you would dare to question motives and purposes, you’ll be attacked viciously.

Oh! And was I not warned to stop my posts, that these folks are powerful enough to employ me and change my life for good- forever! So I need to appease them with cute kind words instead of queries?

LMAO! I am sorry but I am not waiting in line for any favours.

We are all a mess!

I assume meetings have been held, praises distributed across tables, handshakes and twitter handles symbolizing trust and association. Wines, dinners and friendships made- YET how did GenVoices change your life?!

Away from robust essays on ynaija! Away from idiotic rants on twitter to bully people to submission.

Look in the mirror and ask yourself how that tele-thon translated into success even in the way we respond to one another.

In true Nigerian format, the organisers believe they have touched lives and I am just one of the haters.

“If you are so smart go and do your own.”

Truth is, like all the invites I get to join 100 youths to dine with GEJ that I never honour, I am yet to understand the impact of these things.

Most of these events are ass-licking charade. We are not asking the questions we need to ask ourselves!

What did Gen Voices achieve?

Did it even trigger public discussion?

Did it change mindsets?

Or just another cool party for Peruvian weaves and Champagne loving people...and an opportunity to get some twitter lords to feel like celebrities only for a minute?

Are you not tired of these pretensions?

*sighs!
