After “The Business of Writing”, super-crush actor Demola Adedoyin (prince Aderopo, October 1) picked me up and drove to Eko Hotel for a Photo Exhibition- a graphic array of droopy breasts, molue, adire, masquerades, and bright conversations.

One waitress with a tray of peppered chicken walked by and whispered, “Hello Prince”

I could have sworn I saw her wink. LOL!

And of course, happy people who hugged and chatted with him.

He took it all in quite graciously.

I enjoyed Colonades Hotel's hospitality so much I decided to stay another night- alone.

Life’s short.

When I am rested I will talk about how brilliant “The Business of Writing” session was.

Thanks to my panelists and everyone who came…

Ah! Toni Kan was on faya!!! And Chude…bless! Ayo Sogunro gave me a copy of his book, I hear it is going to be one of the best read of my life, I can’t wait to devour!

Sylva Nze Ifedigbo and Bura-Bari Nwilo cracked us up with their delivery…Tylor Ilori's passion was intoxicating.

And Tobi Adebowale... I will have him do an audio poetry so I can listen every night. That voice!

Poetry should be heard, like love whispered in your ears, not read.  

I’m going to tidy up a screenplay before heading to bed… 

But I’ll leave you with this:

Do not trade your pearls. Be sensible, your life depends on it.

Peace!

PS: Pelu Awofeso was amazing with social media yesterday. Thank you so much!
