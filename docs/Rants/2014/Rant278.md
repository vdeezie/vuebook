November 9, 2014

I decided to buy a new phone (after all, is it my money? Toh! LOL!)

I got a Blackberry Q10 and spent the entire day trying to figure it out, find my way around this maze!

I lost all my contacts… (I know, I know, I should have done this-and-that)

I carried that gloom all the way to dinner, at WheatBaker Hotel, courtesy of Dr. Ajayi MD of Nordica Clinic. You should watch out for his medical TV show coming up soon.

After dinner, my friend- Bunmi and I went for some burlesque entertainment at Oriental Hotel. She seemed to fit in more than I was willing to allow myself to… I kept my ghetto fabulous snobbery close to my chest.

“Couldn’t they have thought of an African theme instead? Masquerades and stuff?” Bunmi said.

I wondered too.

After a few minutes, at 11pm, and all the Island pretention making me dizzy, we decided to get some light entertainment at a Bistro.

Best part of Oriental Hotel, by the way, was bumping into an old schoolmate- dapper to a T. He is the Area Manager of Martell Cognac and other brands under the company. 

Bunmi engaged him in good corporate conversation. I think they like each other. I am going to be very happy if they do. A good woman needs a, well, fine looking man.

Whilst they laughed over corporate conversation and flirted a bit (yes you did, Bunmi LOL!) I remembered a few things that turned out a miracle…

When we left the house by 5pm, Bunmi had told me to think of my worth for the day. 

“My worth?”

“Yes. What you plan to earn today. What do you think you are worth?”

It was a Saturday and sincerely all I cared about was having a good time…but I thought up a ridiculous amount just to satisfy this great friend of mine.

You see, Bunmi has travelled all over the world and held key corporate positions in many multi-national companies. She reads that book- The Secret. So you understand, she comes from a different school of thought.

The real crazy part of this gist is… That shit worked.

The amount I casually thought about happened!

How crazy is that?

One meeting and it did happen.

My worth for Saturday came to pass.

Isn’t that some magical wonderment? :D

I should double that amount today, so…maybe…I can buy a Lexus SUV.

Whilst I dream of more, I will be watching Sefi Atta's new play Last Stand at Terra Kulture today.
