The Nigerian hypocrisy is the most entertaining series in the world.

Everyone climbs on social media and declares that it is wrong to date a married man…

Ok.

So where, pray tell, does Polygamy come from? 

When a man appears on the scene with four wives, and we accept it as "our culture", is that not full endorsement and right to date married men?

When a baby mama appears with a child and points at a married man to be responsible, did she fall on his phallus? Is it not a conscious affair involving two adults- one who is married? Is that not endorsing the right to date married men?

With divorcees parading new women before the ink on their divorce papers are dry, was the relationship not budding behind the scene even whilst he was still married? Is that not an endorsement to dating married men?

We know of half the town that are: married to men who were married to someone else a minute ago. They were probably dating whilst he was still married, no? Short affairs with the married boss, the fling with the hot married man who sat beside you on the plane…

Are these not day-to-day cases of dating the married man?

This aloofness and cute personal denials that we gloat in; as if it is not inside this same Naija all of us dey eat, dey shit, dey live.

Make una dey dia dey LIE like fowl.

mscheeeew!
