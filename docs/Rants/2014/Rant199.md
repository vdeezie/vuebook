Step 2, 2014

I hate to watch poor men fight…

Over poor money

In a poor industry

Of a poor country

Plenty big grammar

Poor business skills

Poor returns

Intelligent arguments

Poor marketing/managing plans

Poor…

A tummy-churning exercise

Please become millionaires quickly

So you can stop embarrassing yourselves

Get rich…

Or stay quiet.
