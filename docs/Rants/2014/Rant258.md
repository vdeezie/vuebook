I find twitter unbearable. But I was convinced to give it a try a few months back and, I'll admit, I do find it great for PR.

Tweeps are tricked to believe they have a life and their opinions actually count.

Rid of this platform, many have no social justification to exist.

They are constant mockers, jokers and critics who really just need to find a vibrant career to focus on.

You could tweet until you turn 50 and be ignorant of how time has gone, and how little you have achieved, as all you do is find a bunch of conversation you could plug in your “Hmmm” “No” “Ewww” “Never” “Hahaha” “Huh?” 

No original ideas, just a peer-pressured life to sound like one-of-the-clever-ones with cool retorts.

But you are wasting away.

I have gone through the tweet-thoughts of people whom I thought should just be contented having sex every other day, and someone to call when their toe hurts.

There’s not much else to their person. Not much to even hold on to if anyone decides to, well, give them a run for their twitter bread soaked in urine.

Like high-school students who sit at the back giggling at the ones with straight As; they do badly in academic, but they know the latest random gist…and all the monosyllables to follow.

Twitter stays breeding ‘em.
