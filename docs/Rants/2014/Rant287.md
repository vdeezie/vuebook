I had an accident once on an okada. The rider tried to avoid a moving truck the only way okada riders know how to avoid a moving truck- running straight into the road and hoping that everything would stay still for it (okada) to go its merry way. The truck, of course, maddened by this ant of a machine, zoomed passed and the wind- just a tuft of wind, threw us both (rider and me) into an empty gutter.
I was 15, and I was confused. I still have the scars on my leg.

One time, after graduation and no mobile phones, my boyfriend convinced me we should go on a ‘ride” from Festac to Ikeja on an okada! He was certain the wind in my hair, caressing our skin would repair the relationship that was about to crack. The Hausa rider was intrigued by this love birds, and when boyfie would tell him to “drive small small”, he would drive small-small. It was crazy, but…well. I wouldn’t try that shit now though.

When I went to get a pair of sandals at a boutique, I met the sales girl with a large cut to her lips. The last time I saw her, she was fine, no cut. So what happened?
“Okada oh. Accident. I almost die. See nah? Who go marry me with this kain wound for my mouth?” she mourned and cried and hissed and died many times before I left. As if my presence provoked something she believed she would never have.

So one day, as I stood at the bus stop, an okada rider stopped in front of me: “where?” he asked.
Attacked by his bad breath, a dirty shirt that hung threadbare on his shoulders like a corpse, weather-beaten slippers and feet that had not felt water in days… I realised how unreasonable it was to put my life in the hands of this type every time.

The urgency to jump on an okada doesn’t give the Nigerian a minute to evaluate the person who might have to determine how you’d spend the rest of your life- whether with a scar up your nose or in a casket. 

Take a moment and see- can you trust that dude with marijuana-glistening eyes to take you anywhere? 
Look again, isn’t he…like…17 years old? 
Look again: what is that sore on his lips? 
And again: doesn’t he look dehydrated, about to pass out? 

My last okada ride was six years ago. I am certain I would have lost an essential part of my body and spirit if I didn’t take one look at that rider who stopped in front of me and asked, “where?”

“Nowhere."
