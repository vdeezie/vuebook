5 things...

Do not blur your children’s young heads with religion. There is a God, yes; but there are people too, and they have to learn how to deal with human beings first. Through that exercise they will find God without the pressure from anyone.

Have an open mind. There are 99 ways to interpret one problem. Sitting on one conceited interpretation makes you a bigot. When your chances to anything is narrowed to 1 out of 99 every time then you can safely be called "dumb".

Don’t be stupid. Don’t get married without a financial plan. Love was not created to be enough; it will never be enough. Don’t have kids. Stop having kids. Please! Think it through and then think about it again. Nigeria cannot hold one extra child. There are no health facilities, poor communication from all strata of development, education is a big fat joke. We are losing hold of the seam of the Nigerian fabric.

Do not hold grudges, make money instead. Do not fight an Ex. The best job I got this year was from an Ex; he is happily married now but we remained very good friends. He introduced me to someone who introduced me to a group of somebodies who happen to be huge fans of my writing and have loaded my desk with writing gigs that would literally sustain me for the next 5 years! I don't burn bridges if I can help it; for Exes I will not stoke the flames of hate. It's so beneath common sense.

Buy maturity, sell your ego: Your ego makes you the tough shit with your friends and blinds you to empathy. If you have any sense by now, you’ll find out that all of life’s profound successes are tied to empathy. You don’t get it until you can put yourself in the other person’s position and treat them accordingly. 

I should just start a school of alternate gospel, ya know.
