Name one person who’ll be there when it’s hot, when it’s cold. When I call in the night crying; when I’m happy, confused…

When I feel like shit; unsure of what to do; where to pick up after a hurricane…

One person who has seen me mad, calm, tired, energized…

Who has seen me with millions and with none…

One who has stopped judging me by my moods, my eccentricities…who calls me the “crazy artiste”…

One who thinks I’m beautiful with fried hair and strong opinions…

That one I call at any time of the day and would leave all to find me...

Who I have shared my regrets, my joys, my fears, my dreams, a shitload of artistic madness…

One who has seen me in all my bright colours, and sometimes gloomy

That one friend who just never gives up no matter what she hears… and she has heard it all- from the resentful to the most ridiculous remarks…

And yet loves me.

Prisca Egbukuchi, in this lifetime, I will repay you for your relentless friendship.

Thank you.
