There’s nothing altruistic about having children

Adults engage in a lot of sex that gives them a lot of pleasure, then one gets pregnant…

Married women need to fall in line to tick the next box by having kids.

A woman needs to tie a boyfriend down, so she gets pregnant (then realises you cannot tie anyone who needs to go…)

A man wants to be seen as responsible so he desires children.

He wants to fit into discussions with his peers, as all they talk about these days are grouchy wives and noisy kids in that oh-so sweet imperfection of family life; so he gets a couple of those himself- children, that is

Who else?

The 63 year old woman who, after a hundred years, finally gives birth to twins; she just wants to prove to the world that, well, she too can get pregnant. And have the opportunity to silence all those naysayers who mocked and gossiped, as though her barrenness was some kind of disease.

Nobody gives birth looking forward to sacrificing their whole life and dreams and worth to somebody else. 

Childbearing completes us in that prosaic manner that humans are expected to fulfill, without much thought or reason.

Like food and hunger.

So when you call me and tell me you are a single mother struggling with six children…

That information, in itself, should not generate pity; why should it? It was pleasure before it became kids (unless the lover was a selfish one). 

You enjoyed the orgasms and the  ooohs-and-aaahs; valid gratification for adults.

So now you are single with six kids; in typical Nigerian form I am supposed to go:

“eeeyaaah! Please send your bank account!”

Why? 

Why should your decision to enjoy sex so much that you drop 1…2…3…4…5…6 kids turn me to a casual philanthropist? And why should you make it look like my decision would determine if I make heaven or not?

I really think, beyond our sense of pity and fervour to drop a coin in the metal bucket (with its resounding halleluyah clunk), we need to start preaching an alternative gospel; an overhaul of many things we were taught.
