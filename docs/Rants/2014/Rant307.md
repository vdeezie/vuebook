10 things...

Beyonce’s Heat is a really bad perfume. Expensive shit. I like JLo’s Glow better. Or add the extra thousands and just buy Burberry and rest.

You can’t watch Denzel Washington’s Training Day on DSTV; half the conversation is censored, all the fun parts- ‘fuck’ ‘nigga’ ‘shit’

“Before Sunset” is a movie with just two people having a conversation. Over 10 years old. Watched it for the first time yesterday. Loved it.

The best thing that happened to me this year is brilliant sentences: “She was still young, a woman who had made a mark on life with her elegance and social drive, but who was now slowly withering in the aroma of camphor that rose from her widow’s crepe.” Amazing!

The friend I am supposed to travel to Ethiopia then Dubai with is ill. I mean, physically ill. Is this life? The painful thought of being in this country with all the political nonsense is just annoying.

I have not had a weave on in seven months. Next year I’m getting a punk.

I have lost weight. My clothes are saggy, my shorts are sexier. I am at the moment playing with my belly button.

I don’t have any kind of relationship with food anymore. I don’t understand.

Saturday was mum’s birthday. I bought pizza instead. And a bottle of Baileys’. We finished the pizza during a one hour conversation. She stays alone, I stay alone. And in between us are two kids that spend every fortnight in both places. My kids hate cake, I hate cake. Mum needs to lose weight. So who’s eating?

I joined Linkedin. I hope it is not going around my contacts begging them to “please add me to your Linkedin network” like I receive from others. I hate that.
