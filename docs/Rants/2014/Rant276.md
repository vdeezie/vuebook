I was interviewed recently, the interviewer had asked: “Where does your energy come from? How do you manage to do all that you do?”

“I’d rather not be here," I said, "I’d rather be dead, ‘cos I am tired of the small lives we live; the emptiness of our existence; the ridiculous choices we make; our daily shouts of ‘I am happy’- an endorsement of sort, a covering of our barrenness; of true sorrow; because happiness has no form, nebulous. So when we try to give it form, it is orchestrated/schemed for a cause. The saddest people are those who squeal about happiness, I have learnt. I am tired of really stupid people. Just general fatigue. So I am just waiting, you know, until it is time. And while I wait, I try to bring all the ideas I have that I’d have been too afraid to do if I cared much for life, I bring them together. I get a team together, get the resources, the backbone and a group of people who think I am special, and we have a good time. That’s my energy- not wanting to live is all the motivation I have in life.”

You should have seen her face. The expression was priceless.

LOL!
