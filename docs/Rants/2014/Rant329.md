2014 throwback *heehee*

The first time I noticed Tobi Adebowale, it was his writing that got me.

So enamoured by his flair for words, I invited him to Lagos for a party.

It was the official unveiling of my CD, “Tina’s Shoes and Love Issues” by The Magazine Club at Koga Lounge

When I set up that Club, it was to give busy employees/employers an avenue to relax and take a break from life’s hustle. So you find people who just want to kick off their shoes and go crazy.

Everyone was expecting Tobi. This was Joy’s guest coming all the way from Ife. Cool stuff, yea?

When he finally arrived, Tobi sat close to the edge of a 3-seater couch and froze literally for 3 hours (LOL!)

He turned to his right, he saw a woman smoking; he looked to his left and spotted another drinking Hennessy. Voices were loud, cliques were formed- some played snooker, others sat on a different side of the club talking about stuff people are usually too shy to talk about.

Yvonne looked at me like, “What’s up with your friend? Did he leave his tongue in Ife?” LOL!

Jay whispered into my ears, “Babe, this dude is going to shrink to a tiny ball any minute from now oh. He’s awfully uncomfortable. Do something.”

Ah! Me? No oh! Me, I was up on my feet dancing alone.

Tobi played with his fingers, kept a smile that I thought would hurt him if it lasted any minute longer.

And so the day ended after I said, “Hi” three hours later. He stammered and recovered. And then food was served. He had a Coke, I think.

But Tobi is now a Lagos bobo. Done with school, he comes to my events in crisp red shirts, brown moccasin and confidence as fine and great as his writing.

He’s got good intuition too. He always knows when to send those text messages that lift my spirit, and knows when to call and say something like: “You know you are the best, right? Joy, you are strong and with a heart of gold.”

Awwwww.

He is single now. And available for a good woman (I've told him to read fiction and poetry and he'll be fine. But, you know, there are other needs nah)

That's my baby. If you hurt him, you hurt me.

I’m serious!

Here’s to good friendships! :D
