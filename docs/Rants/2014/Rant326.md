Na wa!

All these attributes of health and happiness they ascribe to sex though...

If it was actually that serious, some of us would be dead by now; or at best wrinkled and miserable in our 30s.

I have gone two years without sex. As a full blown adult in my 30s.

I have done countless one-year abstinence from when I was 25 till date. Countless.

At present, I have gone 6 months without it.

I am still alive oh. And I dare say, happy.

I am still pretty cool in many fabulous ways.

It's not that deep abeg! Give us a break with all this scientific inferences.

Jeez!

There's a whole lot of living to enjoy without sex. Shit is exaggerated to a point of stupor.
