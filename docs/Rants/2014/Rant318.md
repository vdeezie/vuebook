We are in one of the exquisite rooms at the newest boutique hotel in town.

The bed? Heavenly. Those sheets? Divine.

We've all agreed: we shall bring our men, take four rooms and make sweet love- all weekend.

You should too! *wink*

You only live once.

Location: Maison Fahrenheit, Ademola Adetokunbo, Victoria Island.

And while you are ravishing each other, remember to place an order from the kitchen. Nky Iweka is an excellent chef!
