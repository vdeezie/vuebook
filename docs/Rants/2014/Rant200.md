I’m quite chuffed with the relationship my kids have

It’s pretty cool

They are really close. They are not just sisters but good friends.

To be fair 80% of the work was accomplished by the younger one, Jolade.

Jolade will wait for her sister, Ife, while she takes a dump. 

She'll stand by, inhaling poop air, and having a conversation through the door.

She would sneak to her sister's bed at night, just so she can share her space and curl beside her like a kitten.

She would insist on the games they play- the ones that would require two of them actively involved; ensuring there’s always something to do as a team

They chat about Disney shows till the still of the night 

They have so much in common. I hear them laughing in the living room, chatting and enjoying friendship.

It’s really heart-warming for me because I didn’t make that much effort with my own sister.
***
She’s a half-sister and it was a complicated relationship whilst growing up, controlled by adult sentiments.

I have stayed suspicious, aloof and indifferent to all her overtures of sisterly love and unanimity over the years.

Polygamy remains the culprit. There was distrust wrecking my young heart growing up with other children from other mothers whose mothers were just, well, unhappy with mine. 

So when I became a woman and I could make my own choices, I broke every single polygamous bond- half-brothers, half-sisters, step siblings, uncles and aunts… 

I stopped being part of that family and focused only on my maternal clique.

My half-sister would try to tie the chord and I’ll pull out quickly before I got vulnerable 

I didn’t want her in my life. I made no effort. 

She did everything; working at a relationship with someone who just wasn’t emotionally present.

We had some form of conversation along this line two weeks ago, and she told me she loved me and just could never understand why I was so oblivious of her and my paternal folks.

There are reasons of course, but...these things are complicated.

Big families scare me. The idea that I have all these aunts and uncles and siblings tied to my father is just not something I want to be identified with; especially with back stories of pure evil.

I believe my sister is a good person, and has tried to play the older sister's role for as long as I can remember

But in my head, it's just a number from a bulk of people I wish not to have a relationship with.

I will try in her case. She is a good person.
