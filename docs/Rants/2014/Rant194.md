Creepy thing happened this morning…

A neighbour was at my window to make a request. His wife had just given birth and he was complaining about this and that…

My kids were there beside me, at the window, and we listened to his quiet complaints and then a request for N3k to get a few things…

I didn’t have any money at home, so I told him to check back before noon as I would make a dash to the ATM on my way to the grocery shop

A few hours later, I drove to a nearby ATM with the kids…

Just so I was sure of the figure, I asked…

“How much did he ask for again?”

“Who?” my older daughter asked

“Our neighbour”

“Which neighbour?” they both queried

“The neighbour who came this morning asking for money nah”

“Nobody came this morning to ask for money, mummy…” the older one said, looking a bit worried.

“May be we were still asleep…” the younger one said

"What do you mean? You were both standing beside me!"

“No, mummy. Nobody came to ask us for anything this morning,” the older one insisted.

I had to take a long pause to reflect on what must have happened…

And I realised... It was a dream!

By God! It felt so real, but it was a dream.

When we got back home, we met the neighbour downstairs taking a walk. He smiled, greeted and went his merry way… no request.

I had to pinch myself.

I’m still shocked at how real it all seemed.
