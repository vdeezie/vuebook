The joy of any kind of accomplishment for the Nigerian is measured by how unnecessary the pursuit is.

For instance, I have never understood why, in tertiary institution, I had to go to 20 different places in that dingy premises to register for a new course or a new session, or to get the receipts for what I paid for.

Why do we need 6 days to register for a class? To get receipts for fees? To get necessary documents or authorization? Why can’t we get it done in one office, with one official, with one invoice? 

If you lose your international passport, you have to go all the way to Abuja; spend, at least, 4 days to get a new one. Why? Why can’t I get it sorted in Lagos or Ibadan or Kaduna?

Why do we like to suffer the next person so badly?

Drivers’ License. Same shit. You wait for decades to get the final product. Why?
Is it impossible to take a picture, scan it through the computer, send the data and watch the documents slip through a printer…or whatever?

Why do we have to wait for three months to get what we should?

Same madness happens at the Ports daily. Goods are delayed for the heck of it; procedures made hellish just to frustrate the next Nigerian. Why?

You have N10k in your wallet, you are owing someone N3k. Yet with a frown you insist, “wait till end of the month.” Why? The money is right in your pocket. Bring it out, pay your debt and use the rest to buy some dignity!

Relationships. Same thing. From bosses to friends to this-and-that, We badger the next person, we become a bundle of headache to the next man. We argue points that cannot hold water.
Because we have been raised in a society that enjoys the look of misery the next man wears. It makes us feel powerful!

Most of the things we kill ourselves over are simple issues that can be sorted over a drink or two, yet we allow it to linger for years…because we are just sadists and idiots and a lot of other unpleasant things.

This helps me a lot, maybe you should try it: before you think of making the next person take the long route to get something that is already in your hands, think of death…

We are all going to die. That should foster love, yet we waste our time on trivial nonsense, insubstantial shit; wasting the years we could smile together, fighting each other. 

If you don’t confront your stupidities here, you will deal with them on the "other side": 

Mr. Kardashian has died and must have met with Nicole Brown Simpson (OJ Simpson’s wife) and they would have had that talk ("you knew he killed me, yet you represented him and let him get away with it! How's that fucking cancer of the throat doing? You'll never get to lie as a lawyer ever again.") I know. I know. I'm dramatic LOL!

Sani Abacha has met with MKO Abiola, abi? Toh!

Your grandmother has finally met with that neighbour she spent her entire 60s fighting and badgering. Her tongue and selfishness sent the poor neighbour to an early grave...etc etc.

Time is all we have. Why do we waste it playing the hot shit?
