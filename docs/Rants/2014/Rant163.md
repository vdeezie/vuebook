Life is commerce.

And if practised with flair, respect and value, achieving mutually beneficial results for all parties involved, then life would have been lived.

From the partners we choose to be with, to the friends we keep, acquaintances we leave hanging on BBM, we are selling our hearts, our friendships for a piece of what they are willing to give back.

Most of the time, it’s bad business.

You fall in love with a crack head that is obsessed with chaos

You end up with friends that are of no benefit to your immediate or long term values/goals

You keep acquaintances who rant about having dinner with Dangote and Adenuga, talk about their big businesses and flamboyant missions…then when it comes to the point where life is expected to play out its commercial value, they leave your messages hanging like a wet cloth.

I have lived the non-commerce life for so long to know that I have been a fool.

Relationships are meant to make you better. They are your best investments. Isn’t that why we spend so much money on private education for our kids- so they can come out someday and build a good life for themselves, and return some of the love and care we gave? 

We are taught to love. Love a moron if you must but make sure your heart skips and melts and tumbles and skates when his/her name is mentioned. We watch shows where people justify their messed up lives made miserable by another human being, and in conclusion- the one sentence that makes everybody melt into their shoes would be:

“I love him (or her).” balancing the act with tears for good effect. 

Super depressing!

I am not teaching my kids none of that. Because I have lived that way and now I know it is BS.

Love too is commerce- like a career, like everything else.

It’s a trade. If I love him, he should love me back. Treat me right. Watch the shit that comes out of his mouth. Ensure we are not in some tumultuous, juvenile fanfare that drains us of common sense and emotions.

If those things are not guaranteed and the repetition of poor trade/exchange is thrown in your face; it’s time you start another business. That one is bad business, as bad as losing your money at the stock exchange.

For the average Nigerian this would sound impossible, because we are in a fraudulent environment where the mention of “commerce” would first suggest you are begging for help, impoverished or dubious.

We don't know how to build good rewarding relationships. 

We think we should only think of rewards in office environments; the minute you step out of your suit, you cannot judge anything else based on value and return.

Wrong!

Reward should come from everything.

Love is not some foolish altruistic bore waiting to give and give and give and die on the table of giving. Love too requires something back; that is commerce.

As long as I present value, buy into value if you want. If you don’t, then why are we wasting the short time we have on earth?
