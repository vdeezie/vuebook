Relentless and grim-faced, twitter is weighing down on Linda Ikeji 

(You see why I like Facebook? We talk about love and happy cheeks here *heehee*)

This soberly satirical episode is a parody of what this society is.

Make no mistake, Linda will recover from this and all the stakeholders in the debate will find something more damaging to rely on for air.

This is Nigeria, our issues are beyond blogs plagiarising our work.

When I write on sabinews.com, it takes only 5 minutes before I see my article EVERYWHERE…

And I mean, everywhere!

Some people have even told me they wait at the door of the website, to pluck my article immediately it drops.

They mean it as flattery, unaware that it is criminal.

Some of them even gather more likes and comments than the original site.

(And some like that fuck-shit site, Nairaland, steals with a gun to my head and refuses to give me credit).

It used to bother me, but I am tired.

As long as I get my credit, I play along.

It’s shameful, I know.

But I am just tired. 

Everything will return to status quo in no time, all it would take is one pastor to fly ammunitions in his private jet to Scotland and our focus will shift as fast as men shift their gaze from woman to woman.

These moments act as camouflage for the real issues we fight- a society of abject lack tormented by a handful of celebrated wealth.

I wish it was possible for people to buy their luxury accessories and keep them away from Instagram or blogs; this need to share your success against the backdrop of cruel poverty is a ticking bomb.

Not that I blame anyone; I mean…even I had flaunted love at some point, yea?

We itch to talk about things that brighten us.

But as it seems, for material wealth…Nigerians are suffering, it is too much of a slap in the face for the average man who is moving his children from one private school to another to save some cash, to comprehend how one could possibly run a blog and make millions of naira a month.

He works 5-10pm every day, doesn’t get to see his children awake. He WORKS, back-breaking overstressed toil that earns him a neat sum to take care of the basic needs of his family.

(In this issue, let us just forget the poor. I am talking lower middle class hustle- something many of us can relate to here)

The thought of wealth that affords a blogger such expensive trappings of life, naturally builds shock, then mental turmoil, followed by emotional dialogues, and may boil to hate- but not hate that wishes death, just the kind that begins to question how and why…

And begins to seek some kind of answers from a system.

To build a mansion in the middle of slums occupied by Ilaje fishermen for instance, can be a taunting experience for the poor fishermen.

St. Paul says…ok I can’t remember exactly what the man said, but he did say something like…not eating meat if eating meat will cause your brother to sin because of his fragility.

We are fragile; our collective poverty is a delicate issue…

May be we need to thread softly with our possessions?

(Because no one can convince me this isn't about a N24m Range Rover. The issue of plagiarism in this case and the consistent witch-hunting is mainly because of what she is- rich; not some poor blogger with two hits per day)

PS: I love Linda; she’s a good soul. She has shown immense concern in matters that concerned me in the past and choose to protect me. And I will always be grateful for that.

So there.
