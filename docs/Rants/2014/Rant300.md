New, crisp and quality print of What Pain May Bring will be out next week!

Like I said to the printer who came with an entourage to my house:

"This is not a traditional wedding ceremony, there's no room for cheap sentiments, mediocre negotiations or any chance to meet halfway. You will bear the whole cost for your idiocy and incompetence."

If he's not a retard, why would he convert a PDF print-ready file to Corel Draw and expect every word to still be well-behaved? There's a reason it is tagged: "print ready"; you don't mess with it.

I shall make a bonfire later.

Thank you for your kind words/messages, everyone.
