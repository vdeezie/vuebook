I had an enchanting evening with my actor-crush, Demola Adedoyin (Prince Aderopo in October1 movie)

We spent all of 4 hours talking and analysing the Nigerian psyche.

He's also a photographer and a poet; runs a complete editing business; shoots music videos and short films (cool all round).

He shared one of his poems:

“A creature built with poise/God made what He meant/She brews a sultry repertoire, you drink it in her potion/Nothing can justify my infidelity…I saw her madness, I saw her serenity…”

He’ll be performing poetry on November 1 at an exclusive writers’ event I am organizing (Not “The Business of Writing” oh)- more details on that later.

So hold your breath, ladies.

He's a lot hotter in person :D
