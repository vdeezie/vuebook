I watched Scarlett Johansson give a kick-ass performance in "Lucy".

Lucy is, by far, my best cinematic experience of the year!

Later, Doyin joined me for drinks and dinner at Soul lounge at The Palms

 In the cocktail menu is a drink called "Pussy Galore"

 Doyin looked at the waitress, "Can I get pussy?"

 Like...so you got pussy for me?

 I died. My laughter shook the foundations of Lekki.

 I am still laughing. LMAO!

PS: These bars have the craziest names for cocktail drinks: "sex on the beach" "fuck off" "get it nasty" "make me wet" etc etc etc...

When you mix banana and pineapple and chinchin, why call it "make sweet love baby", aren't kids invited to taste these non-alcoholic drinks?

Hian oh!
