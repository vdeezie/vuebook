Like watching a disease creep in and take over your body, it is with the same frustration, hopelessness and utter resentment and bile that I feel whenever I witness an old man- in his 60s/80s- with a vituperative tongue like that of a 14 year old disgruntled (probably molested) female tomato hawker.

Look at this one, old as a rag, with high-pitched voice like Carey insulting his neighbour- a younger man, for demanding his fairness with PHCN officials.

There’s a hint of tribalism… these PHCN goats can’t help it. 

If you are of a certain tribe and you owe N40k for instance… if you can flash a smile and speak the language and laugh at a few random nothings, they leave your light to cool your freezer.

But if you are of any other tribe (especially of a particular tribe) and you owe just N1k, they will come at you with ferocious hostility, yank your wires off and tell you to go and pay your debt in their office.

Just so I don’t trigger any tribal residue, I will leave it like that.

So here, I am witnessing the excess of this injustice… 

Here is this old cow, mouthing shit because his age and his tribe warms the stupidity and incompetence of this PHCN workers…

And there is the younger man of a different tribe trying to address an unbroken habit and problem practiced unabashedly.

Old man living in a rented house till his 70s- the baby boomers who ruined this nation!

Look at his mouth, as fast as a rat dashing into a hole. If his brain worked half as fast, he would have a trail of good deeds that will build society’s future.

But he spends his last breath badmouthing, with foul words like rotten food.

I stopped giving freely any form of respect to “these people”, they will have to earn it… and I have showed them many times!

You can chew your age for breakfast, when it comes to society and life, you will earn your respect just like any person of any age would.

Respect your elders… No, these elders should learn to respect their sons and daughters.

Contrary to society’s bull opinion, age does not make you closer to God or wisdom.  It only draws you nearer to your grave.

The insults and all the curses he pours on this younger man of another tribe will only draw lines of new wrinkles on his already crumpled face.
