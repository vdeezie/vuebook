Ah! sabinews.com treats me like royalty…

Increases my pay cheque without notice…

Who does that?

Only Toni Kan!

That is how to treat writers

So now y'all know why I don’t answer your desperate emails/calls to get me to write for your websites.

I don’t write for free…

I don’t write for we-have-a-good-platform-to-push-your-writing-to-international-borders *roll eyes* 

And I, as hell, do not write for-the-fun-of-it (unless I'm loafing around my Facebook wall)!
