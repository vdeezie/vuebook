Ask this madam Actress what kind of man she wants, she’ll cry…

“I want a God fearing man who loves da Lord and loves the things of Christ. Somebody who can be there for me, show me love. I am not a materialistic perzin.”

Ask her about her hobbies…

“I spend time reading the bible. I don’t club. I am an indoor perzin. I love to cook. I am very easy going.”

Then ask her why she is grabbing her tits in this “new photos” she just released…

“I just want to be free with my body. It took me a long time to appreciate my femininity. I am empowered and I feel like I can express myself as I want. Nobody is fit to judge me. I don’t smoke, I don’t party, I don’t do drugs like some people do in diz industry. I am cool calm collected and I just want to show my talent.”

*I know my imagination is crazy, but I can bet on her knotty pony tails that her response will be as cheesy as my guess.*

mscheeeeew!
