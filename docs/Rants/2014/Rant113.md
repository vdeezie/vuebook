“I believe there’s one God…and however you find Him is a fantastic thing. I don’t knock anyone’s religion…these things are complicated…how my body is formed…how a wound heals…how my brows stop sweat from getting into my eyes…how life functions… and phases run in a certain order…there’s got to be a God.” 

– Jay Z (Oprah’s Master Class TV)
