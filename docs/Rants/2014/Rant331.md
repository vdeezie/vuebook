December 29, 2014

Err…I don’t like the slices of my 2014 Zuckerberg collated on my behalf, so I have done my own:

This is Joy’s Year:

I did a short audio drama enacted by Kate Henshaw, Uti Nwachukwu and Chioma Akpotha for IfooAfrica’s official launch

I organised ‘The Business of Writing’ and it was a hit. Thanks to Toni Kan, Chude Jideonwo, Ayo Sogunro, Adebola Omololu and others for honouring the invitation.

I conceived and hosted #MyLagosStory for IfooAfrica (which was also replicated for the Abuja audience). Well-attended, well enjoyed. Thanks to Demola Adedoyin for sharing his poetry.

I organised the literary concert, #ThisArtIsEnough. I still smile at odd hours whenever I remember just how much of a success it was. Hurry to IfooAfrica to listen to the performances if you haven't.

What else? Yes, I reigned as the undisputed mudafuckin’ queen of prose on sabinews.com, raking over 1000 likes for each article. Yelz ke! It made many mad- my flagrant opinions, and made a few excited. It made me a mudafucka :D

My book came out…and then it disappeared…to appear again January *sighs* 

That is my year in a few points. 

And I paid school fees oh, as usual, for three solid terms, effortlessly.

Like Kendrick Lamar would say: I love myself (jor)!
