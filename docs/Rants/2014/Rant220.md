*Note: As a lifestyle critic, I am only echoing a belief system in this post!*

Sometimes, society feels (that) FAT is an irresponsible CHOICE.

Calm down, calm down, let me finish…

-Because we abandon the task of eating right, exercising and making conscious healthy variances, we are left with rolls and flabs of astonishing flesh!

It is almost as irresponsible as poverty.

“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest, and your poverty will come like a robber, your need, like a bandit…”- Proverbs 6: 10-11

“A little cupcake, a round of doughnut, another hour of sleep without hitting the gym, and fat will come like a seductress; your needs like robbers sending invitation notice to residents at Palmgrove…”- Society 3: 4-5

And like poverty, or an incompetent employee, people believe it is their social responsibility to, well, advice you to shed your weight in ten different places (like they’d advice an unproductive worker to get the job done).

Society looks at YOU as her primary concern, like nosey American cops. So when it seems you fight your way into a car… when the automated door at the bank screams for one person to step out…when you pant and puff after taking 3 steps to the next office… when you have people giving you the side-eye and placing their bags on the seat next to them at the cinema, the bus because they believe your weight will spill over to their seats… it is because in society’s screwed up mind, it is trying to restrict some kind of hazard.

It is not nice. but it doesn’t hurt to understand what the average person thinks of fat.
And there’s of course the gross indiscipline of it all that society refuses to ignore.

-Because while you are telling your kid to work hard, read and excel in school; these are actions that would require self-discipline and regulation… to motivate your child while you cannot stop eating cheese cake as you watch your stomach touch the floor might seem a bit hypocritical to society.

For instance, people get upset when some random clerk at a mall notices the fold on their thighs with just the batting of the eyes one time too many. You have placed him beneath you mentally, so it hurts… and you remind him with impeccable English that you have been to places he cannot even pronounce so he should NEVER look at you like that again

Ok.

Then he nods, and also acknowledges the fact that: “I am sure you have eaten many local and international cuisine I cannot afford or even pronounce.”

The goat even has a sense of humour, and this kills you!

So you head to twitter and complain about people not minding their business.

But does anyone really mind their business? If we did, Linda Ikeji will not be rich, writers will have nothing to write about, Facebook/twitter will not exist because we come to these platforms to mind other people’s business. 

So with that tempting cone of strawberry ice cream that is going to settle within rolls of happy lard, you have gossiped about someone else before.

If you can only admit that then you'll realize that this fat issue and what society has to say is not worth all the melting blubber in a whale.
