You could pretend to be Cinderellaâ€¦

Pretend to have one shoe of a pair loitering in his house

Imagine you had a ball to attend 

You need to get what is yours

Your heart stuck to the frills of your gown

Limp to his door

And pretend the woman lying next to him

Was scraped from under muddy boots.
