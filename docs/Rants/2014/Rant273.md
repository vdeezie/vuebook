“Na Ashawo behaviour dey turn man into ordinary bread wey scatter for ground…” - Proverbs 6:26

I know say plenty people dey talk say the Bible is sexist. Issoriat. However, dis one na simple non-sexist issue...

Because “Ashawo” fit be man, woman, company wey nor add value to your life; work wey don drink your blood, chop your sense of humour. Ashawo fit be life wey just strong like khaki, e hard for you to jus’ relax and exhale.

Ashawo na de tin wey dey take too much of your time wey nor add real value for your life…

Twitter is Ashawo, or any social platform wey nor dey add one kobo inside your pocket. Na to only gather like fly to dey talk de one wey another person do wey you nor fit do.

Ashawo na society wey nor go let you do the thing wey you wan do.

Ashawo na dat person wey jus’ siddon for your life like statue wey no get anything to contribute to help you become better than yesterday.

Ashawo na dat habit wey dey wreck your bodi, your mind, your wit, your life.

Ashawo dey everywhere…

And e dey reduce “man” to ordinary crumb for ground.

Gather yourself before dog go lick the last of your worth.

Make una enjoy the new week.
