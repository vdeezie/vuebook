# Rant286

The best part of being you is YOU. No extra details, no superfluous judgments.

Should YOU not be enough in any circumstance, let it be for the next person to worry about. I don’t explain myself to anyone. Of course there’ll be a few who you let into your space, they would request for more- that extra detail, what makes you tick; but in most cases I am too indifferent, too bored to share.

People make judgments from their own experiences; it usually would have very little to do with you or what you say. So let them make their judgments and stick to it. Why should I deprive you of that mental burden?

The way life is, your grouse or your issues have no effect on the quality of life the next person lives. So, you could decide to build a castle of hate or judgments; hours you could use building your oh-so average life, then you realise you cannot push your subject of obsession to live in that house built with sweat and plenty hate rants. You are left with an empty house and hours you will never get back.

Life is gangsta like that.

Our opinions don’t matter as much as we think they do.

They never will.

At the end of it all, it is how we choose to live and the people who stand with/by us that truly count. 

I find it quite unsettling, for instance, that almost always when someone introduces himself as gay, he needs to punctuate this with God-fearing, God-loving, kind, hardworking, very decent…

Why do we need those extra weights of good to appeal to society? Society hates you already, so what? If you are a good Lifepreneur, you will kick their opinions to one corner and stand on the other side where it really counts.

So you are, say, Jessica. Jessica should be enough. You shouldn’t feel the need to tell anyone you are…*what are those words women like to throw into love conversations*- “patient” “sweet” “long suffering” “loving” “easy going” *roll eyes*

You need to be amplified to be accepted, to be deserving? Too much work. Free yourself. Why put YOU in that position? If they cannot see then they cannot see. Myopia is real.

Do you really need the suffix to your name, a roll call of virtues? Like an endorsement tailored to fit?

I am Joy.

And that is enough.

I will leave you to make your conclusions; knock yourself out, while I go on to live my life.

Deal?
