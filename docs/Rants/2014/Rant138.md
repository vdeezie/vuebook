Day2 and I am still ranting about Love and Nigerians...

When my girls grow up to be young women, I will sit them down and tell them candidly:

Love, in Africa, is an acquired taste.

You’ll do well to find love amongst the "originals"- the people who, it seems, created it. Go to France and meet a good man there.

Enjoy a real french kiss, have a man hold your hand through busy streets, relish eye contact that makes your eyes moist and your heart light. Meet the originals and see how they love; love that will not judge you for loving and loving intensely and shamelessly. Enjoy casual love gifts and love surprises…

But if you insist on loving a black man- a Nigerian, realise this:

The Nigerian whether poor, middle-class or rich holds the same views about love.

They wear over-sized egos, they will rebuke you endlessly over e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g and soon it will become a hobby- rebuking you like a maid. 
You will be scolded for everything- for cold eba and for un-laid beds. They will find your need to be girly-in-love odd and annoying and would instruct you to act your age and demand nothing! 

They will walk ahead of you always; make you feel an inch shorter- or more. They are suspicious always (even the idiotic poor is suspicious that you want to possess him). 

It’s in our DNA to rebuff love. We like to think of it as disposable and disrupting.

He will not make any meaningful sacrifice for you. No compromises. Love will become a routine, a drag.

If you want to live that way for the rest of your life, it is your choice.

Or you can skip all of these absurdities, and move some place where the men are willing to experience love in all its beauty...in it's totality.

-Because you deserve it.

I don talk my own.
