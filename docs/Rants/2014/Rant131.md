First they do something as idiotic as buying into a misunderstanding that is totally none of their business. 

They take over the squabble, becoming the self-proclaimed jaundiced judge.

Then they pitch their tent on the other side.

All the while, the two original “friends” are privately sorting their issues out.

Soon they are left in the cold- unsure of what role they played in all of this.

They make desperate plans to fix it.

They go into PR mode, trying to caress your ego. 

You see links of your articles/essays on their Facebook wall; they are tweeting stuff about you, hailing you; trying to get your attention. Trying to win back what was lost in a fight that was never theirs to contest.

You starve them of any kind of attention because you know, like prostitutes, they are up for the loudest hype, the foulest bullshit.

Ignore them. Gosh, are they even humans?

They carry on with the shenanigan.

You don’t attend to their neediness, so they move swiftly to the next person- someone they feel is your competition (a poor rival at best); and the mindless trumpet-blowing continues.

It’s still a bait to get your attention.

You will not give them that attention, you never will.

Someday, they will tire of their entire gimmick.

And hopefully face their own lives, their own business…

A poor excuse for a man, see how low you have sunk. You leave comments like faeces on the floor, wet slippery diarrhoea: 

"Oh I haff laff oh! Dis is superfiliciousnesstastic."

Huh? LMAO! Stupid much?

Grow up, son.

RA shouldn’t be the initials for "Retarded Associate".
