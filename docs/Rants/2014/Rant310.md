Twitter, the shit I don't have to smell again.

I know they are shitting, but I don't have to smell it.

That, my people, is being in control.

Instagram doesn't even exist.

My vanity is of a different kind.

Facebook, hmmm! This one I shall handle with a lot of care. 

You see, I made every penny in 2014 on Facebook.

E-v-e-r-y.

Every connection, every meeting, every funding happened because this page exists.

You don't treat that kind with a wave of the hand.

Show some respect.

I respect you, Facebook.

Let's talk about this over dinner and see how we can spend a large chunk of 2015, apart.
