The saddest thing about “moving on with life” without addressing your parents over issues you think have destroyed your sense of peace, especially as Nigerians with our very queer way of nurturing, is that you never truly move on- you are stuck in between progression and regression.

You are pulled back every time you remember what your mother said when you were 10; you can taste bitterness on your tongue every time you recall how your father treated you… it’s always going to be there.

And when you become an adult you’ll pour your pain into the soul of a partner, maybe, who suffers all the resentment you have nurtured in your heart. 

-because the Nigerian culture does not expect you to call your mother to order, or confront your father for his utterances when you were merely a kid; and how those words he said have shaped you.

You look alright; you are a lawyer, a banker, you run a business, you have a partner… it seems life is just fine. But you are hurting; you still remember what your parent said to you when you were barely 13 and how much it hurt you then…it still kills you now.

You have tried to shake it off; it never leaves…and then your partner who loves you walks into the house at that moment of burden, and your resentment clouds the room and affects your relationship, your outlook to everything.

This feeling may happen once every quarter… you hate that you cannot forget. You are ashamed that you still hold on to something that happened over two decades ago.

You owe it to the new people in your life- colleagues, friends, lover, acquaintances to sort out the issues haunting you from the past.

Have a seat with your mother and tell her: “I have been very bitter for twenty years because of what you said when I was ten…”

Look your father in his eyes and say to him: “I have struggled with violence because of the way you treated my mother. I hate that I had to see you hit her when I was just three…”

There’s too much pain buried in the average family. The discomfort of addressing issues, so as not to rattle the seeming peace that exists, is fastened to everyone’s neck.

You should sit on a table of feast one day with your perfect family, look across the table and tell everyone… “Uncle raped me when I was seven…”

How’s that for dessert?

You may not get the kind of response you desire…as a matter of fact, there's a 99% chance you will not. 

Years have a way of forgiving itself and leaving you alone to figure out how you decide to handle stuff.

Draw those years back and seek healing.

Your constant distrust, anger and bitterness are linked to something. What is it?

For many people it is family and the fibre of offense and secrecy that needs to be addressed.

Your parents are after all humans, vulnerable and likely to err.

Get the healing you need and let them tell you, regardless of the belligerent subservient, almost fearful method of parenting in Nigeria, that…

“My child, I am sorry.”

Get them to apologise…explanation might open old wounds, but apology... they owe you that much.

They owe you that much for their mistakes that have tainted your views of life and others.
